09:30:26   19   Q.   And is it your understanding that Mr. Hilmes reviewed

09:30:29   20   that patent right after this lawsuit was filed?

09:30:32   21   A.   Yes, he did.

09:31:10    5   BY MR. BAXTER:

09:31:10    6   Q.   Can you -- do you see the paragraph, Mr. Prasad, where

09:31:13    7   it says:    It is our belief that collaborations are the best

09:31:17    8   solution to this matter?

09:31:23    9              Does that indicate there's a problem that needs a

09:31:23   10   solution?

09:31:23   11   A.   No, it doesn't, because it's still collaboration, and,

09:31:32   12   yeah, I don't interpret it that way.
