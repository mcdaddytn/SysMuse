04:36:42    4   Q.   And so you know that at the time of this book, no one

04:36:45    5   had put all these elements together, right?

04:36:48    6   A.   That's correct.

04:36:48    7   Q.   And that you can't point to anyone prior to 2010 who,

04:36:54    8   if ever, put any of these elements all together into the

04:36:57    9   claim of the patent, right, sir?

04:36:59   10   A.   That's not correct.

04:37:00   11   Q.   You can't point to any single reference that you've

04:37:04   12   identified today where someone has put together all the

04:37:08   13   elements into Claim 1 of the patent, right, sir?

04:37:11   14   A.   That's correct.   But outside of the context of the

04:37:17   15   report --

04:37:18   16            MR. RUBINO:    Move to strike the remainder,

04:37:20   17   Your Honor.

04:37:20   18            THE COURT:    I'll sustain the objection that the

04:37:23   19   answer is non-responsive after "that's correct."           And I'll

04:37:26   20   strike that portion of the answer after "that's correct."

04:37:29   21            MR. RUBINO:    Pass the witness.

04:37:30   22            THE COURT:    All right.     Redirect, Mr. Re?

04:37:39   23            I'll take it as a yes since you've gone back to

04:37:42   24   the podium.

04:37:43   25            MR. RE:   Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry.

04:37:54    7   BY MR. RE:

04:37:54    8   Q.   You were -- your cross-examination began with this

04:38:10    9   discussion, and counsel showed you only the words at the

04:38:13   10   top of Paragraph 89.       Do you remember that?

04:38:15   11   A.   Yes.

04:38:15   12   Q.   And what were you discussing in Paragraph 89 where

04:38:19   13   counsel didn't show you what's below it?

04:38:22   14   A.   Well, counsel was asking about super directive

04:38:30   15   beamforming, and I had stated -- may I go on?

04:38:33   16   Q.   Yes, if you're going to explain.

04:38:35   17   A.   Yes.    The question was, is the super directive


04:39:47   15   A.   That is correct.

04:39:48   16   Q.   The Li paper --

04:39:49   17            THE COURT:     Just a minute, counsel.

04:39:52   19            MR. RUBINO:     Objection, leading, Your Honor.

04:39:54   20            THE COURT:     Sustained as to leading.

04:39:57   21            Restate your question in a non-leading form.

04:40:01   22   Q.   (By Mr. Re)   Can you just give me your conclusions and

04:40:04   23   explain whether any of your conclusions rely in any way on

04:40:07   24   the Saric reference?

04:40:08   25   A.   My conclusion was that Claims 1 -- Claims 1 and 8 of

04:40:13    1   the '049 patent were invalid based on the prior art.            Those


04:42:16   24   Q.   And did you find any -- any real-world facts that have

04:42:22   25   any connection with respect to the invention that could in

04:42:31    4             MR. RUBINO:    Both leading and beyond the scope of

04:42:33    5   cross.

04:42:33    6             THE COURT:    I'll sustain as to leading.

04:42:37    7   Q.   (By Mr. Re)     Did you understand at all what counsel was
