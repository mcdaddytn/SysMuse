# Extended Tactical Paths in I.P. Litigation

## 1. Technical Expert on Infringement
- **Plaintiff’s Direct**
  - Lay out the patent claims in plain terms, then map them onto the accused product.  
  - Use demonstratives (source code excerpts, schematics, product manuals).  
  - Decision: Go detailed (risk losing jury in jargon) vs. keep simple (risk defense calling it superficial).  

- **Defendant’s Cross**
  - Attack methodology: “You cherry-picked the code sample.”  
  - Highlight gaps: “You didn’t review the full firmware.”  
  - Suggest bias: “You’re being paid $800/hour.”  
  - Strategy: Surgical cross is usually better — jurors dislike over-complexity.  

- **Plaintiff’s Redirect**
  - Clarify scope: “Yes, the sample was representative because XYZ.”  
  - Reframe bias: “I’m compensated regardless of outcome.”  
  - Decision: Minimal redirect to avoid recross unless defense scored a clean hit.  

- **Defendant’s Recross**
  - If redirect sounds defensive, seize it.  
  - Re-ask in yes/no format: “You didn’t test all versions, correct?”  
  - Risk: May come off as piling on if redirect was weak.

## 2. Damages Expert
- **Plaintiff’s Direct**
  - Build foundation for royalty calculation: industry practice, Georgia-Pacific factors.  
  - Walk jury through models step-by-step.  
  - Decision: Frame damages as reasonable and grounded, not speculative.  

- **Defendant’s Cross**
  - Attack assumptions: “You assumed 10% market adoption — why?”  
  - Undercut comparables: “Those licenses weren’t litigated, were they?”  
  - Show exaggeration: “Your calculation equals more than defendant’s annual profits.”  
  - Aggressive cross more common here, since jurors are alert to money issues.  

- **Plaintiff’s Redirect**
  - Restore credibility by showing conservative assumptions.  
  - Point to industry acceptance of methods.  
  - Decision: Strong redirect can neutralize damages skepticism.  

- **Defendant’s Recross**
  - If redirect strays into new ground (e.g., economic trends), use recross to trap expert.  
  - Otherwise, often best to skip — jurors dislike “math fights” that drag on.

## 3. Fact Witness (Inventor or Engineer)
- **Plaintiff’s Direct**
  - Humanize the inventor — origin story of the patent.  
  - Emphasize diligence, problem-solving, and uniqueness.  
  - Keep it simple: no need to over-technicalize.  

- **Defendant’s Cross**
  - Attack memory: “This patent was filed 15 years ago, how can you recall details?”  
  - Undermine credibility: “You no longer work at the plaintiff company, correct?”  
  - Light, respectful cross often plays better — aggressive tone can alienate jury.  

- **Plaintiff’s Redirect**
  - Clarify limited memory attacks.  
  - Anchor testimony in documents contemporaneous with invention.  

- **Defendant’s Recross**
  - Rarely useful — most fact witnesses don’t require extended iterations.

## 4. Industry/Market Expert
- **Plaintiff’s Direct**
  - Position plaintiff as innovator in market space.  
  - Tie adoption trends to patent importance.  

- **Defendant’s Cross**
  - Attack relevance: “Your report relied on market data that excludes Asia, correct?”  
  - Undercut expertise: “You’re not a practicing economist, are you?”  

- **Plaintiff’s Redirect**
  - Reestablish credentials.  
  - Explain why selected data set is reliable.  

- **Defendant’s Recross**
  - Useful only if redirect strays into fresh justifications.

# Strategic Patterns by Witness Type

- **Technical experts** → Most iterative (Redirect/Recross often used).  
- **Damages experts** → Cross is centerpiece; Redirect can salvage credibility, but risks recross.  
- **Inventors/fact witnesses** → Usually limited to Direct + Cross; Redirect sparingly used.  
- **Market experts** → Similar to damages, but shorter cycles (jurors fatigue faster).

✅ **Takeaway for I.P. Attorneys:**  
The choice to extend beyond Cross hinges on **witness type**.  
- For experts, iterations are common and sometimes necessary.  
- For fact witnesses, less is more — Redirect risks refreshing defense themes.  
- Jurors reward clarity and brevity; judges enforce it.
