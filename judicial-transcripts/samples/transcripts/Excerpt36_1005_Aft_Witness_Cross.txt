04:56:28   23   Q.   Well, Mr. Re questioned Dr. Zhu about this very issue,

04:56:33   24   and she talked to him about the fact -- I mean, talked to

04:56:36   25   Dr. Li about the fact that that CrispMic came out in 2018,

04:56:41    1   and, indeed, the patent itself came out in 2018, correct?

04:56:45    2   A.   The '049 patent came out in 2018, yes.

04:56:48    3   Q.   Some four years after the Echo product?

04:56:51    4   A.   Yes.

04:56:59    5               MR. DACUS:   Your Honor, at this point, I think I'm

04:57:01    6   going to need to go into some financial information that we

04:57:06    7   would, under the Court's procedures, need to seal the

04:57:08    8   courtroom for.     If I can ask the Court to please seal the

04:57:11    9   courtroom.

04:57:11   10               THE COURT:   All right.   Based on counsel's request

04:57:13   11   and an indication that he's about to go into confidential

04:57:16   12   information, I'll order the courtroom sealed at this time.

04:57:18   13               Those of you present, not subject to the

04:57:21   14   protective order, should excuse yourselves and remain

04:57:23   15   outside the courtroom until the courtroom is unsealed and

04:57:26   16   reopened.

04:57:27   17               (Courtroom sealed.)

04:57:27   18               (This portion of the transcript is sealed

04:57:27   19               and filed under separate cover as

04:57:28   20               Sealed Portion No. 2.)

05:38:20   21               (Courtroom unsealed.)

05:38:28   22               THE COURT:   Ladies and gentlemen, we're at a point

05:38:30   23   where I will ask the Plaintiff who their next witness is.

05:38:34   24               MR. FABRICANT:   Your Honor, subject to the

05:38:36   25   admission and receipt into evidence of the pre-admitted

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 333 Filed 10/09/20 Page 118 of 120 PageID #: 19164

05:38:40    1   exhibits which were used in court today, the Plaintiff

05:38:44    2   rests its case.

05:38:46    3           THE COURT:     All right.     The Plaintiff having

05:38:49    4   rested its case-in-chief, we are at a point where it's

05:38:55    5   appropriate to begin with the Defendants' case-in-chief but

05:39:00    6   not this late in the day.

05:39:01    7           We will recess for the evening at this time.             I'm


05:39:44   20   tomorrow.

05:39:45   21           The jury is excused at this time.

05:39:47   22           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

05:39:49   23           (Jury out.)

05:39:49   24           THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

05:40:14   25           Let me remind you, counsel, of my earlier

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 333 Filed 10/09/20 Page 119 of 120 PageID #: 19165
                                                                                    829



05:40:20    1   directive that you jointly meet and confer and submit to


05:40:56   10   I'll look for those not later than 3:00 o'clock tomorrow.

05:40:58   11             Are there questions from either Plaintiff or

05:41:00   12   Defendant before we recess for the evening?

05:41:03   13             MS. TRUELOVE:   Nothing from Plaintiff, Your Honor.

05:41:06   15             THE COURT:   All right.     I will be in chambers, if

05:41:08   16   needed.   Otherwise, I will see you in the morning.           I'll be

05:41:11   17   in chambers in the morning, if needed, and whether you need

05:41:14   18   me or not, we will start as close to 8:30 as possible.

05:41:17   19             MS. TRUELOVE:   Your Honor, if I could, I had a

05:41:19   20   paralegal whispering in my ear.       Does the Court have our

05:41:23   21   time used at this point?

05:41:25   22             THE COURT:   I can give you that or very close

05:41:28   23   approximation, Ms. Truelove.

05:41:29   24             MS. TRUELOVE:   Thank you.

05:41:30   25             THE COURT:   As of now, my calculations are that

05:41:34    1   the Plaintiff has used 9 hours and 41 minutes and has 3

05:41:52    6              THE COURT:    Anything further from either Plaintiff

05:41:54    7   or Defendant?
