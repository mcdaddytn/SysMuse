  "contextDescription": "Wireless scheduling patents address how wireless resources (time, frequency, spatial) are allocated among users and services. This includes MAC layer protocols, resource block scheduling, coexistence between technologies (e.g., LTE-WiFi-Bluetooth), and interference coordination.
