09:15:45    2            (Venire panel in.)

09:15:52    3            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

09:15:53    4            THE COURT:    Good morning.      Please be seated.

09:24:07    5            Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.          Thank you for

09:24:19    6   being here.

09:24:20    7            My name is Rodney Gilstrap, and I am the Chief

09:24:25    8   United States District Judge for the U.S. District Court

09:24:28    9   for the Eastern District of Texas.

09:24:30   10            I have lived in Marshall since 1981, when I got

09:24:34   11   out of law school.     I practiced law in this community and

09:24:37   12   in the general East Texas area for 30 years.           And in 2011 I

09:24:44   13   was appointed to this position and have been here ever

09:24:47   14   since.

09:24:47   15            I have a confession to make to all of you.            I was

09:24:50   16   not born in Texas, but I got here as quick as I could.

09:24:54   17            I came to Texas to attend college and then law

09:24:57   18   school at Baylor University in Waco.

09:25:00   19            I am married.     I have two grown children.         And my

09:25:04   20   wife owns and operates a retail floral business here in

09:25:07   21   Marshall.

09:25:07   22            Now, I tell you all these things, because in a few

09:25:11   23   minutes, I'm going to ask each of you to tell me the same

09:25:14   24   type of information about yourselves, and I think you're

09:25:17   25   entitled to know as much about me as I'm about to find out

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 4 of 125 PageID #: 18340
                                                                                       4



09:25:21    1   about each of you.

09:25:22    2              We are about to engage in the selection of a jury

09:25:26    3   in a civil case involving allegations of patent

09:25:30    4   infringement.

09:25:33    5              However, before we go any further, I'd like to

09:25:35    6   mention some of the health and safety precautions that

09:25:39    7   we're going to be taking during this trial.

09:25:41    8              Each of you should have received a letter signed

09:25:44    9   by me attached to your summons outlining in a general sense

09:25:51   10   some of the things you could expect from a health and

09:25:53   11   safety standpoint when you arrived at the courthouse this

09:25:56   12   morning.    There are going to be additional safeguards that

09:26:00   13   will be implemented during the trial.

09:26:02   14              As regards the eight of you that will be selected

09:26:05   15   to serve as the jury in this case, and once we begin the

09:26:09   16   trial, each morning during the trial, the members of the

09:26:13   17   jury will have their temperature taken when they enter the

09:26:16   18   courthouse.

09:26:17   19              And each evening after we recess for the day, the

09:26:21   20   jury room, the jury box, and the restrooms that are

09:26:24   21   attached to the jury room will all be specially deep

09:26:27   22   cleaned.

09:26:28   23              Once the jury is selected and seated, we're going

09:26:32   24   to position you in the jury box so that there's a vacant

09:26:36   25   chair between everyone on the jury; that no one is seated

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 5 of 125 PageID #: 18341
                                                                                       5



09:26:39    1   directly next to each other.

09:26:41    2           Also, ladies and gentlemen, once you are selected

09:26:44    3   as a member of the jury and seated, I'm going to ask you to

09:26:50    4   take off your masks and, instead, put on one of these

09:26:55    5   plastic face shields.

09:26:58    6           It's very important throughout the trial process

09:27:01    7   that the lawyers in this case are able to see the faces of

09:27:04    8   the eight members of the jury.       It's important for me to be

09:27:07    9   able to see the eight faces of the members of the jury.

09:27:11   10           It's important for the jury to see the lawyers.

09:27:13   11   And whether they are masked at counsel table or not,

09:27:16   12   whenever they go to the podium to address the Court or the

09:27:19   13   jury, they will remove a mask if they have one.

09:27:23   14           And since I'm more than six feet away from

09:27:25   15   everybody, I've taken my mask off.        It's important for

09:27:28   16   everyone to be able to see everyone through the process,

09:27:31   17   and that's why I'm going to ask the eight members of the

09:27:34   18   jury, once they're selected and seated, to replace their

09:27:37   19   masks with a plastic face shield.

09:27:39   20           Also, those of you that are selected on the jury

09:27:44   21   should know that the Court has ordered the clerk's office

09:27:48   22   to provide separately-boxed lunches every day for the

09:27:53   23   members of the jury, and they'll be brought to you in the

09:27:55   24   jury room.   That way no one will have to leave the

09:27:59   25   courthouse, mix socially in the public for lunch, and then

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 6 of 125 PageID #: 18342
                                                                                       6



09:28:01    1   come back.

09:28:02    2              Also, it has the added benefit of saving us some

09:28:05    3   time in the process so we won't have to take as long a

09:28:08    4   break each day for lunch.

09:28:10    5              Now, these are some of the precautions we're going

09:28:13    6   to be taking.     As I said, there will be more that will come

09:28:17    7   out over the course of the trial, but I wanted to mention

09:28:20    8   these to you in addition to those that I mentioned in my

09:28:24    9   letter that was attached to your summons.

09:28:25   10              All of these are in place so that we can ensure we

09:28:29   11   have not only a fair and an impartial trial, but a safe

09:28:34   12   trial as well.

09:28:35   13              Also, at this time, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd

09:28:38   14   indulge me for a minute, I'd like to review with you how we

09:28:42   15   came to have our American civil jury trial system.

09:28:44   16              If you look back in ancient history, and if you

09:28:48   17   begin with the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old

09:28:52   18   Testament, you'll see that the ancient Hebrew nation

09:28:55   19   empaneled juries to determine questions of property

09:28:59   20   ownership and property value.

09:29:00   21              The ancient Greeks began using a jury system about

09:29:04   22   1500 BC.     The Romans, as they did with many things, copied

09:29:09   23   the jury system from the Greeks.        And it was the Romans

09:29:14   24   that brought the jury system with them in the 4th Century

09:29:19   25   AD when they conquered what is now England and the United

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 7 of 125 PageID #: 18343
                                                                                       7



09:29:24    1   Kingdom.    And that jury system was transported to England

09:29:28    2   in the 4th Century AD.

09:29:31    3              By the 12th Century AD, there had been 800 years

09:29:35    4   of jury trials in England.      But in the 12th Century AD, a

09:29:41    5   tyrannical king came to the throne of England named King

09:29:45    6   John, and King John became embroiled in many different

09:29:48    7   disputes with his nobles that led that country to the brink

09:29:52    8   of a civil war.

09:29:53    9              That civil war, however, was avoided.         One of the

09:29:55   10   disputes between King John and his nobles that led them to

09:30:00   11   the brink of civil war was King John's attempt to restrict

09:30:04   12   and do away with the right to trial by jury in England.

09:30:06   13              As I say, those disputes were resolved not by war

09:30:10   14   but by a written document that King John and all his nobles

09:30:15   15   signed at a place in England called Runnymede.           And the

09:30:20   16   document that was a result of those discussions,

09:30:23   17   resolutions, and settlements that set forth the right to

09:30:25   18   trial by jury in England thereafter is called the Magna

09:30:30   19   Carta.

09:30:31   20              In fact, ladies and gentlemen, as a point of

09:30:35   21   interest, you might be interested to know that there are 28

09:30:38   22   of our American United States -- our states, 28 of them

09:30:41   23   have directly copied the exact language from the Magna

09:30:47   24   Carta addressing the right to trial by jury into their

09:30:50   25   state constitutions.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 8 of 125 PageID #: 18344
                                                                                       8



09:30:51    1           So you can see that the right to trial by jury in

09:30:53    2   civil and in criminal cases was well ingrained in our

09:30:59    3   forefathers when they came to this continent as British

09:31:05    4   colonists.   And the jury system in colonial America thrived

09:31:07    5   and flourished for over a hundred years until another

09:31:10    6   tyrannical king came to the throne of Great Britain.

09:31:14    7           This time his name was King George, the III.             King

09:31:20    8   George, the III, became embroiled with many disputes and

09:31:23    9   conflicts between the throne in England and his British

09:31:30   10   colonists here in America.      Among those disputes was an

09:31:34   11   attempt by King George to, again, limit or do away with the

09:31:39   12   right to trial by jury.

09:31:40   13           As a matter of fact, when Thomas Jefferson wrote

09:31:43   14   the Declaration of Independence, which specifically

09:31:45   15   outlines the various disputes and issues existing between

09:31:48   16   the Crown and the colonies that led to a -- a determination

09:31:53   17   by our forefathers that they needed to break away from and

09:32:00   18   form their own independent country, in the Declaration of

09:32:03   19   Independence, Thomas Jefferson specifically recited the

09:32:06   20   King's attempt to restrict or limit the right to trial by

09:32:09   21   jury as one of the reasons why we needed to leave England

09:32:13   22   and become our own independent nation.

09:32:15   23           In fact, all of you know that that did happen.

09:32:20   24   And after we formed our own independent country as the

09:32:24   25   United States of America, we went through a period of

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 9 of 125 PageID #: 18345
                                                                                        9



09:32:29    1   developing our own governing documents.          And out of that

09:32:33    2   process, came the United States Constitution, the supreme

09:32:36    3   law of the land.

09:32:37    4           And shortly after the Constitution was ratified,

09:32:40    5   there were 10 amendments that everybody voted to ratify the

09:32:45    6   Constitution for, because they'd effectively been promised

09:32:48    7   those 10 amendments would follow shortly thereafter.             And,

09:32:52    8   in fact, those 10 amendments were adopted, those 10

09:32:57    9   amendments you all know as the Bill of Rights.

09:32:59   10           And among the first 10 amendments to the United

09:33:04   11   States Constitution, is the Seventh Amendment.           The Seventh

09:33:08   12   Amendment to our Constitution guarantees the right to every

09:33:11   13   American citizen to resolve their civil disputes before a

09:33:13   14   jury of their peers.

09:33:17   15           So the civil jury system is enshrined and

09:33:19   16   guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment to our Constitution.

09:33:23   17   That and the other nine amendments that form the Bill of

09:33:28   18   Rights were ratified in 1791.

09:33:30   19           So you can see that for over two -- well over 200

09:33:34   20   years, every American citizen has had a guaranteed

09:33:38   21   constitutional right to resolve their disputes through a

09:33:40   22   civil jury trial.

09:33:41   23           I always tell citizens who appear for jury duty,

09:33:46   24   as you have this morning, that, in my personal opinion,

09:33:48   25   jury service is the second highest form of public service

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 10 of 125 PageID #: 18346
                                                                                        10



09:33:51    1   that any citizen can perform.        In my personal view, the

09:33:56    2   highest form of public service are those young men and

09:34:01    3   women that serve in our military.

09:34:03    4            Now, when the lawyers address you this morning,

09:34:06    5   and they'll do that shortly hereafter, they're going to ask

09:34:11    6   various questions.

09:34:11    7            And I want all of you to understand that they will

09:34:14    8   not be trying to pry unduly into your personal affairs.

09:34:18    9   Said another way, ladies and gentlemen, they're not trying

09:34:21   10   to be nosy.   They're trying to obtain relevant information

09:34:27   11   to secure the selection of a fair and impartial jury to

09:34:30   12   hear the evidence and to decide the issues in this case.

09:34:32   13            So please keep that in mind.         They are not trying

09:34:37   14   to pry unduly into any of your personal business, and they

09:34:41   15   are entitled to ask the questions they ask.

09:34:43   16            The important thing for each of you to keep in

09:34:46   17   mind is that your answers to their questions should be

09:34:48   18   full, complete, and truthful.        There are no wrong answers

09:34:53   19   to any question you'll be asked, as long as your response

09:34:56   20   is full, complete, and truthful.

09:34:58   21            I -- I don't know if it will happen today, ladies

09:35:03   22   and gentlemen, it rarely does, but, occasionally, there's a

09:35:06   23   question asked during jury selection that a member of the

09:35:08   24   jury panel finds to be personally so private and so

09:35:14   25   intimate that they're not comfortable answering that

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 11 of 125 PageID #: 18347
                                                                                        11



09:35:16    1   question in front of everybody in the courtroom.            Again,

09:35:19    2   that doesn't happen very often.

09:35:21    3            But if that should happen, you always have the

09:35:24    4   option to say, as an answer, I'd like to talk about that

09:35:28    5   with Judge Gilstrap.      And if that's your answer, I'll

09:35:32    6   provide an opportunity for you to answer the question

09:35:34    7   outside of the presence of everyone else on the panel.

09:35:38    8   But, again, that doesn't come up very often.

09:35:40    9            The trial in this case is going to begin today

09:35:45   10   after the jury is selected, seated, and sworn.            It will go

09:35:49   11   through tomorrow.     And I anticipate -- my best estimate is

09:35:53   12   that it will take all of next week.

09:35:55   13            So today's the 1st of October.         And by my

09:35:59   14   calculations, my best estimate is we should be finished by

09:36:02   15   Friday of next week, which would be the 9th of October.

09:36:06   16            Now, if there are any of you on the panel who

09:36:10   17   could not be here during that period of time, if you were

09:36:13   18   selected, either because you or an immediate member of your

09:36:21   19   family have a surgical procedure that's scheduled that

09:36:24   20   can't be easily rescheduled or you have some other very

09:36:26   21   serious reason why you couldn't be here if you were

09:36:28   22   selected, that's something I need to know about at this

09:36:31   23   time.

09:36:31   24            If any of you fall in that category, please raise

09:36:34   25   your hands and let me make a note of it.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 12 of 125 PageID #: 18348
                                                                                        12



09:36:39    1             I see one hand.

09:36:41    2             Ma'am, would you stand up so I can see your

09:36:44    3   number?   No. 23.    Okay.    Thank you.

09:36:47    4             Anybody -- please have a seat.

09:36:49    5             Anybody else?      One more?   Couple more.

09:36:53    6             23, 31, and 25.      I can see your number.       Thank

09:36:59    7   you.

09:36:59    8             Anybody else?      23, 31, and 25.    Thank you.

09:37:06    9             All right.    I'm going to call for announcements on

09:37:10   10   the record at this time in the case of Vocalife LLC versus

09:37:16   11   Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com LLC.         This is Civil Case

09:37:28   12   No. 2:19-cv-123.

09:37:29   13             And, counsel, if you'll introduce those with you

09:37:32   14   at the counsel table when you give your announcements.

09:37:34   15             What says the Plaintiff?

09:37:42   16             MS. TRUELOVE:      Good morning, Your Honor.       Jennifer

09:37:44   17   Truelove with McKool Smith for Plaintiff, Vocalife.              At

09:37:46   18   counsel table with me today, I have my partner, Mr. Sam

09:37:49   19   Baxter, and I also have Mr. Fred Fabricant from the

09:37:55   20   Fabricant law firm.

09:37:57   21             And we're ready to proceed, Your Honor.

09:37:59   22             THE COURT:    Thank you.

09:37:59   23             What says the Defendants?

09:38:01   24             MR. DACUS:    Good morning, Your Honor.        Deron

09:38:06   25   Dacus, here with Dave Hadden.        And we also have with us

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 13 of 125 PageID #: 18349
                                                                                        13



09:38:17    1   Phil Hilmes from Amazon, Your Honor.         And we're ready to

09:38:17    2   proceed.

09:38:18    3              THE COURT:   Thank you.

09:38:18    4              As I told you, ladies and gentlemen, this is a

09:38:20    5   case -- a civil case arising out of the patent laws of the

09:38:24    6   United States.

09:38:24    7              And what the Plaintiff is claiming is that its

09:38:26    8   patent has been infringed by the Defendants.           And it's

09:38:29    9   seeking money damages because of that alleged infringement.

09:38:35   10              The Defendant denies that it infringes the

09:38:38   11   Plaintiff's patent, and they contend that this particular

09:38:40   12   patent is invalid.

09:38:45   13              Now, what I've just told you is a very shorthand,

09:38:48   14   informal way of describing the case in layman's terms.              And

09:38:48   15   I know you've all seen this morning the patent video

09:38:54   16   prepared by the Federal Judicial Center, so you already

09:38:55   17   know more about patent cases than most people do when they

09:38:58   18   appear in federal court.

09:38:59   19              As I've said, the lawyers for both sides are going

09:39:02   20   to proceed to ask questions of the panel later in the

09:39:05   21   process to gather the information that they need to

09:39:09   22   exercise their strikes, their peremptory challenges, to

09:39:12   23   complete the process of selecting the jurors that will hear

09:39:15   24   the evidence and try this case.

09:39:18   25              Again, there aren't any wrong answers as long as

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 14 of 125 PageID #: 18350
                                                                                        14



09:39:20    1   the answers to their questions that you give are full,

09:39:23    2   complete, and truthful.

09:39:24    3            If any attorney in the case should ask you a

09:39:30    4   question as a part of jury selection this morning, ladies

09:39:32    5   and gentlemen, that I think is improper, I will certainly

09:39:35    6   stop them.   But I don't expect that to happen.           These are

09:39:38    7   very experienced and skilled trial lawyers.           They

09:39:41    8   understand the rules of this court, and they understand the

09:39:48    9   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Evidence.

09:39:50   10   I do not expect that to come up.

09:39:52   11            One thing I do want to call your attention to

09:39:54   12   before the lawyers begin with their questioning is that --

09:39:57   13   is the burden of proof that will be required and applied in

09:40:00   14   this case.

09:40:00   15            In a patent case such as this, the jury may be

09:40:04   16   called upon to apply two different burdens of proof to the

09:40:09   17   evidence that's presented.

09:40:10   18            The jury may apply the burden of proof known as

09:40:14   19   the preponderance of the evidence -- I'll say that again,

09:40:19   20   the preponderance of the evidence -- as well as a second

09:40:22   21   and different burden of proof known as clear and convincing

09:40:24   22   evidence -- clear and convincing evidence.

09:40:32   23            Now, when you're responding to lawyers' questions

09:40:35   24   about the burden of proof, I need to instruct you that when

09:40:37   25   a party has the burden of proof on any claim or defense by

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 15 of 125 PageID #: 18351
                                                                                        15



09:40:42    1   a preponderance of the evidence, it means that you, the

09:40:46    2   jury, must be persuaded by the credible and believable

09:40:50    3   evidence that that claim or defense is more probably true

09:40:54    4   than not true.    I'll say that again, more probably true

09:40:59    5   than not true.

09:41:00    6              Sometimes this is talked about as being the

09:41:04    7   greater weight and degree of credible testimony.

09:41:08    8              Let me give you an example that I hope will be

09:41:12    9   helpful.    I think you can all see in front of me and in

09:41:15   10   front of our court reporter there is a statue of the Lady

09:41:19   11   of Justice.

09:41:19   12              She is blindfolded.     She holds a sword of justice

09:41:23   13   lowered in her right hand.       In her left hand she holds,

09:41:28   14   raised above her, the Scales of Justice.

09:41:30   15              Those scales are balanced and equal -- completely

09:41:34   16   balanced and completely equal.        And that should be where

09:41:37   17   the parties in this case start off at the beginning of this

09:41:40   18   trial, completely equal.

09:41:41   19              Over the course of the trial, each side is going

09:41:44   20   to put on their evidence that they believe benefits them

09:41:48   21   and proves the issues that they contend are true in this

09:41:51   22   case.

09:41:52   23              And when all that evidence is in, the jury that's

09:41:57   24   heard the evidence will retire to the jury room when I

09:42:00   25   instruct them to, and they will deliberate on the verdict.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 16 of 125 PageID #: 18352
                                                                                        16



09:42:04    1            And as a part of that verdict, they're going to

09:42:07    2   answer certain questions.       And in answering a question

09:42:09    3   where one party has the burden of proof, if you think about

09:42:14    4   all the evidence that's been put on either side of those

09:42:17    5   scales, one side for the Plaintiff and one side for the

09:42:19    6   Defendant, considering all the evidence, if those scales

09:42:24    7   should tip in favor of the party who has the burden of

09:42:28    8   proof by a preponderance of the evidence, even if those

09:42:31    9   scales tip ever so slightly, then that party has met their

09:42:36   10   burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.

09:42:38   11            On the other hand, ladies and gentlemen, when a

09:42:45   12   party has the burden of proof on any issue by clear and

09:42:49   13   convincing evidence, that second burden of proof that I

09:42:52   14   mentioned to you, it means that the jury must have an

09:42:55   15   abiding conviction that the truth of the parties' factual

09:43:02   16   contentions are highly probable.        Let me say that again for

09:43:05   17   emphasis.   An abiding conviction that the truth of the

09:43:08   18   parties' factual contentions are highly probable.

09:43:17   19            This second burden of proof, this clear and

09:43:18   20   convincing evidence burden of proof, is a higher burden of

09:43:21   21   proof than the preponderance of the evidence burden of

09:43:23   22   proof.

09:43:23   23            Let's go back to the example I gave you.            If all

09:43:29   24   the evidence in your minds is placed on one side or the

09:43:31   25   other of those scales during this trial, Plaintiff's

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 17 of 125 PageID #: 18353
                                                                                        17



09:43:36    1   evidence on one side, the Defendants' evidence on the

09:43:39    2   other, and a party has the burden of proof by clear and

09:43:42    3   convincing evidence, for that party to meet their burden of

09:43:45    4   proof, those scales must tip in that party's favor, and

09:43:49    5   they must definitely tip in that party's favor.            It's not

09:43:53    6   adequate that they tip ever so slightly.

09:43:56    7            Again, it is a higher burden of proof.           It

09:44:00    8   requires a greater degree of persuasion than the

09:44:02    9   preponderance of the evidence standard.

09:44:04   10            Now, just so there's no confusion, ladies and

09:44:08   11   gentlemen, none of you should think about or consider or

09:44:13   12   apply in this case a third and a very different burden of

09:44:18   13   proof called beyond a reasonable doubt.

09:44:20   14            I'm sure you've all heard of the burden of proof

09:44:24   15   of beyond a reasonable doubt in the media, on television,

09:44:28   16   in movies.   That burden of proof is the burden of proof

09:44:32   17   applied in a criminal case.

09:44:33   18            It has absolutely no application whatsoever in a

09:44:35   19   civil case like this.      You should not confuse the clear and

09:44:40   20   convincing evidence standard -- the clear and convincing

09:44:44   21   evidence standard with beyond a reasonable doubt.              They're

09:44:47   22   not the same thing.

09:44:50   23            The clear and convincing evidence standard is not

09:44:52   24   as high as beyond a reasonable doubt, but it is higher than

09:44:56   25   the preponderance of the evidence.

                                                                                        18



09:44:58    1            I give you these instructions in case during their

09:45:02    2   questioning the lawyers for either or both sides ask you

09:45:05    3   about your ability to fairly apply both of those burdens of

09:45:10    4   proof to the evidence if you're selected to serve on this

09:45:13    5   jury.

09:45:13    6            Now, before we go any further, this is the point

09:45:16    7   in the process where I'm going to learn as much about you

09:45:19    8   as I told you about me when I first sat down.

09:45:22    9            We're going to go through nine separate questions

09:45:25   10   that are on the monitors in front of you and should be in

09:45:29   11   laminated copies for you to look at.

09:45:33   12            Here's how we're going to do this, ladies and

09:45:35   13   gentlemen:     We have two Court Security Officers with us

09:45:38   14   this morning.     They're both going to be in the gallery.

09:45:41   15   They're both going to have two sanitized handheld

09:45:45   16   microphones.

09:45:46   17            When it's your turn to answer these questions,

09:45:48   18   they will hand you one of these microphones.           I'm going to

09:45:52   19   ask you at that point to stand, to take off or lower your

09:45:56   20   masks so we can see your smiling face, and give us your

09:45:59   21   answers to these nine questions.

09:46:02   22            Once you've finished, you'll hand the microphone

09:46:04   23   back to the Court Security Officer, replace your mask, and

09:46:06   24   have a seat.

09:46:08   25            Also, ladies and gentlemen, later in the process,

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 19 of 125 PageID #: 18355
                                                                                        19



09:46:10    1   the lawyers are going to be able to pose specific questions

09:46:14    2   to individual members of the panel.

09:46:16    3            If you're asked a specific question by one of the

09:46:19    4   lawyers in the case, you should follow the very same

09:46:23    5   procedure in giving your answer.        You should wait until the

09:46:26    6   Court Security Officer hands you a handheld microphone.

09:46:30    7   You should stand, you should take off your mask, give your

09:46:34    8   answer, replace your mask, hand the microphone back to the

09:46:38    9   Court Security Officer, and have a seat.

09:46:40   10            Please do it that way.        We are in a very large

09:46:43   11   courtroom.     There are a lot of people here.        Especially

09:46:45   12   those of you in the back of the panel are a long way from

09:46:48   13   me, from the Court staff, and from the lawyers.            It's very

09:46:53   14   important that you just follow these instructions.             Use

09:46:56   15   that handheld microphone.       Hold it close enough to your

09:46:58   16   mouth so that it makes a difference, and let us hear from

09:47:02   17   you in that manner.

09:47:05   18            As I say, we have two of these handheld

09:47:07   19   microphones.     And after each juror uses one, when it's

09:47:10   20   handed back to the Court Security Officers, they're going

09:47:13   21   to sanitize it, use the other clean microphone in the

09:47:15   22   meantime, and this process will rotate so that none of you

09:47:19   23   are handed a microphone that hasn't been immediately

09:47:23   24   sanitized before it's used.

09:47:25   25            All right.     With those instructions, we'll begin

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 20 of 125 PageID #: 18356
                                                                                        20



09:47:27    1   with Panel Member No. 1, Ms. Banks.

09:47:31    2              As soon as you get a microphone, if you would

09:47:33    3   stand and hand -- and answer for us those nine questions,

09:47:38    4   please, ma'am.

09:47:38    5              JUROR BANKS:     My name is Ellen Banks.      I live in

09:48:30   15   in Camp County, Texas.       I think that's all the questions.

09:48:36   16              THE COURT:     How long ago was that, ma'am?

09:48:39   17              JUROR BANKS:     It's been at least 10 years.

09:48:40   18              THE COURT:     All right.    Thank you very much,

09:48:42   19   Ms. Banks.     If you'll have a seat, please.

10:15:42    1            THE COURT:     Thank you, ma'am.

10:15:43    2            Next is No. 40, Mr. Ragsdale.

10:15:47    3            JUROR RAGSDALE:        Ronnie Ragsdale.    I live in

10:15:51    4   Daingerfield.    I work for Morris County.         Worked there

10:15:55    5   about nearly 11 or 12 years.        High school education.

10:16:13    9            MR. RAGSDALE:     Operator.

10:16:13   10            THE COURT:     Road and bridge department?

10:16:16   11            JUROR RAGSDALE:        Pardon me?

10:16:16   12            THE COURT:     Road and bridge?

10:16:16   13            JUROR RAGSDALE:        Yes, sir.

10:16:17   14            THE COURT:     Okay.     Thank you very much.

10:16:17   15            All right.     Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very

10:16:23   16   much.

10:16:23   17            Now, I need to say a couple things to you before I

10:16:27   18   turn the questioning over to the lawyers.

10:16:29   19            The jurors that are actually selected to serve in

10:16:33   20   this case will serve in the role as the judges of the

10:16:38   21   facts, and the jurors selected to serve here will make the

10:16:40   22   sole determination about what the facts are in this case.

10:16:46   23            Now, my job, as the Judge, is to rule on questions

10:16:49   24   of law, evidence, procedure, maintain the decorum of the

10:16:53   25   courtroom, and to oversee the efficient flow of the

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 43 of 125 PageID #: 18379
                                                                                        43



10:16:55    1   evidence during the course of the trial.

10:16:56    2            Also, I want to say a couple things to you about

10:17:00    3   our judicial system that I hope will put things in a proper

10:17:04    4   perspective for you.

10:17:05    5            In every civil jury trial like this one, besides

10:17:10    6   the parties themselves, there are always three

10:17:13    7   participants, the jury, the judge, and the lawyers.

10:17:17    8            With regard to the lawyers, I think it's important

10:17:19    9   for each of you to understand that our judicial system is

10:17:24   10   an adversary system, which simply means that during the

10:17:28   11   trial, each of the parties will seek to present their

10:17:31   12   respective cases to the jury through their counsel in the

10:17:34   13   very best light possible.

10:17:36   14            Now, it's no surprise to any of you that lawyers

10:17:40   15   are sometimes criticized in the public and in the media,

10:17:43   16   but the Court's observed that at least some of that

10:17:47   17   criticism is the result of a basic misunderstanding of our

10:17:52   18   adversary system in which the lawyers act as advocates for

10:17:56   19   the competing parties.

10:17:59   20            And as an advocate, a lawyer is ethically and

10:18:02   21   legally obligated to zealously assert his or her client's

10:18:06   22   positions under the rules of our adversary system.             And by

10:18:11   23   presenting the best case possible on behalf of their

10:18:15   24   clients, the lawyers hopefully will enable the jury to

10:18:18   25   better weigh the relevant evidence, to determine the truth,

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 44 of 125 PageID #: 18380
                                                                                        44



10:18:20    1   and to arrive at a just verdict based on that evidence.

10:18:23    2            This adversary system of justice has served our

10:18:28    3   country well, for over 200 years.         And America's lawyers

10:18:32    4   have been, are now, and will be in the future an

10:18:34    5   indispensable part of that process.

10:18:36    6            So as we go forward with the trial, even though

10:18:40    7   it's possible I might occasionally frown or grumble at the

10:18:47    8   lawyers, I'm simply trying to make sure that their advocacy

10:18:51    9   doesn't get outside the boundaries of our adversary system

10:18:54   10   and our Rules of Procedure.

10:18:55   11            But keep in mind, ladies and gentlemen, those of

10:18:59   12   you that are selected to serve on the jury, that the

10:19:00   13   lawyers are just doing their jobs, and I think it's

10:19:02   14   important for you to be aware of that as we go forward.

10:19:05   15            Also, ladies and gentlemen, for those of you that

10:19:08   16   are selected to serve on this jury, during the course of

10:19:10   17   the trial, I am going to do my very best to make sure that

10:19:13   18   none of you have any idea about how I feel about the

10:19:18   19   evidence in this case, because it's the jury's job and not

10:19:22   20   mine to determine what the facts are from the evidence

10:19:26   21   that's presented.

10:19:27   22            And those of you selected on the jury should not

10:19:29   23   take any expression that you see or you think you see or

10:19:33   24   anything that you think you see as coming from me, as a

10:19:36   25   factor to consider in determining what the ultimate facts

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 45 of 125 PageID #: 18381
                                                                                        45



10:19:39    1   are in this case.

10:19:40    2              All right.   At this time, counsel will address the

10:19:47    3   jury.

10:19:47    4              Ms. Truelove, you may address the jury on behalf

10:19:50    5   of -- the panel on behalf of Plaintiff.          Would you like a

10:19:54    6   warning on your time?

10:19:55    7              MS. TRUELOVE:   I would, Your Honor.        If you would

10:19:57    8   tell me five minutes left and a minute left.

10:20:00    9              THE COURT:   I will do that.

10:20:01   10              MS. TRUELOVE:   Thank you.

10:20:08   11              THE COURT:   Please proceed when you're ready.

10:20:10   12              MS. TRUELOVE:   Thank you, Your Honor.

10:20:10   13              May it please the Court.

10:20:13   14              Mr. Dacus, Mr. Hilmes, Mr. Hadden.

10:20:20   15              Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.         I want to

10:20:21   16   begin first by just saying thank you.          Thank you for

10:20:23   17   showing up today.

10:20:26   18              In ordinary times, it's -- it's still remarkable

10:20:28   19   to have folks show up for jury service for such an

10:20:32   20   important thing.     And in these times, it's even more

10:20:35   21   remarkable to have you here.       And on behalf of myself,

10:20:39   22   Mr. Baxter, Mr. Fabricant, our client Vocalife, and

10:20:44   23   Vocalife's owner Dr. Li, we thank you for your time this

10:20:48   24   morning.

10:20:48   25              I'll begin, just as His Honor began, and tell you

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 46 of 125 PageID #: 18382
                                                                                        46



10:20:52    1   about myself.

10:20:53    2            As you heard, my name is Jennifer Truelove.             I

10:20:55    3   live here in Marshall, Texas.        I have ever since I

10:20:59    4   graduated law school back in 1999.         I met my husband Kurt

10:21:04    5   there, and he is a Marshall boy, so he brought me back

10:21:04    6   here.   And we've both been practicing law since that time.

10:21:08    7            I've been at McKool Smith for the last 10 years,

10:21:10    8   where I've had the honor of working with Sam Baxter here in

10:21:15    9   Marshall and trying these interesting and exciting patent

10:21:18   10   cases that you're going to get to hear about.

10:21:20   11            Kurt and I have three children.          Our oldest

10:21:20   12   daughter, Cate, is a freshman at UT where we are paying for

10:21:25   13   her to sit in her dorm room and take classes, virtually.

10:21:28   14   Our daughter, Maggie, is a junior at Marshall High School.

10:21:31   15   And our son, Walt, is in 8th grade at the junior high here

10:21:37   16   in Marshall.

10:21:37   17            I have actually sat on a criminal jury before up

10:21:40   18   in Jefferson when we lived up there in Marion County.                And

10:21:44   19   so that's -- that's me.

10:21:46   20            Before we get to asking questions, I thought I

10:21:49   21   would take just a minute to give you a little bit of an

10:21:52   22   overview of what this case is about, to kind of put it in

10:21:55   23   context for you.

10:21:56   24            Vocalife is a company.        They make products.

10:22:02   25   They're in Plano, Texas.      And Dr. Li is the owner.         And you

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 47 of 125 PageID #: 18383
                                                                                        47



10:22:05    1   all know now, we have this technology where you can stand

10:22:11    2   in the middle of your house and speak, and you can turn

10:22:15    3   your thermostat up, you can turn your lights out, you can

10:22:21    4   turn your radio on, all by the sound of your voice, talking

10:22:23    5   to a computer.    In this case, we're going to be talking

10:22:27    6   about Amazon's Echo.

10:22:28    7            But that wasn't the case back in the 2000s.             Back

10:22:34    8   in the 2007 time frame, what you're going -- what you're

10:22:37    9   going to understand is we couldn't do that.            We didn't have

10:22:41   10   the technology to do that, and Dr. Li was very involved in

10:22:44   11   that kind of microphone technology.         Right?

10:22:47   12            And at that point in time, you could talk directly

10:22:49   13   into a microphone, and it could identify your voice, but

10:22:52   14   you couldn't -- you couldn't be in the middle of a room and

10:22:55   15   do the things that you can do now.

10:22:56   16            And so he recognized that problem.           He recognized

10:22:59   17   that that's where the future was going and technology was

10:23:01   18   going, and he set out to find a solution.            And he very

10:23:05   19   wisely hired a Dr. Manli Zhu, and she and he set about

10:23:12   20   coming up with a solution to the problem.

10:23:14   21            And, ultimately, what they -- what they did is

10:23:16   22   they took some things that were out there, technology-wise,

10:23:19   23   they took something called adaptive beamforming, another

10:23:23   24   thing called sound source localization, and another thing

10:23:29   25   called noise cancellization.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 48 of 125 PageID #: 18384
                                                                                        48



10:23:31    1             And they spent years, trial and error, coming up

10:23:35    2   with an algorithm, right, something -- a very detailed plan

10:23:38    3   on putting these things together, and they figured out a

10:23:41    4   way to make it work, to solve the problem, where you can

10:23:44    5   stand in a room and do those kinds of things by talking to

10:23:48    6   a device.

10:23:48    7             They put that in a chip.       This was a very novel

10:23:48    8   and new way to do things.

10:23:51    9             And they actually got an award for it in 2011, and

10:23:56   10   Amazon invited them to come to their lab and talk to them

10:23:59   11   about this technology.

10:24:01   12             And they did something, they signed an NDA, and

10:24:04   13   you heard -- we heard that word mentioned just a moment

10:24:07   14   ago.   And they shared their technology.         And lo and behold,

10:24:10   15   three years later the Echo comes out, and they're invited

10:24:14   16   again by Amazon to come to a launch party to see this new

10:24:17   17   device.     So that's kind of why we're here.

10:24:19   18             Those of you that are selected are going to hear a

10:24:23   19   lot more about the patent in this case that Dr. Li and

10:24:27   20   Dr. Zhu are inventors on, and you're going to hear a lot

10:24:32   21   more about the technology and why it is that Vocalife

10:24:34   22   thinks Amazon infringes.

10:24:42   23             So I know that a couple of you, just from your

10:24:45   24   questionnaires, have an Echo product.

10:24:51   25             I think you do, Ms. Edwards, is that right,

10:24:55    1   Juror 5?

10:24:55    2              JUROR EDWARDS:    Yes, ma'am.

10:24:57    3              MS. TRUELOVE:    Sorry, I'm going to put you guys to

10:24:59    4   work.

10:24:59    5              THE COURT:   And this is where I'm going to ask

10:24:59    6   everybody to wait until the microphone gets there.             Do it

10:25:01    7   like we've been doing it.

10:25:01    8              JUROR EDWARDS:    Yes.

10:25:02    9              MS. TRUELOVE:    You have an Echo Dot; is that

10:25:04   10   right?

10:25:04   11              JUROR EDWARDS:    Yes.

10:25:04   12              MS. TRUELOVE:    How long have you had that?

10:25:05   13              JUROR EDWARDS:    Just a couple months.

10:25:07   14              MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.   Are you enjoying it?

10:25:08   15              JUROR EDWARDS:    Yeah, it wakes me up in the

10:25:10   16   morning.

10:25:10   17              MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.   Have you noticed that --

10:25:13   18   does it have lights that go around it when you speak to it?

10:25:16   19              JUROR EDWARDS:    Yes.

10:25:16   20              MS. TRUELOVE:    Have you noticed that when you're

10:25:18   21   speaking to it, maybe one particular light will light up?

10:25:21   22              JUROR EDWARDS:    Like there's a blue light that

10:25:23   23   comes on when you're talking to it.

10:25:25   24              MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.   Anything about the fact that

10:25:27   25   you have this product and you like it, going to kind of put

                                                                                        50



10:25:30    1   me a little behind in the game?

10:25:33    2            JUROR EDWARDS:      I wouldn't think so.

10:25:34    3            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.     You can still sit there and

10:25:36    4   listen to the evidence and be -- be fair to my client,

10:25:40    5   Vocalife, even though you have this Amazon product in your

10:25:42    6   home?

10:25:43    7            JUROR EDWARDS:      Yes, ma'am.

10:25:44    8            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.     Thank you very much.

10:25:45    9            And I think -- is it Ms. Bowen, am I saying that

10:25:49   10   right, Juror No. 18?

10:25:54   11            JUROR BOWEN:     It's Bowen.

10:25:55   12            MS. TRUELOVE:     Bowen, thank you.       Ms. Bowen, you

10:25:57   13   have an Echo, right?

10:25:58   14            JUROR BOWEN:     Yes.

10:25:59   15            MS. TRUELOVE:     How long --

10:26:00   16            THE COURT:     Ms. Bowen, would you pull your mask

10:26:02   17   down so we can see you?

10:26:04   18            JUROR BOWEN:     Oh, I'm sorry.

10:26:05   19            THE COURT:     Thank you.

10:26:05   20            JUROR BOWEN:     Yes.     We've had our Echo a year.

10:26:09   21            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.     And do you like it?

10:26:10   22            JUROR BOWEN:     Yes.

10:26:11   23            MS. TRUELOVE:     Is it able to do things for you

10:26:12   24   like turn off the lights and turn on music?

10:26:16   25            JUROR BOWEN:     It could.     We don't utilize it for

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 51 of 125 PageID #: 18387
                                                                                        51



10:26:19    1   that.

10:26:19    2              MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.   What do you use it for?

10:26:21    3              JUROR BOWEN:    The kids like to play the trivia

10:26:23    4   games and, you know, we get weather and alarms and stuff

10:26:26    5   from it.

10:26:27    6              MS. TRUELOVE:    Have you noticed the lights like

10:26:29    7   Juror No. 5, Ms. Edwards, mentioned?

10:26:32    8              JUROR BOWEN:    Yes.

10:26:33    9              MS. TRUELOVE:    And does it light up when it

10:26:35   10   detects your voice?

10:26:37   11              JUROR BOWEN:    Yes.

10:26:37   12              MS. TRUELOVE:    Anything about the fact that you

10:26:39   13   have this product in your home going to be a problem for me

10:26:42   14   as Vocalife's attorney suing Amazon, going forward in this

10:26:46   15   case?

10:26:46   16              JUROR BOWEN:    No.

10:26:47   17              MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.   Thank you, Ms. Bowen.

10:26:48   18              And I think, is it Ms. Wexler, way back there,

10:26:52   19   Juror 35?    You have an Alexa, right?

10:26:54   20              JUROR WEXLER:    Yes, ma'am, I do.

10:26:58   21              MS. TRUELOVE:    And -- and, you know, this is good

10:27:00   22   news for you, there's probably not a very strong likelihood

10:27:04   23   that we're going to get all the way back to you folks in

10:27:08   24   the back of the room.      So I'll just ask, you know, if you

10:27:09   25   were selected, anything about owning that Amazon product

                                                                                        52



10:27:12    1   going to be a problem for me, going forward in this case?

10:27:15    2            JUROR WEXLER:     No, ma'am.

10:27:15    3            MS. TRUELOVE:     All right.     Thank you very much.

10:27:16    4            Anybody else, just looking at the questionnaires,

10:27:19    5   those are the three people that I saw that had products.

10:27:22    6            Anybody else have an Echo product in your home?                A

10:27:24    7   couple people do.

10:27:26    8            Juror No. 3, Mr. Wallace?

10:27:30    9            JUROR WALLACE:      I didn't know it was an Amazon

10:27:34   10   product until you mentioned Alexa.         It was a gift at

10:27:37   11   Christmas, and -- and it helps me listen to music I want to

10:27:41   12   listen to, so...

10:27:42   13            MS. TRUELOVE:     Great.

10:27:43   14            JUROR WALLACE:      No, it wouldn't affect my -- my --

10:27:46   15   put you behind the line or anything like that.

10:27:48   16            MS. TRUELOVE:     Right.    Well, let me -- while I've

10:27:49   17   got you standing there so we don't have to do the

10:27:50   18   microphone shuffle.

10:27:51   19            JUROR WALLACE:      Okay.

10:27:52   20            MS. TRUELOVE:     You're from Gilmer county, you're

10:27:54   21   an attorney, right?

10:27:55   22            JUROR WALLACE:      Yes.

10:27:56   23            MS. TRUELOVE:     And we have that in common, I used

10:27:57   24   to prosecute and do the CPS cases for Harrison County.

10:28:00   25            JUROR WALLACE:      Very good.

10:28:01    1              MS. TRUELOVE:    And do you know Judge Lauren Parish

10:28:04    2   up there in Upshur?

10:28:06    3              JUROR WALLACE:    Very well, yes.

10:28:07    4              MS. TRUELOVE:    And "very well," do you have a nice

10:28:08    5   relationship with her?

10:28:09    6              JUROR WALLACE:    I do.    It's -- social relationship

10:28:12    7   outside the courtroom, professional.         She's one of my dear

10:28:16    8   friends.

10:28:16    9              MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.    So I'm sure you're aware

10:28:18   10   that she married Mr. Baxter?

10:28:20   11              JUROR WALLACE:    Yes, I am.     I thought I recognized

10:28:22   12   Mr. Baxter when he came in.

10:28:23   13              MS. TRUELOVE:    All right.    And that's what I

10:28:24   14   really want to know, is that a problem?          I understand that

10:28:24   15   you and Judge Parish get along well, the fact that she's

10:28:27   16   married to Mr. Baxter?

10:28:28   17              JUROR WALLACE:    She'd be very disappointed in our

10:28:32   18   friendship if that was a problem.         It's not going to be a

10:28:34   19   problem.

10:28:34   20              MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.    I appreciate that.      Thank

10:28:35   21   you very much.    Oh, and one more question since you're

10:28:37   22   standing, I noticed that one of your co-workers is on our

10:28:40   23   panel, it's Ms. Stansbury, right?

10:28:43   24              JUROR WALLACE:    That's correct, yes, we're very

10:28:45   25   proud of her.

10:28:46    1             MS. TRUELOVE:    I imagine.     So anything -- you

10:28:48    2   know, if by off chance you're both selected to sit on this

10:28:51    3   panel, anything about that situation give you pause?

10:28:54    4             JUROR WALLACE:     No, ma'am, we work very well

10:28:56    5   together.

10:28:57    6             MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.    Great.    I appreciate it.

10:28:58    7   Thank you.

10:28:59    8             JUROR WALLACE:     Thank you.

10:28:59    9             MS. TRUELOVE:    And -- and could I ask

10:29:01   10   Ms. Stansbury, that's Juror 13?

10:29:06   11             Good morning.    Just -- just the same question, if

10:29:11   12   you -- if you were selected to sit on the jury with your

10:29:15   13   co-worker here Mr. Wallace, would that be a problem for you

10:29:18   14   at all?

10:29:18   15             JUROR STANSBURY:     No, ma'am.

10:29:19   16             MS. TRUELOVE:    You'd still be able to make up your

10:29:22   17   own mind and -- and decide the case based on your own

10:29:25   18   thoughts and ideas, as opposed to your co-worker's?

10:29:29   19             JUROR STANSBURY:     Yes, ma'am.

10:29:29   20             MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.    I appreciate that.       Thank

10:29:31   21   you very much.

10:29:31   22             So during the quarantine, back -- back to Amazon,

10:29:37   23   if you -- if your house is anything like my house, about

10:29:40   24   every other day you were getting an Amazon package show up

10:29:43   25   at the door.     And -- and it was a good thing, right,

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 55 of 125 PageID #: 18391
                                                                                        55



10:29:46    1   because of the circumstances we were in.

10:29:48    2             Just raise your hand if you've ever ordered

10:29:51    3   anything on Amazon?     It's the majority of the people in the

10:29:55    4   room.

10:29:55    5             Anything about that going to be a problem?           You

10:29:59    6   know, anybody sitting there thinking, it's a great company,

10:30:02    7   they provide a great service, there's just no way that they

10:30:07    8   could do the things that Vocalife is saying in regards to

10:30:13    9   infringing the patent?      Is there anybody that just right

10:30:15   10   now feels that way?     Okay.    I appreciate that.       Thank you.

10:30:18   11             Let's see, I think Juror No. 4, Mr. Miller.

10:30:31   12             JUROR MILLER:    Yes, ma'am.

10:30:32   13             MS. TRUELOVE:    Let me talk to you for just a

10:30:34   14   minute.   You work at Eastman, right?

10:30:37   15             JUROR MILLER:    Yes, ma'am.

10:30:39   16             MS. TRUELOVE:    Do you -- do you know if your

10:30:41   17   company has any intellectual property?

10:30:42   18             JUROR MILLER:    I'm sure we do.

10:30:43   19             MS. TRUELOVE:    Yeah.    I mean, Eastman deals with

10:30:46   20   lots of proprietary things, right?

10:30:48   21             JUROR MILLER:    Yes, ma'am.

10:30:49   22             MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.    What -- what would Eastman

10:30:51   23   do if they found out that somebody was using some of their

10:30:56   24   intellectual property or proprietary information without

10:30:59   25   their permission?

10:31:00    1            JUROR MILLER:     I'm sure they would try to work out

10:31:02    2   a deal or go after them in court.

10:31:04    3            MS. TRUELOVE:     If they couldn't work out a deal,

10:31:06    4   if they approached them or talked to them and couldn't work

10:31:09    5   out a deal, do you think it's all right to take someone to

10:31:14    6   court?

10:31:14    7            JUROR MILLER:     Yes, ma'am.      That would be the next

10:31:16    8   step, I believe.

10:31:17    9            MS. TRUELOVE:     And there at Eastman, have you ever

10:31:18   10   been in a situation where you've had to sign an NDA, or a

10:31:22   11   non-disclosure agreement?

10:31:23   12            JUROR MILLER:     Yes.

10:31:23   13            MS. TRUELOVE:     And -- and what is that?         Can you

10:31:25   14   just tell everyone what that is?

10:31:27   15            JUROR MILLER:     It would be a -- you can't expose

10:31:32   16   company information to other companies --

10:31:35   17            MS. TRUELOVE:     You got to keep it -- you got to

10:31:37   18   keep it private, right?

10:31:39   19            JUROR MILLER:     Yes, ma'am.

10:31:40   20            MS. TRUELOVE:     If you're -- if you're provided

10:31:42   21   some proprietary information or an idea of an invention or

10:31:46   22   something like that, you can't go tell somebody else?

10:31:49   23            JUROR MILLER:     Correct.

10:31:50   24            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    What -- what would you think

10:31:52   25   if you were in a meeting and both sides signed an NDA and

                                                                                        57



10:31:58    1   you're there to tell them about your invention or your

10:32:03    2   idea, you talk about it, and -- and you found out some time

10:32:07    3   later that they went and took your idea and put it in a

10:32:11    4   product?     That be the right thing to do?

10:32:17    5              JUROR MILLER:   No, I wouldn't believe -- I'd

10:32:20    6   probably feel undercut.

10:32:22    7              MS. TRUELOVE:   And if -- if your only recourse,

10:32:24    8   then, was to take that person to court for using your

10:32:27    9   invention, would you be all right with that?

10:32:30   10              JUROR MILLER:   Yes, ma'am.

10:32:30   11              MS. TRUELOVE:   Okay.    Thank you very much.

10:32:31   12              I think -- is it Juror 8 -- 16, rather,

10:32:39   13   Mr. Stephenson?     If I could speak with you for just a

10:32:46   14   minute.

10:32:46   15              And -- and you actually mentioned the word "NDA,"

10:32:49   16   which is why I'm picking on you, when -- when Judge was

10:32:52   17   talking to you earlier.

10:32:53   18              What -- what do you think about that?         If -- if

10:32:56   19   two parties entered into an NDA and they shared ideas with

10:33:00   20   each other and then one party went off and -- and took that

10:33:03   21   idea and put it in a product?        You don't really have any

10:33:09   22   sharp feelings about that?

10:33:11   23              JUROR STEPHENSON:    It's one of those -- it's one

10:33:12   24   of those things.     I don't know the situation or anything

10:33:14   25   like that.

10:33:15    1            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.     You said you had been at

10:33:16    2   your job for about three weeks?

10:33:19    3            JUROR STEPHENSON:      Uh-huh.

10:33:19    4            MS. TRUELOVE:     Is there anything about serving on

10:33:22    5   this jury cause a problem with you since you're just newly

10:33:25    6   at that job?

10:33:26    7            JUROR STEPHENSON:      Missing work.

10:33:28    8            MS. TRUELOVE:     Right.     Is -- is that going to

10:33:30    9   prevent you from being able to -- to focus on the issues

10:33:32   10   that are being discussed from the witnesses?

10:33:34   11            JUROR STEPHENSON:      No, I don't -- I don't think

10:33:36   12   so.

10:33:37   13            THE COURT:     Mr. Stephenson, would you hold that

10:33:40   14   mic a little closer?      I can barely hear you.

10:33:44   15            JUROR STEPHENSON:      I'm sorry.

10:33:45   16            THE COURT:     Thank you.

10:33:46   17            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.     Thank you very much.

10:33:47   18            Some of you made comments in your questionnaires

10:33:51   19   regarding lawsuits.     You were asked a question in there and

10:33:54   20   what your opinions were on lawsuits.         And a couple of you

10:33:56   21   said things -- you think there's too many frivolous or

10:34:01   22   people file too many lawsuits.

10:34:03   23            Anybody feel that way sitting here today?

10:34:07   24            And -- and that's Juror No. --

10:34:07   25            JUROR EVERS:     9.

                                                                                        59



10:34:12    1            MS. TRUELOVE:     -- 9, Mr. Evers, right?        Let's chat

10:34:15    2   for a moment if you don't mind.

10:34:17    3            JUROR EVERS:     Yes, ma'am.

10:34:18    4            MS. TRUELOVE:     You -- you think there's too many

10:34:19    5   lawsuits?

10:34:20    6            JUROR EVERS:     In some cases, yes, ma'am.         Some

10:34:22    7   people are just going out for a quick payday.

10:34:24    8            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    And --

10:34:25    9            JUROR EVERS:     There are cases, though, where it is

10:34:28   10   necessary, though.

10:34:29   11            MS. TRUELOVE:     And -- and so if -- if someone has

10:34:31   12   done what they can to try and resolve a situation and it

10:34:34   13   turns out that their only recourse is to come to court, you

10:34:39   14   don't have a problem with that, do you?

10:34:41   15            JUROR EVERS:     No, ma'am, I do not.

10:34:42   16            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    I think, Mr. Hirt, Juror

10:34:50   17   No. 7, you said, I think, they're a necessary evil to

10:34:59   18   correct a wrong.

10:35:01   19            JUROR HIRT:     That's correct.

10:35:01   20            MS. TRUELOVE:     All right.     And what do you mean by

10:35:03   21   that?

10:35:04   22            JUROR HIRT:     Well, when you can't resolve it

10:35:06   23   across the table and it gets to the point where neither

10:35:09   24   party can make amends, then you have to come to court and

10:35:13   25   try to plead your case to right the wrong that both sides

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 60 of 125 PageID #: 18396
                                                                                        60



10:35:19    1   feel there is.

10:35:19    2            MS. TRUELOVE:     And so you're okay with -- with

10:35:22    3   folks engaging in that process and using the jury system to

10:35:25    4   resolve a dispute?

10:35:27    5            JUROR HIRT:     Correct.

10:35:27    6            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    And I noticed that also in

10:35:30    7   your questionnaire, you had indicated that you had been

10:35:33    8   involved with the -- in a trial as a consultant?

10:35:35    9            JUROR HIRT:     That was years ago.       As a forestry

10:35:40   10   consultant at the time.      And so there was a trespass on a

10:35:44   11   timber sale, and so I basically evaluated the timber that

10:35:49   12   was cut in the wrong and put a value to it for the Court.

10:35:54   13            MS. TRUELOVE:     And did you have to testify?

10:35:56   14            JUROR HIRT:     They settled at the last minute.

10:35:57   15            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.

10:35:58   16            JUROR HIRT:     Probably 15 minutes before I was

10:36:01   17   supposed to take the chair, all of a sudden they came out

10:36:03   18   and said, well, y'all can go home.

10:36:05   19            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    Well, that worked out well

10:36:07   20   for you, then?

10:36:08   21            JUROR HIRT:     Yes, it did.

10:36:09   22            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    Great.    Thank you.     Thank

10:36:11   23   you, Mr. Hirt.    I appreciate that.

10:36:13   24            Anybody -- anybody else have feelings about

10:36:18   25   lawsuits that -- that potentially would prejudice my

                                                                                        61



10:36:20    1   client, Dr. Li?    You don't think folks should be able to

10:36:25    2   show up in court to resolve their disputes?           Anybody feel

10:36:30    3   that way?

10:36:31    4             I want to talk a minute about the inventors in

10:36:33    5   this case, Dr. Li, and you -- you'll see him, if you get

10:36:36    6   selected to sit on this jury.        He'll be at counsel table

10:36:39    7   throughout the course of the trial, and you'll hear from

10:36:41    8   him.

10:36:41    9             And you'll also hear from Dr. Zhu.         She, as the

10:36:44   10   co-inventor on the '049 patent -- that's the patent we're

10:36:47   11   going to be talking about in this case, and so you'll hear

10:36:50   12   from her, as well.

10:36:51   13             Both Dr. Li and Dr. Zhu are from China.           They both

10:36:57   14   were born there.     They both went to school there.          In fact,

10:37:02   15   Dr. Zhu got her Bachelor's and Master's in China.             Dr. Li

10:37:06   16   got his Bachelor's, and then he came to the U.S. and got

10:37:10   17   his Master's in Boston and his Ph.D. also up north.             And

10:37:16   18   Dr. Zhu came here, and she went to Ohio State University

10:37:21   19   where she got her Ph.D. in electrical engineering.

10:37:21   20             And I tell you all of this because being natives

10:37:25   21   of China, even though they are now both U.S. citizens, they

10:37:26   22   have very strong accents.       It's like when I go to try cases

10:37:31   23   up in New York City, they don't always understand what I'm

10:37:34   24   saying.

10:37:35   25             And so my first question is really, is that going

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 62 of 125 PageID #: 18398
                                                                                        62



10:37:38    1   to be a problem for anyone?        You feel like you would have

10:37:43    2   problems really focusing in and paying attention to what

10:37:46    3   these two inventors are going to have to say.            Does anybody

10:37:50    4   feel that way or has that concern?         Good.

10:37:54    5            Oh, I see a hand.      That's Juror No. 27.        Is that

10:38:05    6   Mr. Gardner?    Yes.

10:38:08    7            JUROR GARDNER:      It's been five years, but I

10:38:10    8   have -- I wear hearing aids, and it's -- I struggle a

10:38:13    9   little bit more with hearing than most people.

10:38:15   10            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    Thank you.     And that --

10:38:17   11   that's very helpful information.        I appreciate that.

10:38:19   12            The -- the next question I want to ask is -- just

10:38:24   13   kind of has to do with the political climate right now.

10:38:30   14   We're coming up on an election, and there's a lot of things

10:38:33   15   that have been politicized, particularly about China.

10:38:37   16            And so I just feel obligated to ask whether

10:38:40   17   anybody has strong feelings about just China in general

10:38:44   18   that could potentially bleed over onto our clients, our

10:38:48   19   inventors in this case?      Anybody feel that way?

10:38:51   20            And if it's not something you want to talk about

10:38:55   21   in front of your 39 new best friends, that's fine.             We can

10:38:58   22   always talk to the Court after.        But I don't see any hands.

10:39:02   23   So I appreciate that, as well.

10:39:03   24            Mr. Jenkins, where are you?         Towards the back, I

10:39:08   25   think.   There you are.

10:39:09    1            I know you're in telecommunications.

10:39:16    2            JUROR JENKINS:      That's correct.

10:39:17    3            MS. TRUELOVE:     Are you -- are you familiar with

10:39:18    4   adaptive beamforming?

10:39:19    5            JUROR JENKINS:      No.

10:39:20    6            MS. TRUELOVE:     Know anything about sound source

10:39:24    7   localization?

10:39:25    8            JUROR JENKINS:      Not really, no.

10:39:26    9            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    What about noise -- noise

10:39:29   10   cancellation?

10:39:29   11            JUROR JENKINS:      A little bit.     We just know about

10:39:29   12   BP levels or something like that.

10:39:30   13            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    So at a high level, you know

10:39:32   14   about that?

10:39:33   15            JUROR JENKINS:      Little bit.

10:39:34   16            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    Anything about your

10:39:35   17   profession and work that you think is going to bleed over

10:39:39   18   into this case?

10:39:39   19            JUROR JENKINS:      No.

10:39:40   20            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    I appreciate that.       Thank

10:39:42   21   you very much, Mr. Jenkins.

10:39:45   22            Anybody else on the panel ever heard of adaptive

10:39:48   23   beamforming?    Sound source localization?        Or noise

10:39:53   24   cancellation?     Anybody have any experience or background

10:39:56   25   with electrical engineering or someone -- someone that you

                                                                                        64



10:39:59    1   know well?   No one?

10:40:00    2            Okay.   I want to talk a few minutes about some of

10:40:05    3   the terms that you've already heard in the patent video and

10:40:09    4   some of the things that His Honor has talked about that --

10:40:14    5   that are going to be things that you have to decide if

10:40:16    6   you're -- if you're selected in this case.

10:40:17    7            And you can see up here infringement, validity,

10:40:20    8   prior art, and reasonable royalty.

10:40:22    9            As His Honor told you, Vocalife, the Plaintiff, is

10:40:29   10   going to have the burden to prove infringement.

10:40:31   11            If we can go to the next slide.

10:40:33   12            And there's something about that --

10:40:36   13            And, Mr. Wallace, this is going to resonate with

10:40:37   14   you, probably.

10:40:38   15            If we can go back one, Mr. Baxter, sorry.            The

10:40:42   16   presumption of validity.      There we go.

10:40:46   17            Patents issued by the United States Patent Office

10:40:48   18   are presumed to be valid.

10:40:49   19            Let's talk about that for just a second,

10:40:51   20   Mr. Wallace, if you don't mind.        You had to guess you were

10:40:55   21   going to get picked on since you're the attorney in the

10:40:58   22   room.

10:40:58   23            JUROR WALLACE:      Thank you.

10:40:59   24            MS. TRUELOVE:     You try -- well, you do CPS cases,

10:41:03   25   but just being over there in the DA's office, you've heard

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 65 of 125 PageID #: 18401
                                                                                        65



10:41:06    1   of the presumption of innocence, haven't you?

10:41:10    2            MR. WALLACE:     Yes, absolutely.

10:41:11    3            MS. TRUELOVE:     What does that mean?

10:41:12    4            JUROR WALLACE:      It means in the beginning of the

10:41:14    5   case the Defendant is presumed to be innocent, and it's the

10:41:17    6   burden of the State of Texas to prove that person is guilty

10:41:21    7   beyond a reasonable doubt by putting on evidence that would

10:41:24    8   be persuasive to the jury.

10:41:24    9            MS. TRUELOVE:     Right.    So when any individual

10:41:24   10   charged with a crime walks in, everybody in that jury has

10:41:27   11   to presume their innocence.

10:41:30   12            JUROR WALLACE:      That's correct.

10:41:30   13            MS. TRUELOVE:     There's been no evidence or

10:41:32   14   anything to demonstrate otherwise, right?

10:41:34   15            JUROR WALLACE:      Correct.

10:41:35   16            MS. TRUELOVE:     And that's the same situation we

10:41:37   17   have here in regards to if there's a presumption that the

10:41:39   18   patent is valid, meaning before you hear any evidence, you

10:41:42   19   just have to go with that presumption.          Is that something

10:41:46   20   you can do?

10:41:48   21            JUROR WALLACE:      Yes, absolutely.

10:41:49   22            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    Thank you.

10:41:50   23            And so as Mr. Wallace was saying, what we then

10:41:54   24   have to do as a Plaintiff is we have to bring you evidence

10:41:57   25   to show you that Amazon infringes.         And the Judge talked to

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 66 of 125 PageID #: 18402
                                                                                        66



10:42:00    1   you a little bit about this.

10:42:01    2            And what he told you -- and you can kind of look

10:42:04    3   at our picture on the screen -- is that starting out before

10:42:07    4   you hear any evidence at all, everyone is at an equal

10:42:11    5   standing, haven't heard witnesses testify or seen

10:42:13    6   documents, and we will put on a case that we say, here's

10:42:18    7   what happened.

10:42:19    8            You'll hear testimony from witnesses.           You'll see

10:42:21    9   documents.     And we just have to demonstrate by something

10:42:24   10   called the preponderance of the evidence, that you must be

10:42:27   11   persuaded that our claim of infringement is more probably

10:42:35   12   true than not true.

10:42:36   13            And what that looks like if you want a visual on

10:42:38   14   the scales is that, you know, as all the evidence piles up,

10:42:42   15   you have these little BBs on the scales, we just have to

10:42:48   16   tip the scales just ever so slightly.          We've got that one

10:42:51   17   extra BB or that one piece of evidence that you feel weighs

10:42:55   18   it a little bit in our favor, and then you find

10:42:58   19   infringement.

10:42:58   20            Can everybody follow that particular standard and

10:43:01   21   only hold us accountable to a preponderance of evidence

10:43:07   22   standard and nothing higher?       I see a lot of people shaking

10:43:11   23   their heads.

10:43:12   24            Is there anybody that things, man, if they want to

10:43:15   25   prove Amazon has infringed and used their patent and then

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 67 of 125 PageID #: 18403
                                                                                        67



10:43:18    1   get money for it, they should have to prove it by a higher

10:43:21    2   standard than a preponderance of evidence?           Does anybody

10:43:27    3   feel that way?    I don't see any hands.

10:43:29    4            Well, the other standard that we talked about,

10:43:32    5   that you heard Judge talk about --

10:43:33    6            Okay.    Oh, there is a hand back there.

10:43:33    7            Thank you.     Thanks, Mr. Dacus.

10:43:38    8            JUROR WEAVER:     Talking about the -- excuse me.

10:43:40    9   Talking about the -- in a way that sometimes things are

10:43:47   10   presented in a higher standard, I purchase things from --

10:43:53   11   from online quite a bit.

10:43:56   12            With the COVID 19 coming about, I purchased some

10:44:00   13   things, and they were through Amazon.          And the instructions

10:44:05   14   and the description online didn't tell me where it came

10:44:07   15   from.   When it came, it came from China.

10:44:11   16            Many, many times that I -- you don't know, they do

10:44:13   17   outsourcing to different sellers, but we don't know where

10:44:18   18   they come from.    And I think companies like Amazon have

10:44:21   19   to -- need to reach a little higher standard to where they

10:44:24   20   tell us where do they buy things from.

10:44:27   21            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    Thank you.

10:44:28   22            Amazon -- to turn to Amazon --

10:44:34   23            Thank you, Mr. Ayres.

10:44:35   24            -- standard in this case, and I expect they're

10:44:38   25   going to come in and try and overcome that presumption of

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 68 of 125 PageID #: 18404
                                                                                        68



10:44:41    1   validity.   They're going to come in and tell you that the

10:44:44    2   patent is not valid, that there's something out there

10:44:47    3   called prior art, that something was already out there in a

10:44:50    4   known field that disclosed this invention or taught this

10:44:55    5   invention or -- or just that the Patent Office got it

10:44:58    6   wrong.

10:44:58    7            But in order to do that, in order for you all if

10:45:02    8   you're selected to sit on this jury to take away that

10:45:06    9   presumption of validity --

10:45:07   10            THE COURT:     You have five minutes remaining.

10:45:09   11            MS. TRUELOVE:     Thank you, Your Honor.

10:45:11   12            -- you have to hold them to a higher standard of

10:45:13   13   proof.   They have to come in and prove by what's known as

10:45:17   14   clear and convincing evidence.

10:45:17   15            And -- and what His Honor told you and what you

10:45:20   16   see on the screen is it means you must have an abiding

10:45:24   17   conviction that the truth of the parties' contentions are

10:45:28   18   highly probable.

10:45:29   19            And if you think about that -- if we could see the

10:45:31   20   next slide -- in the scale illustration, what you see is

10:45:36   21   they've got to come forward with a greater weight of

10:45:39   22   evidence, right?     Highly probable.      So those scales are

10:45:42   23   really going to have to tip.

10:45:43   24            So my question to you is, can everyone hold Amazon

10:45:48   25   to that standard?     To come in here, if they want to try and

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 69 of 125 PageID #: 18405
                                                                                        69



10:45:51    1   prove this patent invalid, they're going to have to do it

10:45:54    2   by a higher standard, that of clear and convincing.             Is

10:45:58    3   everyone okay with that?

10:46:01    4            Is there anyone out there that thinks they should

10:46:03    5   have a lower standard or even the same standard, the lower

10:46:06    6   standard that we have to prove infringement?           Anybody think

10:46:08    7   that?

10:46:08    8            Okay.    The last thing I really want to talk to you

10:46:13    9   about today is damages.      And in this case, that's why we're

10:46:19   10   here, right?     Vocalife is saying you took our invention,

10:46:24   11   you put it in your product, you used it, and, therefore, we

10:46:28   12   should be compensated for your use of our invention.             And

10:46:31   13   we're going to be asking for $31 million when it's all said

10:46:34   14   and done.

10:46:35   15            And if I could talk to you, Mr. Hirt, I'm going to

10:46:38   16   pick on you.     You see I've got trees on the screen.          So I

10:46:47   17   want you to think about -- and you might have done this in

10:46:49   18   your career, but you own this property here, and you go out

10:46:53   19   there every once in a while with your family.            You like to

10:46:56   20   picnic and have family reunions and that kind of thing.

10:46:59   21   It's been a few months, and you haven't been out there in a

10:47:00   22   while.   And you get out there and you show up, and it looks

10:47:02   23   like this.

10:47:07   24            JUROR HIRT:     Bad logging job.

10:47:09   25            MS. TRUELOVE:     That's your first thought.         I would

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 70 of 125 PageID #: 18406
                                                                                        70



10:47:12    1   imagine your second thought would be, what happened to all

10:47:15    2   my trees?

10:47:16    3            JUROR HIRT:     Correct.

10:47:17    4            MS. TRUELOVE:     And let's say you found out that

10:47:19    5   somebody just got it wrong, you know, they thought that was

10:47:22    6   a piece of land they were supposed to clear.           It turns out

10:47:25    7   they were wrong, and they were very sorry about it.             They

10:47:28    8   didn't mean to do it.      How about we pay you for one out of

10:47:31    9   every three trees?     Is that all right with you?

10:47:34   10            JUROR HIRT:     No.

10:47:35   11            MS. TRUELOVE:     One out of every two?

10:47:37   12            JUROR HIRT:     No.

10:47:38   13            MS. TRUELOVE:     How many trees do you want to get

10:47:41   14   paid for?

10:47:41   15            JUROR HIRT:     If I knew the law well enough, I'd

10:47:43   16   probably ask for treble damages.

10:47:44   17            MS. TRUELOVE:     But you'd want to get paid for all

10:47:47   18   of the trees?

10:47:48   19            JUROR HIRT:     Correct.

10:47:49   20            MS. TRUELOVE:     And maybe get your land put back in

10:47:51   21   shape or whatever you can recover.

10:47:52   22            JUROR HIRT:     Right.

10:47:53   23            MS. TRUELOVE:     Okay.    Anybody have a problem with

10:47:55   24   that under the law?     Mr. Hirt wants to get paid for all his

10:47:58   25   trees.   Anybody feel differently?        You shouldn't get

                                                                                        71



10:48:01    1   compensated for what was taken from you?

10:48:06    2            Okay.   Thank you, Mr. Hirt.

10:48:07    3            I have just a couple minutes left, and -- and I

10:48:10    4   think what us lawyers do is we -- we worry that maybe there

10:48:17    5   was a question we could have asked and didn't ask, and

10:48:22    6   you're sitting there thinking, gosh, if Ms. Truelove knew

10:48:26    7   this, she wouldn't want me on her jury, or this would just

10:48:31    8   be of interest to her?

10:48:32    9            Is there anybody out there that as you sit there

10:48:35   10   you're thinking to yourself, I've got a reason why I may

10:48:39   11   not be a good jury for this -- or a juror for this kind of

10:48:42   12   case, or I have this reason that's going to make it

10:48:44   13   difficult for me to serve?

10:48:46   14            Mr. Wallace?

10:48:55   15            JUROR WALLACE:      Not really difficult to serve, but

10:48:58   16   I would like to know if I'd be given an opportunity to call

10:49:01   17   the home office and have someone stand in for me if I were

10:49:05   18   selected, because I've got a full day of court tomorrow,

10:49:09   19   and I'm going to have to get people working on that if

10:49:12   20   that's the case.     That's the only concern I have.

10:49:14   21            MS. TRUELOVE:     All right.     I appreciate that, and

10:49:15   22   I'm sure that --

10:49:16   23            THE COURT:     We'll accommodate that if it's

10:49:21   24   necessary.

10:49:22   25            MS. TRUELOVE:     Thank you, Your Honor.

10:49:25    2            MS. TRUELOVE:     Thank you, Your Honor.

10:49:25    3            Anyone else, as you sit here, have a concern, big

10:49:29    4   or small, that you want to raise at this time?

10:49:31    5            Well, with that, I want to thank you very

10:49:34    6   sincerely for your attention.        I -- I want to thank in

10:49:37    7   advance the eight of you that are going to be selected to

10:49:40    8   serve on this jury.

10:49:41    9            We -- we pledge to you to put our case forward and

10:49:44   10   do it in a way that is not wasteful of your time because we

10:49:48   11   know your time is very important, as you're away from your

10:49:53   12   families and your life.

10:49:53   13            So thank you again, and we look forward to

10:49:55   14   presenting our case to the eight of you who are selected.

10:50:00   15            Thank you.

10:50:05   16            THE COURT:     All right.     Mr. Dacus, you may address

10:50:08   17   the panel on behalf of the Defendants.

10:50:10   18            MR. DACUS:     Thank you, Your Honor.

10:50:10   19            THE COURT:     Would you like a warning on your time?

10:50:13   20            MR. DACUS:     If you'd let me know when I have five

10:50:15   21   minutes, please.

10:50:17   22            THE COURT:     I will.

10:50:17   23            MR. DACUS:     Thank you.

10:50:18   24            THE COURT:     You may proceed when you're ready.

10:50:19   25            MR. DACUS:     Thank you.

                                                                                        73



10:50:21    1             Good morning.    I'll reintroduce myself.         I'm Deron

10:50:29    2   Dacus.    I want to start by saying this morning on behalf of

10:50:32    3   the men and women that work at Amazon a very sincere thanks

10:50:36    4   to you.

10:50:36    5             I want you to know it's not lost on anyone at this

10:50:39    6   table that you have very busy lives.         You have other things

10:50:42    7   you need to be doing today.       You need to be tending to your

10:50:45    8   jobs, tending to your kids, tending to your grandkids.              And

10:50:50    9   I want you to know we would not be here if this case was

10:50:53   10   not very important to Amazon.        It is very important.

10:50:56   11             I know from your questionnaires and from what some

10:50:59   12   of you have said that many of you know who Amazon is, what

10:51:03   13   it's about.    Many of you know that they actually sell this

10:51:06   14   device right here, which is called an Echo Dot, that we

10:51:09   15   heard referenced a minute ago.

10:51:12   16             And you can actually -- for those of you who don't

10:51:17   17   have one -- you can actually talk to this thing, and it

10:51:19   18   will talk back to you.      It will provide information.         You

10:51:23   19   can order things over the Internet.

10:51:26   20             It operates through this term we heard earlier

10:51:29   21   called "Alexa," which is this intelligent voice system.

10:51:32   22   And Alexa basically is a brain out there in the Amazon

10:51:36   23   cloud that functions very much like a human brain in

10:51:41   24   determining what you say to it and then responding back to

10:51:43   25   you.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 74 of 125 PageID #: 18410
                                                                                        74



10:51:44    1             What you've heard the folks at the other table say

10:51:46    2   from Vocalife is that this device contains some

10:51:53    3   microphones -- several microphones, what they call a

10:52:01    4   microphone array, that they contend infringes or uses

10:52:03    5   Dr. Li and Vocalife's patents.

10:52:05    6             And if you sit on the jury in this case, what

10:52:08    7   you'll hear is testimony both from Amazon witnesses, people

10:52:12    8   who work on this device and the Alexa on a daily basis and

10:52:14    9   know it inside and out, you'll hear testimony from

10:52:17   10   third-party experts that, in fact, we do not nor have we

10:52:20   11   ever used Vocalife patents.

10:52:24   12             In addition to that, if you sit on this jury,

10:52:29   13   equally important to Amazon, you may remember from the

10:52:35   14   video this morning that the Court played for you, that a

10:52:37   15   jury is -- makes the ultimate determination as to whether

10:52:40   16   or not a patent is valid.       The Patent Office doesn't make

10:52:44   17   that -- the Patent Office doesn't always have all the

10:52:46   18   information.

10:52:47   19             And I'll tell you that the evidence in this case

10:52:48   20   will show you that the patent that was actually issued to

10:52:54   21   Vocalife contained information that was already known in

10:52:58   22   the public.

10:52:58   23             You know from your video that an invention has to

10:53:02   24   be new.   You can't take stuff from the public that's

10:53:04   25   already known in the public, write it down in a patent, and

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 75 of 125 PageID #: 18411
                                                                                        75



10:53:08    1   have a valid patent issued.       And that's what I think the

10:53:10    2   evidence will ultimately show you in this case.

10:53:13    3            And I tell you all that not to -- not to try to

10:53:20    4   persuade you, because you need to listen to the evidence,

10:53:23    5   obviously.   But I tell you that so that as we go through

10:53:25    6   questions this morning, you know a little bit about what

10:53:28    7   this case is about.     And if there's something about what I

10:53:30    8   said to you that concerns you, then I want us to talk about

10:53:33    9   it.

10:53:37   10            I do think it's important -- the Judge has done

10:53:40   11   it, you've been kind enough to do it, Ms. Truelove did

10:53:40   12   it -- for you to know a little bit about who I am.             I wish

10:53:45   13   I could tell you that it is interesting enough that someone

10:53:45   14   was going to make a movie or a book about it, but it's not.

10:53:49   15            I grew up over in Gilmer, Texas.          Graduated from

10:53:53   16   Gilmer High School.     Was fortunate enough to get a baseball

10:53:57   17   scholarship and play baseball at Texas A&M.           Graduated from

10:54:01   18   there.

10:54:02   19            Like the Judge, I went to Baylor Law School where

10:54:06   20   I also met my wife who was in law school, to whom I've been

10:54:10   21   happily married now for 26 years.         Please make sure you

10:54:15   22   write "happily" in there, Ms. Holmes, as you take that

10:54:19   23   down.

10:54:19   24            We have two college-aged kids.         Like Ms. Truelove,

10:54:19   25   mine are in their apartment doing it.          And I'm paying for

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 76 of 125 PageID #: 18412
                                                                                        76



10:54:25    1   an apartment as they attend virtually, like many of you

10:54:26    2   are, probably, trying to make our way in this strange world

10:54:29    3   we live in.

10:54:30    4            So that's -- that's a little bit about me.

10:54:33    5            But the purpose -- the main purpose this morning

10:54:36    6   is for me to learn more about you.         And as the Judge said

10:54:39    7   to you, there's no wrong answer.        If -- if I ask you

10:54:44    8   something, please just tell me what you're thinking.

10:54:47    9   That's the great thing about this country.           We're all

10:54:50   10   entitled to our opinions.       And we're all -- I certainly

10:54:53   11   want to hear yours this morning.

10:54:55   12            Now, let -- let me start off by determining

10:55:01   13   whether or not anyone on this panel knows folks sitting at

10:55:04   14   this table here.

10:55:05   15            So you've been introduced to Mr. Sam Baxter.

10:55:09   16   Mr. Baxter is a lawyer here in Marshall, has been for many

10:55:13   17   years.

10:55:13   18            I know, Mr. Wallace, that -- that you know

10:55:15   19   Mr. Baxter, and I want to talk to you about that.

10:55:18   20            But does anyone know or know of Sam Baxter, would

10:55:22   21   you raise your hand and let me know, please?           Okay.     I

10:55:25   22   don't -- I don't see any hands.

10:55:27   23            And sort of to complete this table, Ms. Truelove

10:55:30   24   just spoke to you.     Does anyone know Jennifer Truelove?

10:55:34   25   Raise your hand and let me know.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 77 of 125 PageID #: 18413
                                                                                        77



10:55:35    1            And her -- as she said her husband, Kurt, also

10:55:42    2   practices here in Marshall.         Anyone know Kurt, raise your

10:55:45    3   hand and let me know.

10:55:46    4            All right.     Mr. Wallace, can I talk to you for one

10:55:49    5   second, please, sir?

10:55:51    6            JUROR WALLACE:      Yes.

10:55:52    7            MR. DACUS:     Now, Ms. Truelove asked you if it was

10:55:54    8   a problem for her that you knew Mr. Baxter's wife and him,

10:55:59    9   and you said no.     You want to guess what my question is?

10:56:03   10            JUROR WALLACE:      Yeah.

10:56:04   11            MR. DACUS:     Is that a problem for me?

10:56:05   12            JUROR WALLACE:      No, sir, it's not.

10:56:07   13            MR. DACUS:     Are you sure?

10:56:08   14            JUROR WALLACE:      I'm sure.    I don't actually know

10:56:12   15   Mr. Baxter, but I've known Laurie for years, practiced in

10:56:17   16   front of her for years.      I respect her greatly.        And I'd

10:56:22   17   like to think she thinks the same about me.

10:56:25   18            And I would say that -- that part of that respect

10:56:27   19   is predicated on we do what we're counted on to do in our

10:56:33   20   roles when we enter into the courtroom.          And if I were

10:56:37   21   asked to serve as a juror, then I would understand what

10:56:39   22   that role is.

10:56:40   23            I certainly understand what it means to be an

10:56:42   24   officer of the court.

10:56:44   25            So, you know, what you good folks have to say is

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 78 of 125 PageID #: 18414
                                                                                        78



10:56:46    1   not evidence.    What the people from the witness stand says

10:56:50    2   is evidence, and eight of us are going to tell you whether

10:56:52    3   that's a fact or not.

10:56:53    4            MR. DACUS:     So those Scales of Justice are

10:56:55    5   completely even on Lady Justice right there?           You're

10:56:58    6   telling me that if you sat on this jury, the scales for

10:57:01    7   Amazon and for me as their lawyer would be equal, we'd

10:57:05    8   start out equal just like the Scales of Justice; is that

10:57:08    9   what you're telling me?

10:57:09   10            JUROR WALLACE:      Yes, sir, because those are the

10:57:11   11   rules we play by.

10:57:13   12            MR. DACUS:     I appreciate it very much.        Thank you,

10:57:14   13   sir.

10:57:14   14            And let me just cover this table.          Fred Fabricant

10:57:20   15   sits at this table also.      Mr. Fabricant has his own law

10:57:23   16   firm in New York.     I assume no one knows Mr. Fabricant or

10:57:26   17   his law firm.    But if you do, raise your hand and let me

10:57:28   18   know.   Okay.   I don't see any hands.

10:57:30   19            Thank you.

10:57:32   20            You know -- let -- let me ask a global question

10:57:36   21   about Amazon.    Many of you know who Amazon is.          A lot of

10:57:40   22   you raised your hands as to whether or not you've ever

10:57:42   23   ordered something from Amazon.

10:57:45   24            What I need to know, and this is what you might

10:57:47   25   expect, is there any reason that you would slightly

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 79 of 125 PageID #: 18415
                                                                                        79



10:57:52    1   disfavor and the scales would not be completely even for

10:57:56    2   Amazon if you sat on this jury?        Is anyone in that boat?

10:58:01    3   Is any -- and, look, Amazon is in the customer service

10:58:04    4   business.    And when you're in that business and even though

10:58:06    5   your philosophy is to put the customer first, every now and

10:58:10    6   then you make somebody mad, right?

10:58:13    7             So that's what I need to know.        If anyone for any

10:58:15    8   reason, any reason at all, says, look, Amazon is going to

10:58:18    9   start off just a little bit behind in my book, can you

10:58:22   10   raise your hand and let me know that?          Okay.   I see no

10:58:24   11   hands.    Thank you.

10:58:25   12             Let me do this:     Mr. Porter, can I talk with you

10:58:40   13   for a second, sir?     And I'm going to tell you why.          Did I

10:58:43   14   hear you say you had eight kids and seven boys?

10:58:46   15             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      That is correct.

10:58:47   16             MR. DACUS:    All right.     So let me ask you this:

10:58:49   17   Those seven boys ever get in any scuffles or little fights

10:58:54   18   when they were growing up?

10:58:55   19             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      They most certainly did.

10:58:57   20             MR. DACUS:    And so when you caught them in those

10:58:59   21   scuffles or fights, I bet they ran to momma; is that true?

10:59:04   22             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      Didn't do them any good,

10:59:06   23   though.

10:59:06   24             MR. DACUS:    We're going to get to that.         And they

10:59:08   25   didn't walk to momma, they ran, didn't they?

10:59:11    1              JUROR BOBBY PORTER:     That's right.

10:59:12    2              MR. DACUS:   And let me tell you why I ask you

10:59:14    3   that.     There's something innate in all of us that says it's

10:59:18    4   important to tell our story first.         And that's why those

10:59:21    5   boys were running to momma because they wanted to tell her

10:59:24    6   their story first; isn't that true?

10:59:26    7              JUROR BOBBY PORTER:     That's right.

10:59:27    8              MR. DACUS:   Now, the reason I'm asking you this is

10:59:29    9   because these folks over here brought this lawsuit, so

10:59:32   10   they're going to get to talk first.         No matter how fast I

10:59:34   11   run, I can't beat them.      They get to talk first.        Do you

10:59:38   12   understand that?

10:59:38   13              JUROR BOBBY PORTER:     I gotcha.

10:59:40   14              MR. DACUS:   Now, here's what I want to know about

10:59:41   15   your wife.     Being the good momma that she was, and I know

10:59:45   16   she was, she didn't just take that story from that first

10:59:50   17   boy and accept it, did she?       She made sure she got the full

10:59:53   18   story from both kids before she made a decision on who was

10:59:56   19   right or wrong; am I correct about that?

10:59:58   20              JUROR BOBBY PORTER:     You're correct.

11:00:00   21              MR. DACUS:   So that's -- that's my long-winded way

11:00:02   22   of saying to you, I'm not going to get to talk in this

11:00:05   23   lawsuit until next week, okay?        I'm going to have to go

11:00:08   24   second.

11:00:08   25              So can you sit here in this courtroom and not make

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 81 of 125 PageID #: 18417
                                                                                        81



11:00:11    1   a decision until you hear evidence from the both -- both

11:00:14    2   sides?

11:00:15    3             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      I have to.

11:00:16    4             MR. DACUS:    Okay.    So that means you will, right?

11:00:19    5             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      Yes, I will.

11:00:20    6             MR. DACUS:    Yeah, and that's -- I mean, that's why

11:00:22    7   your wife did it, right?        That's the fair thing to do, to

11:00:24    8   get both sides -- let me ask you this:          Did you ever find

11:00:27    9   that one of those boys, the one that ran there first, might

11:00:30   10   not have given the full story?

11:00:32   11             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      Not only him, but the rest of

11:00:35   12   them, too.

11:00:36   13             MR. DACUS:    And that's a good point.        You've got

11:00:38   14   to listen to everything and then figure out where the truth

11:00:42   15   lies, right?

11:00:43   16             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      That's right.

11:00:45   17             MR. DACUS:    And you can do that in this courtroom?

11:00:47   18             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      Yes, I can.

11:00:48   19             MR. DACUS:    Okay.    Thank you so much.      Let me ask

11:00:49   20   you a question, Mr. Porter.        Did you happen to know Ken

11:00:52   21   Reeves?

11:00:53   22             JUROR BOBBY PORTER:      Yes.

11:00:53   23             MR. DACUS:    Well, I went to A&M.       Ken is about two

11:00:53   24   years older than I am, so I didn't know if you knew him or

11:00:53   25   not.

11:00:57    1            JUROR BOBBY PORTER:       I was his hero.

11:00:58    2            MR. DACUS:     He's a -- you were his hero?

11:01:00    3            JUROR BOBBY PORTER:       I was his hero.

11:01:02    4            MR. DACUS:     Let me tell you what, he's a fine

11:01:05    5   human being.

11:01:05    6            JUROR BOBBY PORTER:       He is.

11:01:06    7            MR. DACUS:     I'll say that.      Thank you.

11:01:07    8            So here's what I need to know from everybody.

11:01:09    9   You've heard my long-winded story, and the purpose of which

11:01:13   10   is to say, it's very serious.

11:01:15   11            The Plaintiff is going to get to put their case on

11:01:17   12   first.   You're going to hear their evidence today and

11:01:20   13   tomorrow, and probably part of Monday.          And no one from

11:01:23   14   this table is going to get to take the witness stand until

11:01:26   15   probably Tuesday or so of next week.

11:01:28   16            And so that I can sleep well tonight and over the

11:01:31   17   weekend, is there anybody who says, look, I just cannot

11:01:35   18   wait that long to make a decision?          I'm just going to

11:01:38   19   listen to the evidence from the Plaintiff, and I might make

11:01:40   20   a decision just based on what they say?          Is there anybody

11:01:43   21   in that boat?    In that camp?

11:01:46   22            Okay.   Let me ask it a different way.          So that I

11:01:48   23   sleep better, can you raise your hand if you'll agree to

11:01:51   24   wait and hear all of the evidence before you make a

11:01:53   25   decision?   Will you raise your hand and let me know?            Okay.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 83 of 125 PageID #: 18419
                                                                                        83



11:01:57    1   That looks like everybody.       Thank you.

11:01:58    2            Now, I want to ask you a question, and before I do

11:02:05    3   it, I want to preface it by saying the Judge told you I'm

11:02:11    4   not going to pry into your private lives, and I'm not.              So

11:02:14    5   when I ask this question, don't think that I'm going to ask

11:02:17    6   for details.

11:02:18    7            But has anyone here ever been falsely accused of

11:02:22    8   doing something?     I'm not talking about in a court of law.

11:02:22    9   I'm just talking about in your everyday life, somebody

11:02:26   10   accused you of doing something that you know you didn't do?

11:02:29   11   Any -- anybody in that boat?       Just in everyday life?

11:02:32   12            Let's see, Mr. Stephenson, can I talk to you about

11:02:35   13   it?

11:02:36   14            That's -- I'm sorry, that's 16 -- Juror 16.

11:02:42   15            And I'm not asking for details, Mr. Stephenson.

11:02:46   16   Let me tell you that up front.        So here's what I want to

11:02:49   17   know from you, though:      Did you feel like you had the right

11:02:51   18   to defend yourself?

11:02:54   19            JUROR STEPHENSON:      Oh, yeah.

11:02:55   20            MR. DACUS:     Okay.   And when you were falsely

11:02:56   21   accused, how did it make you feel?

11:03:00   22            JUROR STEPHENSON:      It's not good.      Doesn't make

11:03:02   23   you feel good at all.

11:03:03   24            MR. DACUS:     Make you mad?

11:03:04   25            JUROR STEPHENSON:      Oh, yeah.

11:03:04    1            THE COURT:     Mr. Stephenson, I'm going to ask you

11:03:07    2   again to hold that microphone up.

11:03:08    3            MR. DACUS:     So you understand that Amazon is in

11:03:11    4   this courtroom because they've been accused of doing

11:03:13    5   something that Plaintiff says is wrong, right?

11:03:17    6            JUROR STEPHENSON:      Right.

11:03:18    7            MR. DACUS:     Do you agree, as the Judge said this

11:03:21    8   morning, under the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution,

11:03:24    9   we have the right to come here and defend ourselves?

11:03:26   10            JUROR STEPHENSON:      Yes.

11:03:28   11            MR. DACUS:     Even though we're Amazon, even though

11:03:30   12   we're this company, and they're a smaller company in Plano,

11:03:34   13   Vocalife, you think we have the right to present evidence

11:03:36   14   to a jury and defend ourselves?

11:03:38   15            JUROR STEPHENSON:      Right.

11:03:40   16            MR. DACUS:     Thank you, sir.

11:03:41   17            So -- so can you -- does anyone disagree with

11:03:44   18   Mr. Stephenson, that we do -- that Amazon does not have a

11:03:47   19   right to defend itself?      Anybody in that boat?        Okay.

11:03:52   20            Mr. Sheppard, let me ask you a question -- I'll

11:04:08   21   tell you why once I get you the microphone.

11:04:10   22            That's No. 2.     I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

11:04:15   23            When Ms. Truelove asked a question -- I don't

11:04:17   24   remember the exact question -- but it was something along

11:04:20   25   the lines of, do you blame them for bringing a case against

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 85 of 125 PageID #: 18421
                                                                                        85



11:04:25    1   Amazon or something like that, and I thought I saw you

11:04:27    2   shake your head.

11:04:28    3              And I want to make sure, do you have anything that

11:04:29    4   I should be worried about as it relates to Amazon?

11:04:31    5              JUROR SHEPPARD:      No, sir, I don't.

11:04:33    6              MR. DACUS:     Okay, perfect.    I just didn't know.

11:04:34    7   Maybe you weren't shaking your head.         I just wanted to make

11:04:34    8   sure.

11:04:36    9              And, by the way, do you know Mr. Porter?          I know

11:04:39   10   y'all are both from Pittsburg.

11:04:41   11              JUROR SHEPPARD:      I probably know his kids.

11:04:43   12              MR. DACUS:     That's -- he's got a few of them.        All

11:04:47   13   right.     Thank you, sir.

11:04:48   14              And, by the way, let me ask this -- it reminds me

11:04:52   15   to ask, because I'm not sure anybody is left in Leesburg,

11:04:56   16   but does anybody on this panel know someone else?             I mean,

11:05:00   17   can you look around and see if you know anybody on the

11:05:02   18   panel?     And, if you do, would you raise your hand and let

11:05:05   19   me know?

11:05:05   20              Okay.    Juror No. 9, that's Mr. Evers, No. 9.         Who

11:05:13   21   do you know on the panel, Mr. Evers?

11:05:15   22              JUROR EVERS:     I know Mr. William Ayres.       He and I

11:05:18   23   worked together at Jefferson.

11:05:20   24              MR. DACUS:     Mr. Ayres, what number is Mr. Ayres?

11:05:22   25   Oh, perfect.       All right.   And where did y'all work?

11:05:25    1             JUROR EVERS:     In Jefferson ISD.

11:05:28    2             MR. DACUS:     And since I have you up, Mr. Evers,

11:05:31    3   you said you were principal somewhere.

11:05:33    4             JUROR EVERS:     I was principal at Harleton Junior

11:05:33    5   High, and then Jefferson at the high school and at the

11:05:37    6   primary school.

11:05:37    7             MR. DACUS:     Okay.   And -- but you've retired from

11:05:39    8   that.

11:05:39    9             JUROR EVERS:     Yes, sir.

11:05:39   10             MR. DACUS:     And now you're a pastor?

11:05:41   11             JUROR EVERS:     Yes, sir.     I still drive a bus,

11:05:44   12   though.

11:05:44   13             MR. DACUS:     I got you.     That's tough work these

11:05:47   14   days.

11:05:47   15             JUROR EVERS:     I love it.     I love kids.

11:05:49   16             MR. DACUS:     I hear you.     I imagine, like

11:05:51   17   Mr. Porter, you've settled a dispute or two between kids?

11:05:55   18             JUROR EVERS:     A couple, a couple, yes, sir.

11:05:57   19             MR. DACUS:     And you agree with him that you don't

11:05:59   20   always get the full story on the first go-round?

11:06:02   21             JUROR EVERS:     Don't always get the full story.

11:06:05   22   Have to ask several questions.

11:06:06   23             MR. DACUS:     All right.     Thank you, sir.

11:06:07   24             Who else said they know somebody?         That's

11:06:11   25   Ms. Rangel.   Am I pronouncing that correctly?

11:06:14    1             JUROR RANGEL:     Rangel.

11:06:14    2             MR. DACUS:     Rangel.

11:06:14    3             JUROR RANGEL:     I -- actually -- he probably

11:06:16    4   doesn't realize this, but I actually know Shane Jenkins.                I

11:06:16    5   work really closely with his wife at Hallsville ISD.

11:06:20    6             MR. DACUS:     Okay.     Perfect.    Thank you very much

11:06:22    7   for letting me know that.

11:06:23    8             Anyone else know someone on the panel?

11:06:31    9             That's Ms. Blackwell.        Who do you know

11:06:33   10   Ms. Blackwell?

11:06:34   11             JUROR BLACKWELL:       I know Ms. Huskey, she's a

11:06:36   12   customer of mine, and also Ms. Banks, she's -- was the

11:06:42   13   postmaster, worked at the post office.

11:06:45   14             MR. DACUS:     You said she was a customer.        What do

11:06:47   15   you do?

11:06:48   16             JUROR BLACKWELL:       I'm a manager, alterations.

11:06:50   17             MR. DACUS:     Okay.     Your husband works at Priefert

11:06:53   18   you said, right?

11:06:53   19             JUROR BLACKWELL:       Correct.

11:06:54   20             MR. DACUS:     What does he do there?

11:06:56   21             JUROR BLACKWELL:       He's a ranch foreman.

11:06:58   22             MR. DACUS:     Okay.     Thank you very much.

11:06:59   23             Did I -- Ms. Banks, No. 1.          Ms. Banks, who do you

11:07:13   24   know?

11:07:13   25             JUROR BANKS:     Ms. Huskey and Ms. Blackwell.

11:07:16    1              MR. DACUS:     Okay.

11:07:16    2              JUROR BANKS:     Simply because I was the postmaster,

11:07:20    3   they were customers.

11:07:21    4              MR. DACUS:     They were on your Leesburg route.

11:07:27    5              JUROR BANKS:     There you go.

11:07:28    6              MR. DACUS:     Okay.   Anyone else know someone on the

11:07:31    7   panel?     All right.   Great.

11:07:34    8              Let me say a word of thanks to each of you for

11:07:37    9   filling out a questionnaire, and the reason it's important

11:07:39   10   to do that, I'll just tell you, is it shortens this

11:07:43   11   process.

11:07:44   12              This process is probably, in your minds, still a

11:07:47   13   little bit too long.       But by filling out those

11:07:49   14   questionnaires in advance, it does shorten this process,

11:07:52   15   and it makes our job easier.        So I want to thank you for

11:07:55   16   that.

11:07:56   17              And I wish I was smart enough to memorize all

11:07:58   18   those things, but I did see that some of you checked or

11:08:02   19   wrote that either you or someone that was close to you had

11:08:05   20   a patent.     And that's what I want to know.

11:08:07   21              Who -- who -- can you raise your hand and let me

11:08:10   22   know?

11:08:10   23              So, let's see, No. 7, that's Mr. Hirt.         Let me

11:08:16   24   talk to you first, and I'm going to cover everybody.

11:08:18   25              Who -- who do you know that has a patent,

11:08:21    1   Mr. Hirt?

11:08:22    2             JUROR HIRT:    My best friend when I grew up and

11:08:25    3   knew each other since we were four years old.            And after he

11:08:28    4   got out of college, he worked for an oil services company

11:08:33    5   in their chemical lab, and he developed -- they'd been

11:08:39    6   working on chemicals -- and chemicals to stop corrosion of

11:08:42    7   the pipes, pipelines.

11:08:46    8             And he came in with new eyes and new ideas and

11:08:50    9   things, and he developed six different chemicals that they

11:08:52   10   ended up putting patents on.

11:08:54   11             MR. DACUS:    Okay.

11:08:55   12             JUROR HIRT:    And so I told him, I said, what

11:08:56   13   they're going to do is they're going to come to you and

11:09:00   14   give you a dollar, and you're going to hand them that

11:09:04   15   patent.     And that's exactly what they did.

11:09:06   16             MR. DACUS:    So let me ask you this:        These folks

11:09:07   17   over here claim they have a patent.         And, obviously,

11:09:09   18   they're suing Amazon.      Is there anything about that

11:09:12   19   experience that would cause you to disfavor my side or to

11:09:14   20   disfavor Amazon in any way?

11:09:17   21             JUROR HIRT:    No, this is just a normal dispute.

11:09:20   22             MR. DACUS:    Okay.   And let me -- since I have you

11:09:23   23   up, I know Ms. Truelove asked you -- showed you that

11:09:25   24   picture of trees cut down, and you said something about,

11:09:28   25   I'd make them pay a lot of money, treble damages.

11:09:32    1             If I had a heart rate monitor on, my heart rate

11:09:37    2   probably went up pretty good there.         So what I need to know

11:09:39    3   from you, sir, is --

11:09:39    4             JUROR HIRT:    You also have to prove that there was

11:09:42    5   egregious --

11:09:44    6             MR. DACUS:    Thank you.

11:09:45    7             JUROR HIRT:    The burden of proof then comes on my

11:09:47    8   side, too, if we have to prove that the logger that did it

11:09:50    9   did it egregiously.

11:09:53   10             MR. DACUS:    And that's really what I want to know

11:09:54   11   from you, in all seriousness -- I mean, this is -- this is

11:09:57   12   a serious issue, and patent lawsuits are kind of like

11:10:03   13   trespass.

11:10:03   14             JUROR HIRT:    Right.

11:10:04   15             MR. DACUS:    I mean, if you're going to say you

11:10:05   16   trespassed, you need to show that you came within

11:10:08   17   somebody's fence line, right, in their borders?

11:10:11   18             JUROR HIRT:    Correct.

11:10:11   19             MR. DACUS:    So could you do that in this case?          I

11:10:15   20   mean, would you force these folks to actually prove their

11:10:19   21   case?

11:10:19   22             JUROR HIRT:    I think both sides have got to prove

11:10:21   23   their case.

11:10:22   24             MR. DACUS:    Understood.     That's all I need you to

11:10:24   25   say.    And so you don't -- because she showed you --

11:10:25    1              JUROR HIRT:     Neither one of you -- you're both at

11:10:27    2   the table right now, so we don't know which side is which.

11:10:30    3              MR. DACUS:     Perfect.     That's all I need you to

11:10:32    4   say.     I appreciate that very much.

11:10:36    5              Now, somebody else had their hand up.

11:10:38    6              No. 33 is Mr. Wiley.

11:10:40    7              JUROR WILEY:     Yes, my father was a lamp physicist

11:10:44    8   at General Electric.       He has over 300 patents with his name

11:10:48    9   on it.     He invented the quartz-halogen lamp.

11:10:53   10              And also I have an uncle who was an entrepreneur,

11:10:59   11   and he patented a rotary engine and a talking device for

11:11:02   12   people with a larynx out.

11:11:06   13              MR. DACUS:     Is it -- and did you say 300 patents

11:11:09   14   your father has?

11:11:10   15              JUROR WILEY:     Yeah, he has over 300 patents.

11:11:12   16              MR. DACUS:     Okay.   Is there anything about that

11:11:14   17   experience that would cause you to tend to favor the folks

11:11:18   18   who claim they have a patent in this lawsuit?

11:11:20   19              JUROR WILEY:     No.   That was just his job, and we

11:11:23   20   didn't really talk about it a lot.

11:11:25   21              MR. DACUS:     Understood.     You could be fair, is the

11:11:27   22   bottom line?

11:11:28   23              JUROR WILEY:     Absolutely.

11:11:30   24              MR. DACUS:     All right.     Did somebody else right

11:11:31   25   next to you have their hand up?

11:11:39    1            Ms. Lewis?

11:11:44    2            No, I'm sorry, Ms. Blackwell.

11:11:45    3            JUROR BLACKWELL:        Yeah, I briefly had a patent

11:11:46    4   with inseparable sheets with my boss.

11:11:51    5            MR. DACUS:     I saw that.

11:11:52    6            JUROR BLACKWELL:        When I changed jobs, I signed

11:11:54    7   off on the patent, so, yeah.

11:11:55    8            MR. DACUS:     Is there anything about that

11:11:57    9   experience that would cause you to -- to favor Vocalife in

11:12:00   10   this case?

11:12:01   11            JUROR BLACKWELL:        Huh-uh, no.

11:12:03   12            MR. DACUS:     Thank you very much.

11:12:03   13            Anybody else who has personal experience with

11:12:09   14   filing a patent?

11:12:11   15            All right.     Great.

11:12:13   16            JUROR LEWIS:     I don't have personal experience

11:12:14   17   with filing a patent, but when I worked for Lone Star

11:12:18   18   Steel, we had our premium threads that were patented.              And

11:12:21   19   I worked with all those guys.

11:12:23   20            And I also worked with a subsidiary of Lone Star

11:12:26   21   Steel with the hydrosonic system.         And they had some

11:12:29   22   patents on some scrubbing devices, and I worked with the

11:12:32   23   engineers on the selling of those products.

11:12:34   24            MR. DACUS:     Perfect.     Thank you very much,

11:12:45    1            Let me talk to you for a second, Mr. Miller, if I

11:12:49    2   could.

11:12:49    3            That's No. 4, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

11:12:53    4            JUROR MILLER:     Yes, sir.

11:12:54    5            MR. DACUS:     Ms. Truelove asked you some questions

11:12:56    6   about whether or not you thought it would be okay if

11:12:59    7   somebody was using Eastman patents for Eastman to -- to

11:13:02    8   file a lawsuit and protect themselves, and you said yes.

11:13:06    9            JUROR MILLER:     Yes, sir.

11:13:07   10            MR. DACUS:     As you naturally should, right?

11:13:10   11            JUROR MILLER:     Right.

11:13:11   12            MR. DACUS:     And my question to you, sir, is, do

11:13:13   13   you agree that people who are accused of patent

11:13:15   14   infringement have a right to come to the courtroom and

11:13:18   15   defend themselves also?

11:13:20   16            JUROR MILLER:     Completely.

11:13:21   17            MR. DACUS:     All right.     That's all I needed.       So I

11:13:23   18   can sleep well tonight knowing that if you sat on this

11:13:27   19   jury, you'd just listen to the evidence and make a decision

11:13:30   20   based on the evidence?

11:13:32   21            JUROR MILLER:     Yes, sir.

11:13:33   22            MR. DACUS:     All right.     Thank you very much.

11:13:34   23            Let's see, Ms. Edwards, there's something in your

11:13:37   24   questionnaire I wanted to ask you about --

11:13:39   25            JUROR EDWARDS:      Okay.

11:13:39    1             MR. DACUS:    -- if I might.      I'm not picking on

11:13:42    2   you.

11:13:42    3             I thought your questionnaire said that you had

11:13:45    4   some expertise in computer programming.

11:13:48    5             JUROR EDWARDS:     No.     Just like computer training

11:13:50    6   and all that for work.

11:13:51    7             MR. DACUS:    Okay.      You did check something on the

11:13:54    8   questionnaire?    I didn't make that up, did I?

11:13:57    9             JUROR EDWARDS:     I don't -- I don't know.

11:13:57   10             MR. DACUS:    Okay.

11:13:58   11             JUROR EDWARDS:     That was last week or the week

11:14:00   12   before, so it may have gone out of my mind.

11:14:03   13             MR. DACUS:    The bottom line is, you don't really

11:14:06   14   consider yourself to have any particular expertise in

11:14:10   15   computer programming?

11:14:11   16             JUROR EDWARDS:     Oh, no, no.

11:14:13   17             MR. DACUS:    All right.      Thank you very much.

11:14:14   18             Let me ask a question about expertise.          I mean, I

11:14:18   19   told you that this lawsuit is going to be about, in large

11:14:21   20   part, these microphone arrays and this beamforming that

11:14:25   21   Ms. Truelove talked to you about and how these things

11:14:28   22   listen.

11:14:28   23             Does anybody have any expertise in acoustics or

11:14:32   24   microphones, any expertise in those areas?           Can you raise

11:14:36   25   your hand and let me know?

11:14:37    1            That's Ms. Hodges.        Can you tell me about that,

11:14:45    2   please, ma'am, once you get the microphone?

11:14:51    3            JUROR HODGES:     Well, I don't have the expertise,

11:14:53    4   but my dad had the knowledge, and I listened and watched

11:14:57    5   growing up, of him, with microphones.          And he was an

11:15:00    6   electrician, so he put a speaker system through our house

11:15:05    7   that he pretty much -- I don't want to use the wrong

11:15:09    8   word -- he rigged up himself.        So, yes, I have knowledge of

11:15:13    9   how it works.

11:15:14   10            MR. DACUS:     Okay.   All right.     Thank you.

11:15:17   11            JUROR HODGES:     Okay.

11:15:19   12            MR. DACUS:     Thank you very much.

11:15:20   13            Anybody else?

11:15:21   14            Let's see, that's Mr. Gardner, 27.

11:15:24   15            THE COURT:     You have five minutes remaining.

11:15:27   16            MR. DACUS:     Thank you, Your Honor.

11:15:28   17            Mr. Gardner, did you say you have --

11:15:35   18            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        Hang on, we're waiting on

11:15:37   19   a microphone.

11:15:37   20            MR. DACUS:     Oh, I'm sorry.

11:15:37   21            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        He's got one if you want

11:15:39   22   to --

11:15:39   23            MR. DACUS:     Yes, sir, I do.

11:15:39   24            Mr. Wiley.

11:15:41   25            JUROR WILEY:     I wouldn't call it expertise, but we

                                                                                        96



11:15:43    1   have to have in physics a general understanding of all that

11:15:46    2   stuff, so I've studied it in general.

11:15:49    3              And I'm also a musician, so I know a little more

11:15:53    4   about noise cancellation and that stuff.

11:15:56    5              But nothing professional or long-term.         Just

11:16:00    6   general studies in all those fields.

11:16:03    7              MR. DACUS:   Perfect.

11:16:03    8              Mr. Gardner, please don't take offense.          As

11:16:07    9   Ms. Truelove said, we're not likely to reach you, and the

11:16:07   10   Judge told me I had five minutes, so I want to ask one more

11:16:13   11   different question if that's okay?         Is that all right?

11:16:13   12              All right.   So here's what I want to cover before

11:16:16   13   I need to sit down, and that is this issue about invalidity

11:16:22   14   and this presumption of validity, that you heard about this

11:16:25   15   morning.

11:16:25   16              You hear -- you heard on the video that you

11:16:27   17   watched, that the Judge provided, that despite that

11:16:31   18   presumption of validity, the jury makes the ultimate

11:16:35   19   determination as to whether or not a patent is valid.              And

11:16:37   20   what you're going to hear in this case and the evidence is

11:16:40   21   that the Patent Office, at least in our opinion, did not

11:16:43   22   have all of the information in front of them to make that

11:16:47   23   decision.

11:16:47   24              So -- so here's what I need to know from folks.

11:16:53   25   Can you -- are you willing -- even though a patent -- the

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 97 of 125 PageID #: 18433
                                                                                        97



11:16:56    1   Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent, are you

11:16:58    2   willing to sit as a juror here and invalidate that patent

11:17:03    3   if the evidence shows you that, in fact, the stuff was

11:17:07    4   known in the public and the patent is not valid?            Are you

11:17:10    5   willing to do that?      I need you to raise your hand and let

11:17:13    6   me know that you are willing to do that.          I need to -- I

11:17:17    7   need to make sure.

11:17:28    8             Is there anyone who is not willing to do that?

11:17:28    9   Raise your hand.

11:17:30   10             Mr. Green, you seem hesitant.

11:17:32   11             JUROR GREEN:     I'm trying to understand.

11:17:33   12             MR. DACUS:     Let me get you a microphone -- let me

11:17:35   13   get you a microphone, please, sir.

11:17:36   14             JUROR GREEN:     I'm not sure I understood the

11:17:38   15   question.

11:17:39   16             MR. DACUS:     It's probably because it was poor.

11:17:42   17   And it won't be the last one I'll ask.

11:17:43   18             So we're going to prove to you -- so we're going

11:17:46   19   to put on evidence to show you that this patent, we think,

11:17:48   20   is invalid, even though the Patent Office issued it.

11:17:54   21             Are you willing to sit as a juror, and if we prove

11:17:57   22   that to you, are you willing to say that, in fact, this

11:17:59   23   patent is invalid, even though it was issued by the Patent

11:18:01   24   Office?

11:18:01   25             JUROR GREEN:     Yes.

11:18:03    1            MR. DACUS:     Okay.   Perfect.     Thank you very much.

11:18:04    2            And, Mr. Smith, let me -- let me ask you a

11:18:08    3   question.

11:18:09    4            That's No. 15.

11:18:13    5            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, sir.

11:18:14    6            MR. DACUS:     I know you've sat on a criminal jury,

11:18:17    7   right?

11:18:17    8            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, sir.

11:18:17    9            MR. DACUS:     Did y'all find that person -- that

11:18:19   10   Defendant guilty?

11:18:20   11            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, sir.

11:18:21   12            MR. DACUS:     Do you remember the Judge told you

11:18:24   13   that there was a presumption of innocence, just like what's

11:18:26   14   been talked about this morning?

11:18:28   15            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, sir.

11:18:28   16            MR. DACUS:     And so my assumption is the State

11:18:30   17   overcame that presumption of innocence by evidence, and

11:18:31   18   y'all were able to find the Defendant guilty; is that

11:18:33   19   right?

11:18:34   20            JUROR SMITH:     That's right.

11:18:34   21            MR. DACUS:     So you know firsthand that there's a

11:18:40   22   presumption but that can be overcome by evidence; you agree

11:18:42   23   with that?

11:18:43   24            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, I do.

11:18:43   25            MR. DACUS:     All right.     Thank you very much.

11:18:44    1            I'm going to sit down now because the Judge is

11:18:50    2   going to make me.     But before I do, I'm going to ask the

11:18:53    3   same question Ms. Truelove did.        And, that is, I've done

11:18:57    4   this long enough that I know I do not always ask all the

11:19:02    5   right questions.

11:19:02    6            So if you're sitting there thinking, man, that --

11:19:05    7   this -- that lawyer, if he knew this about me, he would not

11:19:10    8   want me on this jury.

11:19:11    9            Is anybody sitting there thinking there's

11:19:13   10   something that I should have asked you, that if you were in

11:19:17   11   my shoes you would want me to know about you and your

11:19:20   12   service on this jury?      Can you raise your hand and let me

11:19:23   13   know that now?

11:19:25   14            Okay.   I don't see any hands at all.

11:19:27   15            I want to, again, say thank you to each of you

11:19:30   16   for -- for coming to jury service today.          It's a very

11:19:34   17   important part of what we're called to do as citizens, and

11:19:38   18   we can't thank you enough.       And I appreciate your attention

11:19:40   19   this morning.

11:19:41   20            Thank you, Your Honor.

11:19:43   21            THE COURT:     Thank you, counsel.

11:19:44   22            All right.     Ladies and gentlemen, at this time,

11:19:46   23   there are certain matters that I need to discuss with

11:19:50   24   counsel outside of your presence.

11:19:52   25            And given our safety protocols, I'm not going to

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 100 of 125 PageID #: 18436
                                                                                    100



11:19:56    1   ask you to leave me, I'm going to leave you.          I'm going to

11:20:00    2   get up and ask the court reporter to come with me, and I'm

11:20:03    3   going to ask Ms. Truelove and Mr. Dacus to join me in the

11:20:07    4   jury room.

11:20:08    5             I'll take up with them outside of your presence

11:20:11    6   those things I need to discuss without you being present,

11:20:14    7   and then I'll be back in the courtroom and give you further

11:20:17    8   instructions.

11:20:18    9             While I'm out of the courtroom, please keep your

11:20:20   10   seats.    If you'd like to visit quietly with someone in the

11:20:24   11   general vicinity, that's fine.       If you'd like to sit there

11:20:28   12   quietly and not visit with somebody around you, that's

11:20:31   13   fine, as well.     It's strictly up to you.

11:20:32   14             If you choose to have a conversation with anyone,

11:20:35   15   remember, don't talk about anything that's happened in the

11:20:39   16   courtroom this morning so far.       Nobody has heard any

11:20:43   17   evidence in this case whatsoever.

11:20:46   18             The -- the process won't take me long in the jury

11:20:51   19   room.    I expect to be back here in a few minutes, and then

11:20:56   20   I'll give you further instructions about how we proceed

11:20:59   21   from there.     But in the meantime, if you'll just maintain

11:21:04   22   your seats.     I want you to have some idea that I am coming

11:21:04   23   back.    I'm just not walking away.

11:21:04   24             All right.   Counsel, if you'll join me in the jury

11:21:09   25   room, please.

11:21:09    1           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

11:22:31    2           (Proceedings conducted in the jury room outside

11:22:48    3            the presence of the venire panel.)

11:22:48    4           THE COURT:     Ms. Truelove, do you have any

11:22:50    5   challenges for cause?

11:22:51    6           MS. TRUELOVE:     I do not, Your Honor.

11:22:53    7           THE COURT:     Okay.   Mr. Dacus, do you have any

11:22:57    8   challenges for cause?

11:22:58    9           MR. DACUS:     I challenge No. 3, Your Honor.

11:23:03   10           THE COURT:     All right.     In addition to questioning

11:23:21   11   these -- No. 3, who was challenged for cause by

11:23:26   12   Defendant -- is that your only challenge for cause?

11:23:28   13           MR. DACUS:     Yes, Your Honor.

11:23:29   14           THE COURT:     Okay.   In addition to questioning

11:23:31   15   No. 3, I'm going to also bring back and Question No. 12.

11:23:37   16           There apparently is some uncertainty about whether

11:23:40   17   she lives in the Marshall Division.        She's got a P.O. Box

11:23:43   18   in Laneville, Texas, which is the south end of Rusk County.

11:23:47   19   And that's not -- that's in the Tyler Division.           But she

11:23:50   20   works in Marshall at the local Kroger grocery store.            So I

11:23:55   21   want to make sure she's a qualified juror before we leave

11:23:58   22   her on the panel.

11:23:59   23           In addition to that, I'm going to bring back

11:24:03   24   No. 23, Ms. Walker; No. 25, Ms. Greene; and No. 31,

11:24:16   25   Ms. Porter, who all indicated they had scheduling issues.

11:24:20    1             Let me ask you this, counsel:       With only one juror

11:24:31    2   challenged for cause and No. 12 having some question about

11:24:34    3   her qualification, we're not going to reach 23, 25, or 31,

11:24:42    4   are we?

11:24:43    5             MS. TRUELOVE:   We will not, Your Honor.

11:24:45    6             MR. DACUS:   No, sir.

11:24:46    7             THE COURT:   Okay.   So at this point, I don't see a

11:24:50    8   need to take the time to bring them back and discuss their

11:24:52    9   scheduling issues.     I'll just bring back No. 12 and No. 3.

11:24:57   10             Do either of you have a problem with that?

11:25:00   11             MR. DACUS:   No, Your Honor.

11:25:04   12             MS. TRUELOVE:   Not from Plaintiff.

11:25:05   13             THE COURT:   We'll go back in the courtroom, go

11:25:07   14   back on the record, I'll tell the panel what we're doing,

11:25:09   15   and then we'll come back in here and I'll have the Court

11:25:13   16   Security Officer bring in No. 3 and No. 12 separately so

11:25:17   17   that we can visit with them about the challenge for cause,

11:25:19   18   and I can visit with No. 12 about her residence.           Thank

11:25:25   19   you.

11:26:20   23             Mr. Elliott, do we have all the members of the

11:26:42   24   venire panel in the courtroom?

11:26:47    1   is gone.

11:26:48    2              THE COURT:   All right.    We'll wait for Mr. Green.

11:28:41    3              All right.   Ladies and gentlemen, there are a few

11:28:46    4   of you that I am going to need to talk with outside of the

11:28:50    5   presence of the rest of the panel.        And I will talk with

11:28:53    6   you with Ms. Truelove and Mr. Dacus present in the jury

11:28:58    7   room.    We are going to go back and be in the jury room in

11:29:04    8   just a minute.

11:29:05    9              I'll have the Court Security Officer come in and

11:29:09   10   bring in one at a time those members of the panel that I

11:29:12   11   need to speak with.     It's just a couple members of the

11:29:17   12   panel.     I don't think it will take long.

11:29:20   13              The same rules apply while I'm off the bench and

11:29:23   14   out of the courtroom.     You're free to have a quiet

11:29:27   15   conversation with somebody near you if you'd like.            You're

11:29:29   16   not required to.

11:29:30   17              If you do, don't discuss anything about what's

11:29:32   18   happened in court today or since you got to the courthouse

11:29:35   19   this morning.

11:29:35   20              And there will also be an opportunity for the

11:29:43   21   Court Security Officers to see if anybody needs a restroom

11:29:46   22   break.

11:29:47   23              Part of the challenge we have in selecting a jury

11:29:50   24   for an in-person trial in our present circumstances is,

11:29:54   25   ordinarily, I would just say you all are recessed, and you

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 104 of 125 PageID #: 18440
                                                                                    104



11:29:57    1   can all walk out the backdoor together, and whoever needs a

11:30:00    2   restroom can go to it.     Whoever doesn't, doesn't.        We

11:30:03    3   obviously can't do that in today's world.

11:30:06    4           So while I'm off the bench, there'll be a chance,

11:30:10    5   if you need to, to one at a time with the work -- with the

11:30:13    6   help of the CSOs, the Court Security Officers, be excused

11:30:18    7   for a restroom break.     I'll be back on the bench fairly

11:30:22    8   soon, and then we'll proceed from there.

11:30:26    9           Again, while I'm out of the courtroom, don't

11:30:28   10   discuss anything that's happened since you've arrived at

11:30:31   11   the courthouse this morning.

11:30:32   12           All right.     Counsel, if you'll meet me in the jury

11:30:37   13   room at this time.

11:30:38   14           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

11:32:18   15           (Proceedings in the jury room outside the presence

11:33:04   16            of the venire panel.)

11:33:04   17           THE COURT:     Would you ask him to bring in Panel

11:33:20   18   Member No. 3, please?

11:33:28   19           (Juror brought into the jury room.)

11:33:28   20           Come in, Mr. Wallace.

11:33:55   21           JUROR WALLACE:      Hi, y'all.

11:33:56   22           THE COURT:     If you'd have a seat right there.

11:33:59   23           JUROR WALLACE:      Yes, sir.

11:34:01   24           THE COURT:     I'm pretty confident you can guess

11:34:03   25   that part of why you're back here is so we can inquire as

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 105 of 125 PageID #: 18441
                                                                                    105



11:34:06    1   to your ability to be fair and impartial.

11:34:08    2             JUROR WALLACE:    Yes, sir.

11:34:09    3             THE COURT:   It's not anything about the fact that

11:34:11    4   you are an officer of the court or a trained lawyer, but

11:34:17    5   you've indicated that not only do you know Judge Parish

11:34:24    6   professionally and have for some time, but you know her

11:34:30    7   socially and personally and consider her a close, personal

11:34:33    8   friend.

11:34:34    9             Her husband is on the Plaintiff's trial team and

11:34:36   10   in the courtroom and going to be here throughout the trial.

11:34:38   11   What level of participation in the trial he's going to

11:34:41   12   undertake, I don't know.      But I'm sure some level of

11:34:44   13   participation in the trial.

11:34:45   14             So that being the case, I need you to tell me,

11:34:49   15   again, that you're confident that you can completely put

11:34:53   16   out of your mind and remove from any part of your service

11:34:57   17   as a potential juror in this case that friendship and that

11:35:01   18   long association, the fact that you're going to be back in

11:35:05   19   Gilmer seeing Judge Parish in the community, perhaps

11:35:08   20   socially after this, and how you might feel if you end up

11:35:13   21   on a jury that comes back with a verdict that disappoints

11:35:17   22   her husband.

11:35:18   23             JUROR WALLACE:    Right.

11:35:19   24             THE COURT:   So what can you tell me about your

11:35:21   25   ability to do what is I think pretty clearly a difficult --

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 106 of 125 PageID #: 18442
                                                                                    106



11:35:26    1   a difficult thing?

11:35:28    2           JUROR WALLACE:      I would acknowledge that that's a

11:35:30    3   difficult thing, but I know, you know, professionally what

11:35:33    4   I'm called upon to do.

11:35:36    5           Since I got my license in 1992, you know,

11:35:39    6   sometimes you have to make hard decisions, and sometimes

11:35:42    7   that upsets people that you know.        Sometimes it upsets

11:35:49    8   people that are in your own family, but you still have to

11:35:53    9   do your job.   And I'm very keen on doing my job.

11:35:59   10           So I know as an officer of the court, that's one

11:36:03   11   thing -- I took that very seriously when I was a juror

11:36:07   12   on -- in Judge Parish's court actually.         She was a

11:36:11   13   presiding judge in a case that I ended up being a

11:36:15   14   foreperson over that jury and returned a verdict for

11:36:18   15   Plaintiff in that one.

11:36:19   16           But, you know, that -- that's -- it is very

11:36:29   17   important to me whether -- as an officer of the court,

11:36:32   18   whether I'm serving on a jury, whether I'm standing watch

11:36:35   19   on the USS Independence, or whether I was cooking chicken

11:36:40   20   for the Colonel many, many years ago.         Do my job.    So I

11:36:43   21   don't know how to say that any plainer to you or y'all.             If

11:36:50   22   it's my job, I'm going to do my job.

11:36:53   23           THE COURT:     All right.     I have one other question

11:36:54   24   I'm going to ask and then I'm going to let counsel ask any

11:36:59   25   question they want to.     But my other question is this:

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 107 of 125 PageID #: 18443
                                                                                    107



11:37:02    1   Assume that you're on the jury, assume that you're the only

11:37:05    2   lawyer on the jury, assume you've heard all the evidence in

11:37:08    3   the case, and counsel's made their closing arguments and I

11:37:14    4   send the eight of you back into this jury room to

11:37:17    5   deliberate on the verdict, and the other seven jurors sit

11:37:20    6   down around this table, the first question to answer on the

11:37:23    7   verdict form comes up, and they all look at you and say,

11:37:26    8   you're a lawyer, Mr. Wallace, what should we do?

11:37:30    9           JUROR WALLACE:      That's not my job.

11:37:31   10           THE COURT:     Are you going to make sure that each

11:37:33   11   juror -- if you're among the jury, are you going to avoid

11:37:37   12   becoming a jury of one?     And are you going to not fall into

11:37:41   13   the easy trap of telling everybody else what to do, but

11:37:44   14   make sure they all make their own independent decisions?

11:37:47   15           JUROR WALLACE:      I think that would violate my oath

11:37:49   16   if I started doing that, and I'm not going to do that.

11:37:51   17           THE COURT:     Okay.   And you understand why I ask

11:37:53   18   the question?

11:37:54   19           JUROR WALLACE:      Yes, sir, I do.      I understand.

11:37:56   20           THE COURT:     Mr. Dacus, do you have any questions

11:37:58   21   of Mr. Wallace?

11:38:00   22           MR. DACUS:     Nothing, Your Honor.

11:38:01   23           THE COURT:     Ms. Truelove?

11:38:02   24           MS. TRUELOVE:     I have nothing, Your Honor.

11:38:04   25           THE COURT:     All right.     Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

                                                                                    108



11:38:07    1             JUROR WALLACE:    Thank you, Judge.

11:38:11    2             (Juror excused to return to the courtroom.)

11:38:11    3             THE COURT:   All right.     I'm going to do --

11:38:14    4   overrule the challenge for cause as to Mr. Wallace.

11:38:17    5             And, if you will, Ms. Lockhart, ask the Court

11:38:23    6   Security Officer to bring back Panel Member No. 12,

11:38:27    7   Ms. Wheeler.

11:39:06    8             (Juror brought into the jury room.)

11:39:06    9             THE COURT:   Come in, Ms. Wheeler.       Would you come

11:42:01   10   up and have a seat right here, please, ma'am?

11:42:07   11             I just have a simple question I need to ask to

11:42:09   12   clarify something, Ms. Wheeler.       I know you work here in

11:42:12   13   Marshall at Kroger.     I've been buying groceries there for

11:42:18   14   35 years.

11:42:18   15             But according to our information, you have a post

11:42:22   16   office box in Laneville, and Laneville is in the south end

11:42:26   17   corner of Rusk County, and Rusk County is not in the

11:42:29   18   Marshall Division.     Do you live in Laneville?

11:42:32   19             JUROR WHEELER:    No.   I share the P.O. Box with my

11:42:34   20   sister.

11:42:35   21             THE COURT:   And where is your actual residence?

11:42:38   22             JUROR WHEELER:    Here in Marshall on Fairview

11:42:42   23   Street.

11:42:42   24             THE COURT:   That's all I needed to know.         Thank

11:42:43   25   you, ma'am.

11:42:44    1            JUROR WHEELER:     You're welcome.

11:42:47    2            (Juror excused to return to the courtroom.)

11:42:47    3            THE COURT:    All right.     We'll leave Ms. Wheeler on

11:42:52    4   the venire list, and we'll leave Mr. Wallace on the list.

11:42:56    5            How long do you all need to exercise your

11:43:01    6   peremptory challenges?

11:43:02    7            MR. DACUS:    20 minutes.

11:43:04    8            THE COURT:    I'll give you until 10 minutes after

11:43:06    9   12:00.

11:43:08   10            MR. DACUS:    Thank you.

11:43:08   11            MS. TRUELOVE:    Okay.     Great.   Thank you,

11:43:12   12   Your Honor.

11:43:12   13            MR. DACUS:    We'll strike through 16.

11:43:14   14            MS. TRUELOVE:    We'll strike through 16.

11:43:17   15            THE COURT:    Right.

11:44:08   16            MS. TRUELOVE:    Thank you.

11:44:08   17            THE COURT:    Let's go back on the record, and I'll

11:44:08   18   tell everyone what we're doing.

11:44:08   19            (Conference concluded in jury room.)

11:44:08   20            (The Court is back on the Bench - Open court.)

11:44:09   21            THE COURT:    Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for

11:44:10   22   your forbearance and cooperation.        I'm going to recess in

11:44:14   23   just a minute so that the lawyers can exercise their

11:44:17   24   peremptory challenges, which is part of the process of

11:44:20   25   securing the eight of you that will be the jurors in this

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 110 of 125 PageID #: 18446
                                                                                    110



11:44:23    1   case.    That's going to take about 20 or 25 minutes.

11:44:27    2             While we're in recess, I'm going to need all of

11:44:31    3   you to stay in your seats.      We don't want to completely

11:44:35    4   frustrate the social distancing we've worked hard to

11:44:39    5   achieve this morning.

11:44:40    6             We'll follow the same course that we followed when

11:44:44    7   I was off the bench and in the jury room.         If you'd like,

11:44:44    8   please feel free to have a conversation with anyone near

11:44:48    9   you, if you're comfortable doing that, as long as it's

11:44:49   10   quiet and respectful.     You are in a court of law.

11:44:52   11             Don't discuss anything about what's happened since

11:44:55   12   you've arrived at the courthouse today or anything you've

11:44:57   13   heard.

11:44:59   14             Also, given the length of time here, we'll

11:45:02   15   continue, through our Court Security Officers, to see who

11:45:04   16   may need to leave one at a time or in small groups for

11:45:09   17   restroom breaks.

11:45:10   18             Also, ladies and gentlemen, it's a quarter until

11:45:12   19   12:00.    It's going to be probably 12:30 or so before I can

11:45:18   20   possibly be back in here, and I am concerned that some of

11:45:24   21   you might not do well if you don't have something to eat

11:45:29   22   right at 12:00 noon.

11:45:31   23             So I've instructed the clerk's office to have

11:45:33   24   peanut butter crackers and bottled water available.            While

11:45:38   25   I'm off the bench, if you would like some crackers and some

                                                                                    111



11:45:41    1   water, if you'll let the Court Security Officers know,

11:45:44    2   they'll see that it's brought in to you one at a time.

11:45:47    3            If you don't care for that, don't feel any need to

11:45:49    4   do it.   But I do want to make it available to you, against

11:45:52    5   the prospect that some of you would feel better if you had

11:45:56    6   something to eat past the noon hour.

11:45:59    7            So with all those instructions, please maintain

11:46:03    8   your social distancing in your seats, follow the

11:46:05    9   instructions that I've given you, and I'll be back here as

11:46:08   10   soon as I can to continue with the process.

11:46:11   11            The Court stands in recess.

11:46:12   12            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

11:46:15   13            (Recess.)

12:25:04   14            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

12:25:12   15            THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

12:25:16   16            All right.    Ladies and gentlemen, if you will

12:25:19   17   listen carefully.     As your name is called, if you'll come

12:25:21   18   forward and take your position in the jury box.

12:25:24   19            I'm going to ask that of our eight jurors that are

12:25:28   20   selected, that the first four be positioned on the front

12:25:31   21   row of the jury box, and the second four on the second row

12:25:35   22   of the jury box.

12:25:37   23            You'll also find a plastic face shield in the

12:25:44   24   chairs up there.     I mentioned that earlier.       What I'd like

12:25:48   25   you to do is stand in front of a chair that has a plastic

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 112 of 125 PageID #: 18448
                                                                                    112



12:25:54    1   face shield in it.    When everybody's in place, then I'll

12:25:58    2   ask you to all be seated, and if you'll pick up that

12:26:01    3   plastic face shield and have a seat, that should position

12:26:05    4   you as well as we can and as socially distanced as we can

12:26:09    5   in the jury box.

12:26:09    6           All right.     I'm going to ask our courtroom deputy,

12:26:13    7   Ms. Lockhart, to announce the name of our eight -- names of

12:26:16    8   our jurors at this time.

12:26:18    9           COURTROOM DEPUTY:      Ellen Banks, Elizabeth Edwards,

12:26:26   10   Dyan Burton, Angela Friday, William Amick, Ashley

12:26:52   11   Stansbury -- bury, Tracie Huskey, and James Smith.

12:27:13   12           THE COURT:     Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

12:27:33   13   Please be seated.

12:27:33   14           Those of you who were not selected for the jury in

12:27:43   15   this case, I'm about to excuse you at this time.           But I

12:27:47   16   want to say this before I excuse you:         Everybody in this

12:27:52   17   courtroom, the Court, the Court staff, the parties, counsel

12:27:56   18   for both of the parties, everyone here appreciates the

12:28:00   19   sacrifice that each of you made to be here this morning and

12:28:03   20   to present yourself for jury duty.        And even though you

12:28:06   21   weren't selected, you performed a very real and significant

12:28:09   22   and important public service by being here.

12:28:13   23           It is not lost on any of us that every one of you

12:28:17   24   had other places to be today, things to do that were

12:28:20   25   important in your respective lives, and you set that aside,

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 113 of 125 PageID #: 18449
                                                                                    113



12:28:24    1   and you sacrificed and came and presented yourselves, as

12:28:27    2   you were called upon to do as good citizens.

12:28:30    3           Quite honestly, ladies and gentlemen, the Court

12:28:33    4   could not function and discharge its duties under the

12:28:41    5   Constitution without ordinary citizens such as yourselves

12:28:43    6   doing what you've done this morning, putting your other

12:28:46    7   responsibilities and the other important things in your

12:28:49    8   lives on hold and presenting yourself for jury duty.

12:28:53    9           We can't thank you enough.        Believe me, we

12:28:57   10   appreciate you more than I can express this morning, and I

12:29:00   11   want you to know that, on behalf of everybody here, before

12:29:02   12   you leave.

12:29:03   13           Also, as you leave, if you will go by the clerk's

12:29:06   14   office, they want to retrieve those very expensive numbers

12:29:09   15   you have pinned to your garments.        They also will answer

12:29:12   16   any questions you have.

12:29:14   17           If you need any kind of a document to show to an

12:29:17   18   employer, to explain where you have been this morning,

12:29:21   19   they'll assist you with that, and they'll take any other

12:29:24   20   questions you have and assist you in any other way they

12:29:29   21   can.

12:29:29   22           Again, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so very

12:29:32   23   much for the important role you played in being here today.

12:29:33   24           Those on the panel not selected as members of the

12:29:37   25   jury are now excused.

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 114 of 125 PageID #: 18450
                                                                                    114



12:29:42    1            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

12:30:23    2            (Unselected venire panel members out.)

12:30:28    3            THE COURT:    All right.     I'd like to ask everyone

12:30:30    4   but the members of the jury to be seated, please.

12:30:32    5            Members of the jury, I'm going to ask

12:30:34    6   Ms. Lockhart, our courtroom deputy, to administer the oath

12:30:37    7   as jurors to you now.

12:30:39    8            (Jurors sworn.)

12:30:43    9            THE COURT:    Please have a seat.

12:30:56   10            Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to excuse you for

12:31:01   11   lunch.   I'm told by the clerk's office that your lunch is

12:31:05   12   in the jury room and available to you.

12:31:07   13            But before I do, I need to go over a few brief

12:31:11   14   things with you.

12:31:11   15            First of all, during the lunch break, please make

12:31:16   16   sure that you give to Ms. Clendening a good working cell

12:31:20   17   phone number for each of you.       If there were any reason why

12:31:24   18   we would need to get you before you were to appear the next

12:31:28   19   day, we would need a good number where we could reach you.

12:31:31   20            I know that several of you have a good distance to

12:31:33   21   drive to get to the courthouse from where you live, and

12:31:35   22   it's not likely, but if we needed to reach you before you

12:31:38   23   arrived or overnight, we'd like to have that number.

12:31:42   24            Also, let me give you a couple instructions that

12:31:47   25   I'm expecting you to follow and that are important enough

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 115 of 125 PageID #: 18451
                                                                                    115



12:31:50    1   I'm going to give them to you now and not wait until after

12:31:54    2   lunch.

12:31:54    3             First of all, do not discuss this case with

12:31:57    4   anyone.   Do not discuss this case with anyone.          And when I

12:32:01    5   say "discuss," I mean communicate about the case or

12:32:09    6   anything related to it, in the broadest sense possible.

12:32:13    7             Let me explain this to you.       At the end of the

12:32:15    8   trial when all the evidence has been presented and I've

12:32:18    9   given you my final instructions on the law that you are to

12:32:21   10   follow and counsel for the two parties have presented their

12:32:23   11   closing arguments to you, I'm going to instruct you to

12:32:27   12   retire to the jury room and to deliberate on your verdict.

12:32:29   13             The verdict is going to be a list of questions

12:32:31   14   that you will need to answer, and your answers to those

12:32:35   15   questions will have to be unanimous.

12:32:40   16             However, it is absolutely essential and

12:32:41   17   fundamental to this process that the only information you

12:32:46   18   have to draw upon in answering those questions in the

12:32:49   19   verdict form must come to you solely and only through the

12:32:54   20   evidence that's presented in this trial.

12:32:56   21             And that means the sworn testimony of the

12:32:58   22   witnesses presented, subject to cross-examination, and the

12:33:03   23   exhibits and other documents that the Court has found to be

12:33:07   24   admissible under the Rules of Evidence and has admitted as

12:33:12   25   exhibits in this case.

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 116 of 125 PageID #: 18452
                                                                                    116



12:33:13    1           Those things must be the sole universe of the

12:33:16    2   information that you draw upon to answer those questions in

12:33:19    3   the verdict form.

12:33:20    4           If you have other information from any other

12:33:23    5   source that's involved in you answering any of those

12:33:27    6   questions, then that will jeopardize the entire process and

12:33:32    7   result in us probably having to start over with another

12:33:35    8   jury and use all the time and resources again that have

12:33:39    9   been dedicated to this trial.

12:33:40   10           So all the instructions I'm going to give you,

12:33:44   11   ladies and gentlemen, are important.        This one is number

12:33:47   12   one for a reason, and it's so important that you're going

12:33:50   13   to hear this repeat -- repeated by me throughout the trial.

12:33:57   14           As a matter of fact, most jurors are sick and

12:33:59   15   tired of hearing this from me by the time the trial is

12:34:02   16   over, but I'm going to continue to repeat it.          Pretty much

12:34:06   17   any time you get out of those chairs, you're going to hear

12:34:09   18   that from me, because it is that critical and that

12:34:11   19   important that the sole and only source of information you

12:34:13   20   have to draw upon to answer the questions that will be

12:34:16   21   asked of you in the verdict must come only and solely from

12:34:19   22   the sworn testimony presented in court and the exhibits

12:34:22   23   that the Court introduces.

12:34:25   24           And when I say don't discuss the case

12:34:28   25   among your -- among -- with anyone, rather, that means

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 117 of 125 PageID #: 18453
                                                                                    117



12:34:31    1   among yourselves, too.     And until all the evidence is in,

12:34:36    2   until I've given you my final instructions, and until I

12:34:40    3   have directed you to retire and deliberate on your verdict,

12:34:45    4   you must not discuss anything or communicate in any way

12:34:49    5   about this case with, not only everybody else, but among

12:34:53    6   the eight of you, as well.

12:34:54    7           Now, at that point when you have heard all the

12:34:57    8   evidence, when I've given you my final instructions, when

12:35:00    9   counsel have presented their closing arguments, and when I

12:35:04   10   have instructed you to retire to the jury room and to

12:35:06   11   deliberate on your verdict, at that moment, but not an

12:35:12   12   instant before, but at that moment, it becomes your duty to

12:35:16   13   discuss this case and the evidence among the eight of you

12:35:19   14   so that you can arrive at unanimous answers to those

12:35:22   15   questions that will be in the verdict form.

12:35:24   16           But until that point in time, you are not to

12:35:28   17   communicate in any way or discuss anything about the case

12:35:32   18   with each other or anyone else.

12:35:35   19           And when I say -- when I say "discuss" or

12:35:40   20   "communicate," I mean those words in the broadest sense of

12:35:44   21   the term.   That's not only oral communications.          That's

12:35:47   22   written communications.     That's digital communications.

12:35:50   23   That's electronic communications.

12:35:54   24           If any of you on the jury are users of social

12:35:58   25   media, don't post on Facebook, don't tweet on Twitter,

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 118 of 125 PageID #: 18454
                                                                                    118



12:36:02    1   don't use Instagram, or any other possible social media

12:36:07    2   platform to communicate or discuss anything about the case.

12:36:12    3            Also, you're not to do any research about this

12:36:17    4   case in any shape, form, or fashion.        That means you are

12:36:20    5   not to get on the Internet and do a search for Amazon or

12:36:26    6   Vocalife or any of the lawyers or any of the witnesses or

12:36:29    7   anything you hear about in the case.

12:36:32    8            You're not to -- you're not to research anything

12:36:35    9   about this in any way.     That involve -- that means online.

12:36:39   10   That means if you happen to be in a library, don't pull an

12:36:43   11   encyclopedia off the shelf and do it that way.           Don't do

12:36:46   12   any research whatsoever.

12:36:47   13            Again, it all comes back to this fundamental

12:36:54   14   principle, that the sole source of the information you'll

12:36:56   15   have to draw upon to answer the questions in the verdict

12:36:58   16   form at the end of the trial must be limited and solely

12:37:03   17   confined to the witnesses who've testified under oath and

12:37:08   18   subject to cross-examination and the exhibits introduced

12:37:11   19   into evidence and approved as fully admissible by the

12:37:16   20   Court.   That's it.   And that is the fundamental basis upon

12:37:20   21   which this trial must go forward.        So don't do any research

12:37:23   22   of any kind.

12:37:23   23            As a matter of fact, ladies and gentlemen, if any

12:37:26   24   of you have smartphones with you, those are little

12:37:29   25   computers that also allow you to make telephone calls.              I'm

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 119 of 125 PageID #: 18455
                                                                                    119



12:37:32    1   going to ask that beginning tomorrow, if you have

12:37:36    2   smartphones, if you have tablets, iPads, any kind of

12:37:40    3   electronic devices, if you have Apple watches that you can

12:37:43    4   do Internet searches on, leave all those electronic devices

12:37:48    5   either at home or leave them in your automobiles outside

12:37:52    6   the courtroom, but don't bring them in the courthouse.

12:37:58    7            It's sometimes tempting for jurors to, quote,

12:38:02    8   Google something real quick when they don't understand it,

12:38:04    9   and that's not proper, and that's not permissible.

12:38:07   10            So to remove the temptation, don't bring any

12:38:11   11   electronic devices into the courthouse starting tomorrow.

12:38:14   12   If you have them today, that's fine.        Leave them where you

12:38:14   13   have them, but don't bring anything into the courthouse

12:38:17   14   tomorrow that would fit in that category or would provide

12:38:19   15   that kind of temptation.

12:38:20   16            Also, ladies and gentlemen, during the course of

12:38:24   17   this trial, there are going to be times as you come in the

12:38:29   18   morning, you leave in the evenings, at other times, you are

12:38:34   19   going to come in relatively close contact to some of the

12:38:37   20   lawyers, some of the witnesses, some of the support staff,

12:38:41   21   the corporate representatives for these companies, other

12:38:44   22   people associated with this trial.

12:38:45   23            When that happens, they're not going to talk to

12:38:50   24   you.   They're not going to speak.       They're not going to say

12:38:53   25   good morning.   They're not going to say, how are you today?

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 120 of 125 PageID #: 18456
                                                                                    120



12:38:56    1   They're not going to be friendly.        They're not going to be

12:39:00    2   engaging.   They're not going to be gregarious as we often

12:39:04    3   are in East Texas.

12:39:06    4           That's because I've instructed them not to be.

12:39:08    5   That's because the only communications that you should have

12:39:10    6   to draw on are the ones that come under oath in open court.

12:39:14    7           So when you walk by one of these lawyers coming

12:39:18    8   into the courthouse in the morning or you see one of the

12:39:21    9   witnesses and you walk by or are in close proximity to them

12:39:21   10   and they don't speak and they're not friendly and they're

12:39:24   11   not outgoing, don't hold that against them.          Don't think

12:39:27   12   they're being rude.    Don't consider that anything to be

12:39:32   13   negative in any way because they're simply doing what the

12:39:36   14   Court's instructed them to do.

12:39:37   15           Also, ladies and gentlemen, I think that I should

12:39:41   16   make sure that you understand this.        It is possible over

12:39:46   17   the course of this trial that some outside person, some

12:39:51   18   outside source might try to contact you about your service

12:39:55   19   as jurors and the ultimate decisions that you will make.             I

12:40:01   20   don't think that's likely.

12:40:02   21           But let me just say, ladies and gentlemen, there

12:40:04   22   are no unimportant cases that get to trial in a United

12:40:09   23   States District Court.

12:40:09   24           And if anywhere along the way anybody attempts to

12:40:12   25   contact you or has any interaction with you that you feel

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 121 of 125 PageID #: 18457
                                                                                    121



12:40:16    1   is inappropriate or not what it should be in any way, then

12:40:21    2   you should immediately inform Ms. Clendening.          She will let

12:40:25    3   me know, and the Court will deal with it.

12:40:29    4           Again, I don't think that's likely, but it is

12:40:30    5   within the realm of possibility, and so I at least want to

12:40:33    6   put you on notice about it.

12:40:35    7           Also, ladies and gentlemen -- and I'll give you

12:40:39    8   more instructions on this after lunch -- but so you will

12:40:42    9   know for planning purposes, it's always been my experience

12:40:46   10   since I've been a United States District Judge, that

12:40:50   11   jurors, especially in our division, which includes six

12:40:53   12   counties and covers a lot of geographic area, would rather

12:40:57   13   get here early and stay late and be away from their homes

12:41:01   14   and their families and their work fewer days than come

12:41:04   15   late, break early, and take a longer number of days to try

12:41:07   16   the case.

12:41:08   17           So I am anticipating that we will start each

12:41:15   18   morning about 8:30.    And I'm going to ask you each evening

12:41:19   19   when you leave to be sure you're back the next day,

12:41:23   20   assembled in the jury room, and ready to go by 8:30.            And

12:41:27   21   we're not going to stop at 5:00 on the dot.          We won't run

12:41:32   22   this trial, as they say, like banker's hours.          And I can't

12:41:36   23   tell you exactly when we will stop each day.

12:41:38   24           Some of these witnesses that you're going to hear

12:41:40   25   may be on the witness stand an hour, sometimes two hours,

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 122 of 125 PageID #: 18458
                                                                                    122



12:41:44    1   sometimes there are lengthy testimonies to be given, and

12:41:48    2   it's always heard to break a witness in the middle of their

12:41:52    3   testimony.

12:41:53    4           So depending on exactly how things fall, we'll

12:41:56    5   work each evening until probably not earlier than 5:30,

12:42:00    6   maybe 6:00 o'clock.    In some rare cases, maybe a little

12:42:04    7   later than 6:00 o'clock.

12:42:05    8           But I want to give you a general idea of what to

12:42:10    9   expect so those who may be waiting for you at home each

12:42:13   10   evening have an idea of when you'll be on the road and when

12:42:17   11   you'll be back at your homes.

12:42:18   12           Let me tell you one other thing relating back to

12:42:22   13   this first instruction that I gave you.         Unless you live

12:42:26   14   alone, whenever you get home tonight, wherever that is,

12:42:29   15   whoever is there when you get home, I guarantee the first

12:42:34   16   thing you're going to hear from them is, tell me what

12:42:37   17   happened in federal court in Marshall today.

12:42:39   18           Don't even try to answer that question, because if

12:42:42   19   you do, no matter how you try to answer it, you're going to

12:42:45   20   violate the instruction that I've given you.

12:42:48   21           So when that happens, and I promise you it will,

12:42:51   22   unless you live alone, just look at whoever it is and say,

12:42:58   23   that very stern Federal Judge told me not to talk about

12:43:01   24   this case with anyone, and that's what I'm going to do.             He

12:43:04   25   also told me that when this trial is over and when I was no

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 123 of 125 PageID #: 18459
                                                                                    123



12:43:07    1   longer a juror in the case, I'd be free to talk about it

12:43:07    2   with anybody that I chose to talk about it with.

12:43:10    3           But don't even try to answer that question when

12:43:13    4   you get home tonight, because I promise you, unless you

12:43:16    5   live alone, somebody's going to ask you that question.            And

12:43:18    6   if you try to answer it, you'll violate that first

12:43:21    7   instruction that I've given you.

12:43:22    8           All right.     Ladies and gentlemen, it's roughly 15

12:43:27    9   minutes until 1:00.    Your lunches are in the courtroom --

12:43:31   10   excuse me, in the jury room, as I said.         I'm going to do

12:43:37   11   our best to start back at 1:30.       And please follow all the

12:43:40   12   instructions I've given you.

12:43:41   13           Also, while you're on lunch break, if you'll open

12:43:44   14   those plastic face shields.      One thing I need to remind you

12:43:48   15   of, there's a plastic film that protects the face shield on

12:43:52   16   the front and the back.     Please be sure you peel off that

12:43:56   17   plastic film, or you'll do like I did the first time I put

12:44:01   18   one on, everything will look blurry and smeared.           So don't

12:44:06   19   put it on without removing the film that protects the

12:44:06   20   plastic shield.

12:44:08   21           And then, if you will, please wear that in place

12:44:09   22   of your mask when you come back in after lunch.

12:44:12   23           If anybody on the jury has a very strong personal

12:44:16   24   conviction that they should keep their mask on, I'm not

12:44:18   25   going to make you take it off.       But, again, it's very

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 124 of 125 PageID #: 18460
                                                                                    124



12:44:21    1   difficult for the lawyers to try this case the way they

12:44:25    2   should unless they have the benefit of seeing each of you

12:44:28    3   and have the ability to judge whether what they're trying

12:44:31    4   to get across is -- is getting home and whether it's

12:44:34    5   getting across to you or not.       And a lot of that is them

12:44:36    6   reading you over the course of the trial.

12:44:38    7            So, if at all possible, please wear those face

12:44:42    8   shields instead of your mask when you come back in after

12:44:44    9   lunch.

12:44:44   10            All right.    With those instructions, ladies and

12:44:47   11   gentlemen, you are excused for lunch.

12:44:48   12            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

12:44:49   13            (Jury out.)

12:44:50   14            THE COURT:    Any questions from either Plaintiff or

12:45:24   15   Defendant before we recess for lunch?

12:45:26   16            MS. TRUELOVE:    Nothing from Plaintiff, Your Honor.

12:45:28   17            MR. DACUS:    No, Your Honor.

12:45:29   18            THE COURT:    Over the break, feel free to bring

12:45:32   19   your remaining trial teams up and get positioned.           And I'll

12:45:39   20   begin with my preliminary instructions to the jury at 1:30.

12:45:44   21            The Court stands in recess.
