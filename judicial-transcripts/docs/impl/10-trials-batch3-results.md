### ⚠️ Known Issues

#### Trial 22 (Core Wireless V. Apple)
- **Issue**: Needs ")" delimiter configuration
- **Pattern**: Non-standard summary delimiter

- **Issue**: Complex delimiter pattern previously identified
- **Pattern**: Unusual formatting in summary section

#### Witness Resolution
- **Issue**: "Unable to resolve A speaker - no current witness" warnings throughout Phase 2
- **Cause**: Answer patterns in trialstyle.json don't match transcript format
- **User Feedback**: "These are known patterns - I have spec'd out solutions"
- **Fix**: Will be addressed via trialstyle.json customization

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Trials**: 10
- **Total Sessions**: 89
- **Total Events Processed**: 52,176

- **Success Rate**: 50% (5/10 trials had events processed in Phase 2)

## Next Steps
1. Configure delimiter overrides for trials 22 and 32
2. Continue testing with next batch of 10 trials
3. Apply trialstyle.json customizations for witness resolution patterns

## Conclusion
Batch 3 shows consistent Phase 1 parsing success (100%) but Phase 2 event processing succeeded for only 50% of trials. The witness resolution issues are known and will be addressed through trialstyle.json customization as per the user's specifications.
