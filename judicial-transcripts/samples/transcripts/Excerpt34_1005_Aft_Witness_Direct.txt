03:39:32   23   BY MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:

03:39:32   24   Q.   Mr. Ratliff, please introduce yourself to the jury.

03:39:35   25   A.   Good afternoon.    My name is Alan Ratliff.        I live in

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 333 Filed 10/09/20 Page 86 of 120 PageID #: 19132
                                                                                     796



03:39:38    1   Houston, Texas.    I'm a partner in a consulting firm called

03:39:42    2   StoneTurn Group.     We have got about a dozen offices between

03:39:47    3   the U.S. and overseas.

03:39:48    4            The type of consulting we provide includes

03:39:51    5   financial investigations, evaluations, serving as experts

03:39:56    6   in litigation, certain types of government regulatory

03:40:00    7   investigation/consulting.

03:40:02    8            I'm married, my wife's name is Trisha.           We've been

03:40:06    9   married about a little over 30 years.         And she's an

03:40:09   10   assistant principal for a school for low-income kids in

03:40:15   11   East Houston.

03:40:15   12   Q.   What was your assignment in this case?

03:40:17   13   A.   To determine the amount of damages that Amazon would

03:40:20   14   owe to Vocalife if you, the jury, determine that there's

03:40:25   15   been infringement of the '049 patent, and that that patent

03:40:28   16   is not invalid.

03:40:30   17            So in the course of this, I'm going to assume

03:40:33   18   those things are true, in order to give you my damages

03:40:37   19   opinions, but you still have to determine those things.

03:40:39   20   Q.   Did you prepare some demonstrative slides to assist in

03:40:42   21   your presentation?

03:40:43   22   A.   I did.

03:41:02   23   Q.   Mr. Ratliff, tell the jury about your education.

03:41:05   24   A.   I did my undergraduate and graduate degrees at Baylor

03:41:11   25   University, business administration, accounting and tax.
