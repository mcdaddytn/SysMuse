2                   (Jury out.)

3                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

4                   THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

5                   All right.     Counsel, is there anything we need to

6      take up before I bring in the jury?            We had to wait just a

7      little bit to get all our jurors here, but I'm told we have all

8      eight in the jury room.

9                   MR. VERHOEVEN:      Nothing from Plaintiff.

10                   MR. PANKRATZ:      Your Honor, you asked us for an

11      agreement one way or the other of how to refer to the patents.

12      We have not reached an agreement.           We would propose that we use

13      the first three numbers -- or the last three digits.

14                   THE COURT:     Well, as I indicated in chambers this

15      morning, barring a mutual agreement between the parties, we'll

16      refer to the patents-in-suit by their last three numbers or the

17      title on the face of the patent.

18                   MR. PANKRATZ:      Thank you, Your Honor.

19                   THE COURT:     Okay.    Let's bring in the jury,

20      Mr. Johnston.

21                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise for the jury.

22                   (Jury in.)

23                   THE COURT:     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if

24      you'll remain standing when you come in, then I'll seat y'all

25      at one time.

1                   Now, that you're all in your seats, please -- or

2      y'all are all in your places, please be seated.

3                   Please be seated.

4                   Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

5                   We're going to try to keep this case running along

6      the timeline that I told you about during jury selection, but I

7      do have some preliminary instructions that I want to give you

8      this morning before we then start with opening statements from

9      each side and then get on to the evidence in the case.

10                   You've now been sworn as the jurors in this case, and

11      as the jury, you are the sole judges of the facts, and as such,

12      you will decide and determine what all the facts are in this

13      case.

14                   As the judge, I'll give you instructions on the law.

15      I'll decide questions of law, procedure, and evidence that

16      arise during the trial, but I'm also responsible for

17      maintaining the flow of the trial and preserving the decorum of

18      the courtroom.

19                   At the end of the evidence, I'll give you detailed

20      instructions about the law to apply in deciding the case, and

21      I'll give you a list of questions that are -- you are then to

22      answer.

23                   This list of questions is called the verdict form.

24      And your answers to those questions will need to be unanimous,

25      and those unanimous answers to those questions will constitute

1      the verdict in this case.

2                   And I want to briefly tell you what the case is

3      about.    As you know already, this case involves disputes

4      regarding certain United States patents.             And I know that you

5      all saw as a part of jury selection the patent film provided by

6      the Federal Judicial Center, but I want to give you some

7      instructions here now and on the record about a patent and how

8      one is obtained.

9                   Patents are either granted or denied by the United

10      States Patent and Trademark Office, which you will often hear

11      simply referred to by shorthand as the PTO.

12                   A valid United States patent gives the holder of that

13      patent the right, for up to 20 years from the date the patent

14      application is filed, to prevent others from making, using,

15      offering for sale, or selling the patented invention within the

16      United States or importing it into the United States without

17      the patentholder's permission.

18                   A patent is a form of property, and it's called

19      intellectual property.         Like other forms of property, a patent

20      can be bought and sold and transferred.

21                   A violation of a patentholder's rights is called

22      infringement.      A patentholder may try to enforce patents

23      against persons it believes to be infringers by filing a

24      lawsuit in federal court and that is exactly what we have in

25      this case.

1                   The process of obtaining a patent is called patent

2      prosecution.      To obtain a patent, one first files an

3      application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office,

4      again, for short, the PTO.          The PTO is an agency of the United

5      States Government that employs trained examiners who review

6      patents and review applications for patents.

7                   The application includes what is called a

8      specification.      The specification contains a written

9      description of the claimed invention telling what the invention

10      is, how it works, how to make it, and how to use it.

11                   The specification concludes or ends with one or more

12      numbered sentences.        These numbered sentences are called the

13      patent claims.      When a patent is granted by the Patent and

14      Trademark Office, the claims define the boundaries of its

15      protection and give notice to the public of those boundaries.

16                   Patent claims may exist in two forms referred to as

17      independent claims and dependent claims.

18                   An independent claim in a patent does not refer to

19      any other claim in the patent.           It's independent.       It's not

20      necessary to look to any other claim to determine what an

21      independent claim covers.

22                   However, a dependent claim refers to at least one

23      other claim in the patent.          A dependent claim includes each of

24      the elements or limitations of that other claim to which it

25      refers, as well as the additional limitations or elements
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 7 of 129 PageID #: 61292   7



1      recited within the dependent claim itself.

2                   Therefore, to determine what a dependent claim

3      covers, it's necessary to look to both the dependent claim and

4      the independent claim to which it refers or depends.

5                   The claims of the patents-in-suit use -- use the

6      words "comprises" and "comprising."

7                   Comprising means including or containing.             A claim

8      that includes the word "comprises" or "comprising" is not

9      limited to the methods or devices having only the elements that

10      are recited in the claim but also covers methods or devices

11      that add additional elements.

12                   Let me give you an example.         A claim that covers a

13      table, it may recite that -- that the table comprises a

14      tabletop, legs, and glue.         The claim -- there, the claim will

15      cover any table that contains these structures, even if the

16      table also contains other structures, such as a leaf or wheels

17      on the ends of the legs.

18                   That's a very simple example using the word

19      "comprising" and what it means.           In other words, ladies and

20      gentlemen, it can have other features in addition to those that

21      are covered by the patent.

22                   After the applicant files an application with the

23      PTO, an examiner reviews the application to determine whether

24      or not the claims are patentable, that is to say, appropriate

25      for patent protection, and whether or not the specification
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 8 of 129 PageID #: 61293   8



1      adequately describes the invention claimed.

2                   In examining a patent application, the examiner

3      reviews certain information about the state of the technology

4      at the time the application was filed.             The PTO searches for

5      and reviews this type of information that is publicly available

6      or that is submitted by the applicant.

7                   This type of information is called prior art.              The

8      examiner reviews this prior art to determine whether or not the

9      invention is truly an advance over the state of the art at the

10      time.

11                   Prior art's defined by law, and I'll give you, at a

12      later time, specific instructions as to what constitutes prior

13      art.    However, in general, prior art includes information that

14      demonstrates the state of the technology that existed before

15      the claimed invention was made or before the application for a

16      patent was filed.

17                   A patent contains a list of certain prior art that

18      the examiner has considered.          The items on this list of prior

19      art that the examiner has considered, as shown on the patent,

20      is called the stated -- excuse me -- the cited references.

21                   After a prior art search and examination of the

22      application, the examiner informs the applicant in writing of

23      what the examiner has found and whether the examiner considers

24      any claim to be patentable and thus would be allowed.

25                   This writing from the examiner is called an office
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 9 of 129 PageID #: 61294   9



1      action.     If the examiner rejects the claims, the applicant has

2      an opportunity to respond to the examiner to try to persuade

3      the examiner to allow the claims.           The applicant also has the

4      chance to change or amend the claims or to submit new claims.

5                   This process, ladies and gentlemen, may go back and

6      forth between the applicant and the examiner for some time

7      until the examiner is satisfied that the application meets the

8      requirements for a patent, and in that case, the application is

9      issued by the PTO as a patent, or in the alternative, if the

10      examiner ultimately concludes that the application should

11      reject -- should be rejected, then no patent is issued.

12                   Sometimes patents are issued after appeals within the

13      PTO or to a court.       The papers generated during these

14      communications back and forth between the examiner and the

15      applicant are called the prosecution history.

16                   The fact that the PTO grants a patent doesn't

17      necessarily mean that any invention claimed in the patent, in

18      fact, deserves the protection of a patent.              While an issued

19      patent is presumed to be valid under the law, a person accused

20      of infringement has the right to argue here in federal court

21      that the claimed invention in the patent is invalid.

22                   It's your job as the jury to consider the evidence

23      presented by the parties and to determine independently and for

24      yourselves whether or not the accused infringer has proven that

25      a patent is invalid.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 10 of 129 PageID #: 61295 10



1                    To help you follow the evidence, I'll now give you a

2       brief summary of the positions of the parties.

3                    The party who brings a lawsuit is called the

4       Plaintiff.     The Plaintiff in this case is Metaswitch Networks

5       Limited, who will be referred to throughout the trial either as

6       simply the Plaintiff, or for short, as Metaswitch.

7                    The party against whom a suit is brought is called

8       the Defendant.      In this case, the Defendants are Genband US LLC

9       and Genband Management Services Corp., who will be referred to

10      throughout the trial collectively simply as Genband or as the

11      Defendants.

12                   After Metaswitch brought this suit against Genband,

13      Genband brought its own claims against Metaswitch.                These are

14      called counterclaims.        The party who brings the counterclaim is

15      called the counter-Plaintiff.          Therefore, in regard to these

16      counterclaims, the counter-Plaintiff is Genband US LLC.

17                   The party against whom the counterclaims are brought

18      is called the counter-Defendant.           And in regard to Genband's

19      counterclaims, the Defendants, Metaswitch Networks Corp., and

20      Metaswitch, Inc., and Metaswitch Networks Limited are the

21      counter-Defendants.

22                   Again, you will probably throughout the trial mostly

23      hear Genband and Metaswitch, Metaswitch and Genband.                But those

24      are the technical positions between the parties.

25                   As I told you during jury selection on Tuesday, this
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 11 of 129 PageID #: 61296 11



1       is a case of alleged patent infringement.             To summarize,

2       Metaswitch accuses Genband of infringing Metaswitch's patents.

3       Likewise, Genband is accusing Metaswitch of infringing

4       Genband's patents.

5                   Metaswitch is asserting six patents in this case.

6       The first Metaswitch patent at issue in this case is United

7       States Patent No. 6,807,273.          Now, patents are commonly known

8       by their last three digits, so I'll refer to this patent and

9       you'll hear this patent referred to throughout the trial as the

10      '273 patent.

11                  The second Metaswitch patent is United States Patent

12      No. 7,881,282, which you'll hear referred to as the '282

13      patent.

14                  The third Metaswitch patent at issue in this case is

15      United States Patent No. 6,816,482, which you'll hear referred

16      to simply as the '482 or the '482 patent.

17                  And the fourth Metaswitch patent at issue is United

18      States Patent No. 8,611,522, referred to simply as the '522

19      patent.

20                  The fifth Metaswitch patent at issue in this case is

21      United States Patent No. 8,687,640, which you'll hear referred

22      to as the '640 or the '640 patent.

23                  The sixth and final Metaswitch patent at issue in

24      this case is United States Patent No. 8,488,768, referred to

25      simply as the '768 patent.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 12 of 129 PageID #: 61297 12



1                   These are called the Metaswitch patents-in-suit or

2       the Metaswitch asserted patents.           And these patents generally

3       relate to telecommunications, such as communications over an

4       Internet protocol network, in particular, Voice over Internet

5       Protocol, or as you will hear that term called throughout the

6       trial, VoiP.

7                   You'll have a complete copy of each of these six

8       Metaswitch patents in your juror notebooks which will be given

9       to you in a few moments.

10                  Metaswitch contends that Genband is directly

11      infringing certain claims of Metaswitch's patents-in-suit by

12      importing, making, and selling products that handle and perform

13      the patented technology.

14                  Genband denies that it is infringing the Metaswitch

15      patents and contends that the Metaswitch patents in this case

16      are invalid as being anticipated by the prior art or as obvious

17      in light of such prior art or lacking a written description or

18      as lacking an embodiment.

19                  I'll give you more detailed instructions regarding

20      the meaning of these terms in a few moments.

21                  Genband also contends that Metaswitch is not entitled

22      at all to the damages that Metaswitch is requesting.

23                  Also, in this case, ladies and gentlemen, Genband is

24      asserting four of its patents.

25                  The first Genband patent at issue in this case is
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 13 of 129 PageID #: 61298 13



1       United States Patent 8,600,006, which will be referred to as

2       the '006 patent.

3                   The second Genband patent at issue is United States

4       Patent 7,953,210, referred to for short as the '210 patent.

5                   The third Genband patent is United States Patent

6       7,680,252, referred to -- referred to for short as the '252

7       patent.

8                   And the fourth and last Genband patent at issue in

9       this case is United States Patent No. 6,879,667, referred to

10      simply as the '667 patent.

11                  These are called the Genband patents-in-suit or the

12      Genband asserted patents, and these patents generally relate to

13      telecommunications, such as communications over an Internet

14      protocol network, in particular, Voice over Internet Protocol

15      or VoiP.

16                  You'll also have a complete copy of each of these

17      four Genband patents in your juror notebooks, which, as I say,

18      will be given to you in a few moments.

19                  Genband contends that Metaswitch is directly

20      infringing certain claims of the patents-in-suit by importing,

21      making, or selling products that include or perform the

22      patented technology.

23                  Metaswitch denies that it is infringing any of the

24      four Genband patents and contends that the Genband

25      patents-in-suit are invalid as being anticipated by the prior
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 14 of 129 PageID #: 61299 14



1       art, obvious in light of the prior art, lacking a written

2       description, or lacking enablement.

3                   And as I say, I will give you more detailed

4       instructions regarding the meanings of those terms in just a

5       few minutes.

6                   Metaswitch also contends that Genband is not entitled

7       to any damages.

8                   Now, ladies and gentlemen, I know that these are new

9       words and new concepts that I've just thrown at you, and I'm

10      going to define a lot of these words and concepts for you as we

11      go through these instructions.

12                  The attorneys are going to discuss them in their

13      opening statements.       The witnesses are going to help you go

14      through them in their testimony to help you understand these

15      terms.    So do not feel overwhelmed at this stage.             I promise

16      you, it's all going to come together as we go through the

17      trial.

18                  Your job in this case is to decide whether the

19      asserted claims have been infringed and whether the asserted

20      claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid.

21                  If you decide that any claim of the patents-in-suit

22      have been infringed and is not invalid, then you'll need to

23      decide what amount of money damages are to be awarded to the

24      patentholder as compensation for such infringement.

25                  Now, my job, as I said, is to tell you what the law
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 15 of 129 PageID #: 61300 15



1       is, to handle rulings on evidence and procedure and answer

2       questions of law and to oversee the conduct of the trial.

3                   In determining the law, it is specifically my job to

4       determine the meaning of any of the claim language from which

5       the asserted -- or within the asserted patents that needs

6       interpretation.

7                   And I've already determined the meaning of the claims

8       of the patents-in-suit, and you must accept the meanings that I

9       give you and use those meanings when you decide whether any

10      particular claim has or has not been infringed and whether or

11      not any claim is invalid.

12                  As I say, you'll be given a document in a few minutes

13      as a part of your juror notebooks that reflects these meanings

14      that the Court has provided.

15                  For any claim term for which I've not provided you

16      with a definition or a construction, you should apply the plain

17      and ordinary meaning.        If I've provided you with a definition,

18      sometimes called a construction, then you are -- you are to

19      apply my definition to those terms throughout the case.

20                  However, ladies and gentlemen, my interpretation of

21      the language of the claims shouldn't be taken by you as an

22      indication that I have a personal opinion nor any opinion at

23      all regarding the issues of infringement and invalidity because

24      those issues are yours alone to decide.

25                  I'll provide you with more detailed instructions on
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 16 of 129 PageID #: 61301 16



1       the meaning of the claims before you retire to deliberate and

2       reach your verdict.

3                   In deciding the issues that are before you, you'll be

4       asked to consider specific legal rules, and I'll give you an

5       overview of those rules now.          And then at the conclusion of the

6       case, I'll give you more detailed instructions.

7                   The first issue that you'll be asked to decide is

8       whether Genband has infringed any of the asserted claims of the

9       Metaswitch patents and whether Metaswitch has infringed any of

10      the asserted claims of the Genband patents.

11                  Infringement is assessed on a claim-by-claim basis,

12      and the party alleging infringement must show by a

13      preponderance of the evidence that a claim has been infringed.

14      Therefore, there may be infringement as to one claim but no

15      infringement as to another claim.

16                  There are also a few different ways that a patent can

17      be infringed.      I'll explain the requirements for each of these

18      types of infringement to you in detail at the conclusion of the

19      case.

20                  But in general, Metaswitch or Genband may infringe

21      the other's asserted patents by making, using, selling, or

22      offering for sale in the United States or importing into the

23      United States a product or by performing a method meeting all

24      the requirements of a claim of the asserted patents.

25                  I'll provide you with more detailed instructions on
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 17 of 129 PageID #: 61302 17



1       the requirements of infringement at the conclusion of the case.

2                   The second issue that you'll be asked to decide is

3       whether each party's asserted -- asserted patents are invalid.

4       Invalidity is a defense to infringement.

5                   Therefore, even though the United States Patent and

6       Trademark Office has allowed the asserted claims and even

7       though a patent is presumed to be valid, you, the jury, must

8       decide whether those claims are invalid after hearing all the

9       evidence presented during this case.

10                  You may find a patent claim to be invalid for a

11      number of reasons, including because it claims subject matter

12      that is not new or is obvious.

13                  For a patent claim to be invalid because it is not

14      new, the accused infringer must show by clear and convincing

15      evidence that all of the elements of a claim are sufficiently

16      described in a single previously printed publication or patent.

17      We call these items prior art.

18                  If a claim is not new, it is said to be anticipated.

19      Another way that a claim can be found to be invalid is that it

20      may have been obvious.

21                  Even though a claim is not anticipated because every

22      element of a claim is not shown or sufficiently described in a

23      single piece of prior art, the claim may still be invalid if it

24      would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the

25      field of technology of the patent at the relevant time.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 18 of 129 PageID #: 61303 18



1                   You'll need to consider a number of questions in

2       deciding whether the inventions claimed in the asserted patents

3       are obvious.      And I'll provide you with more detailed

4       instructions on these questions at the conclusion of the trial.

5                   A patent may also be invalid, ladies and gentlemen,

6       if its description in the specification does not meet certain

7       requirements.      To be valid, a patent must meet the written

8       description requirement.

9                   In order to meet this written description

10      requirement, the description of the invention in the

11      specification portion of the patent must be detailed enough to

12      demonstrate that the applicant actually possessed the invention

13      as broadly as claimed in the claims of the issued patent.

14                  If you decide that any claim of the patents-in-suit

15      has been infringed and is not invalid -- that is, the

16      presumption of validity under the law has survived -- then

17      you'll need to decide what amount of money damages are to be

18      awarded to the patent owner to compensate it for that

19      infringement.

20                  A damage award in a patent case must be adequate to

21      compensate the patentholder for the infringement and in no

22      event may the damage award be less than what the patentholder

23      would have received had it been paid a reasonable royalty for

24      the use of its patent.

25                  However, the damages you award, if any, are meant to
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 19 of 129 PageID #: 61304 19



1       compensate the patentholder and not to punish an accused

2       infringer.

3                    You may not include in your award any additional

4       amount as a fine or as a penalty above what is necessary to

5       fully compensate the patent owner for the infringement.

6                    Moreover, damages cannot be speculative, and the

7       patent owner must prove the amount of its damages for the

8       accused infringer's alleged infringement by a preponderance of

9       the evidence.

10                   I'll give you more detailed instructions on the

11      calculation of damages for the accused infringer's alleged

12      infringement of the patents-in-suit at the conclusion of the

13      trial, including by giving you more specific instructions with

14      regard to the calculation of a reasonable royalty.

15                   However, the fact that I'm instructing you about

16      damages to begin with does not mean that the patent owner is or

17      is not entitled to recover damages.

18                   Now, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to be hearing

19      from a number of witnesses in this case, and I want you to keep

20      an open mind while you're listening to the evidence and not

21      decide any of the facts until you have heard all of the

22      evidence.

23                   This is important.       While the witnesses are

24      testifying, remember you will have to decide the degree of

25      credibility and believability to allocate to the witnesses and
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 20 of 129 PageID #: 61305 20



1       to the evidence.

2                    So while the witnesses are testifying, you should be

3       asking yourselves questions like this:            Does the witness

4       impress you as being truthful?          Does he or she have a reason

5       not to tell the truth?

6                    Does he or she have any personal interest in the

7       outcome of the case?

8                    Does the witness seem to have a good memory?              Did he

9       or she have the opportunity and ability to observe accurately

10      the things they've testified about?

11                   Did the witness appear to understand the questions

12      clearly and answer them directly?

13                   And of course, does the witness's testimony differ

14      from the testimony of any other witness?             And if it does, how

15      does it differ?

16                   These are some of the kinds of the things that you

17      should be thinking about while you're listening to each of the

18      witnesses.

19                   Also, ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk to you

20      briefly about expert witnesses.

21                   When knowledge of a technical subject may be helpful

22      to you as the jury, a person who has special training and

23      experience in that particular field -- we refer to them as an

24      expert witness -- is permitted to testify to you about his or

25      her opinions on technical matters.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 21 of 129 PageID #: 61306 21



1                   However, you're not required to accept an expert

2       witness's or any other witness's opinions at all.               It's up to

3       you to decide whether you believe an expert witness or any

4       witness for that matter, whether you believe they're correct or

5       incorrect and whether or not you want to believe what they have

6       to say.

7                   Now, I anticipate there will be expert witnesses

8       testifying in support of each side in this case, but it will be

9       up to you to listen to their qualifications when they testify.

10      And when they give an opinion and explain the basis for it,

11      you'll have to evaluate what they say, whether you believe it,

12      and what degree, if any, that you want to give it weight.

13                  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, judging and

14      evaluating the credibility and believability of each and every

15      witness is an important part of your job as jurors.

16                  During the trial, it's possible that there will also

17      be testimony presented to you from one or more witnesses

18      presented through what we call a deposition.              In trials, it's

19      tough, if not impossible, to get every witness in person in

20      court at the time.       So lawyers for each side, before the trial,

21      take the depositions of the witnesses.

22                  In a deposition, the witness is present, the court

23      reporter is present, the witness is sworn and placed under oath

24      just as if he or she were personally in open court, and then

25      the parties ask them questions through their counsel, and those

1       questions and the responses are recorded.

2                   Portions of the video recordings of these questions

3       and answers may be played to you as a part of this trial so

4       that you can see that witness and hear their testimony.

5                   That deposition testimony is entitled to the same

6       consideration, and insofar as possible, is to be judged as to

7       the credibility, weight, and otherwise considered by the jury

8       in the same way as if the witness had been present and had

9       given their testimony in open court from the witness stand.

10                  Now, during the course of the trial, ladies and

11      gentlemen, it's going -- it's possible that the lawyers will

12      make objections from time to time, and I'll make rulings on

13      those objections.       It's the duty of an attorney for each side

14      of a case to object when the other side's testimony or other

15      evidence is such that the attorney believes it's not proper

16      under the rules of the court or the rules of civil procedure.

17                  Upon allowing the testimony or other evidence to be

18      introduced over the objection of an attorney, the Court does

19      not, unless I expressly say so, indicate any opinion as to the

20      weight or effect of that evidence.

21                  As I've said before, you, the jury, are the sole

22      judges of the credibility and believability of all the

23      witnesses and the weight and what effect to give to all the

24      evidence.

25                  I'd like to compliment the lawyers in this case,
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 23 of 129 PageID #: 61308 23



1       ladies and gentlemen, because up until today, there has been a

2       lot of hard work taking part through what we call the pretrial

3       process that you've not had to sit through or be a part of.

4       And through that process, the Court has already made rulings on

5       the admissibility of all the exhibits that you're going to see

6       during this trial.

7                   And that has saved you a lot of time and has saved

8       you a lot of watching and listening to questions about

9       admissibility and when was this instrument made and was it kept

10      in the normal course of business and things like that that you

11      really don't need to be put through.

12                  So the parties have spent a lot of time and effort

13      with the Court in working through all of those in advance.

14      That means, when you're shown an exhibit during this trial, it

15      means the Court's already ruled on its admissibility, and the

16      lawyers will be able to ask you questions about it and put it

17      in context without spending the time to go through all those

18      preliminaries.

19                  This will streamline the process and should make the

20      trial less confusing and more understandable, and the parties

21      and their lawyers are to be complimented for the time and

22      effort they put in to help do that before we started this

23      trial.

24                  However, even though that's all been done, it's still

25      possible that objections may arise during the trial.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 24 of 129 PageID #: 61309 24



1                   You need to know that if an objection is made and I

2       sustain the objection to a question that's asked to a witness,

3       then you must disregard the question entirely, and you may draw

4       no inference from the wording of it, and you may not speculate

5       about what the witness would have said if I had permitted the

6       witness to answer that question.

7                   However, if I overrule an objection to a question,

8       then you should consider the -- the question and the answer

9       just as if no objection had been made.

10                  You should know that the law of the United States

11      permits a district judge in a United States District Court like

12      this to comment to the jury regarding the evidence in the case,

13      but those comments are only an expression of the judge's

14      opinion, and the jury may disregard those comments because,

15      once again, it is the jury that is the sole judges of the

16      facts, the credibility of the witnesses, and how much weight to

17      give to their testimony.

18                  I want you to know, ladies and gentlemen, that even

19      though the law might permit me to comment on the evidence in

20      this case, as I indicated to you during jury selection, I'm

21      going to try very hard not to do that.            I'm going to try very

22      hard not to comment on any of the evidence or the witnesses

23      throughout the trial.

24                  Now, in front of me, our court reporter, Ms. Holmes,

25      is taking down everything that's said in the courtroom, and she
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 25 of 129 PageID #: 61310 25



1       will do that throughout the trial.

2                   However, the written transcript of what's been said

3       will not be available in time for your deliberations on the

4       verdict.    The transcript's prepared in case there's an appeal

5       after this trial to another court.           That means that you're

6       going to have to rely on your memories of the evidence in this

7       case.

8                   In a moment, you're each going to be given a juror

9       notebook.     In the back of that notebook, you'll find a legal

10      pad with blank pages upon which you can take notes, if you

11      wish.    It's up to each of you to decide whether or not you want

12      to take notes, and if you do, how detailed you want your notes

13      to be.

14                  But remember, those notes, if you take them, are for

15      your personal use.       You have to rely on your own memory of the

16      evidence, and that's why you should play close attention to the

17      testimony of each and every witness throughout the trial.

18                  You should not abandon your own recollection because

19      somebody else's notes indicate something different.                Your notes

20      are simply to refresh your recollection, and that's the only

21      reason that you should keep them, if you decide to take notes.

22                  I'm now going to ask Mr. Johnston, our Court Security

23      Officer, to hand out these juror notebooks to the members of

24      the jury.

25                  Once you get them, you may open them and start to
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 26 of 129 PageID #: 61311 26



1       flip through them, if you want to.           You will see that there are

2       pages listing the claim terms that I've talked about.                Those

3       are the words that are found in the numbered claims at the back

4       of the patents-in-suit.        You'll also see that you have a copy

5       of each of the asserted patents in this case, and we've talked

6       about those.

7                   Along with the claim terms that the Court has

8       interpreted, you'll find that you have a definition that the

9       Court has given you in regard to those terms.

10                  You'll also find in those notebooks, ladies and

11      gentlemen, a section for witnesses, and you should have a page

12      for each witness that might testify in this case with a

13      photograph of that witness at the top of the page and their

14      name identifying the witness below that photograph.

15                  Whenever you leave for the day, I want you to take

16      those notebooks and leave them on the table in the jury room.

17      They should either be with you in the jury box where you are

18      now or they should be on the table in the jury room.

19                  Now, the only exception to that is, during the trial,

20      we might take a short recess for a few minutes from time to

21      time, and if so, I can tell you or I might tell you either you

22      may leave your notebooks in your chairs.

23                  When you're only going to be gone a few minutes,

24      rather than carrying them back and forth to the jury room, I

25      may tell you just to leave them in your chairs.               But for
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 27 of 129 PageID #: 61312 27



1       anything longer than a short recess, they should either be in

2       your possession like they are now or they should be on the

3       table in the jury room.

4                   And in all cases, at the end of each day, please make

5       sure you carry it with you when you leave the jury box for that

6       day and leave it on the table in the jury room before you exit

7       the courthouse and go home that evening.

8                   All right.      We're going to have opening statements

9       from the lawyers in a few minutes, but before we do, I want to

10      give you a brief roadmap of how the trial is going to be

11      structured before we have those opening statements.

12                  After the opening statements from each side, the

13      Plaintiff, Metaswitch, will present its evidence in support of

14      its contentions that the claims of its patents have been and

15      continue to be infringed by Genband.

16                  To prove infringement of any claim, Metaswitch must

17      persuade you that it is more likely than not, more likely true

18      than not true that Genband has infringed -- infringed that

19      claim by a preponderance of the evidence.

20                  After Metaswitch has presented their evidence, they

21      will rest their case, and at that time, Genband will present

22      its evidence that the asserted claims of the Metaswitch patents

23      are invalid.

24                  Genband will also present evidence trying to persuade

25      you that Metaswitch has infringed its patents, and Genband will
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 28 of 129 PageID #: 61313 28



1       put on evidence responding to the evidence that Metaswitch has

2       offered.

3                   Then after Genband, the Defendant, has rested its

4       case, then Metaswitch, the Plaintiff, will be permitted to put

5       on its rebuttal case in which it may present evidence

6       responding to the evidence by Genband.

7                   And since Genband has its own affirmative claims

8       against Metaswitch, it too will be permitted to put on a

9       rebuttal case responding to the evidence that Metaswitch has

10      offered during the trial.

11                  After both sides have put on their case-in-chief and

12      both sides have put on their rebuttal case, then the attorneys

13      for both sides will present their closing arguments to you

14      after I have given you my final instructions.

15                  The final instructions that the Court gives you are

16      often called the Court's charge to the jury.              As I say, after

17      I've done that, the lawyers will present their closing

18      arguments, and after that, I will instruct you to retire to the

19      jury room and to deliberate on your verdict.

20                  I want to repeat my earlier instruction to you that

21      you're not to discuss the case among yourselves at any time

22      throughout the trial until all the evidence is in, until final

23      closing arguments have been given, until my final instructions

24      have been given you, and until I say:            Ladies and gentlemen,

25      you may now retire to deliberate upon your verdict.                Then you
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 29 of 129 PageID #: 61314 29



1       may discuss the case among yourselves.

2                   As a matter of fact, at that point, you must discuss

3       the case among yourselves.         But until then, you should not

4       under any circumstances discuss the case among yourselves, and

5       throughout the entire trial, until I release you from your duty

6       as jurors, you must not discuss the case with anyone else,

7       period.    I made a lengthy explanation during jury selection as

8       to why that's important.

9                   I want to remind you that the basis upon which you

10      will answer the questions in the verdict form must be limited

11      to the evidence that's presented in this courtroom during this

12      trial that comes before you either as the sworn testimony of

13      witnesses that's subject to cross-examination or as to the

14      exhibits that the Court expressly admits into evidence.

15                  That should be the sole source of the knowledge and

16      information that forms the basis for you to answer the

17      questions in the verdict form.

18                  That's why it is critical that you not discuss the

19      case with anyone, communicate about it in any way, do any

20      research of any type, and that's why you should not, under any

21      circumstances, discuss or communicate among yourselves about

22      the case until all the evidence is in and you retire to

23      deliberate.

24                  I think you understand that's very important.               And I

25      want you to understand -- like I told you during jury
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 30 of 129 PageID #: 61315 30



1       selection, because it's so important, you're going to hear me

2       instruct you on that throughout the trial.

3                   You're probably going to be sick and tired of hearing

4       that from me before this case is over, but I'm going to

5       continue to give you that instruction because it is so

6       critically important to the entire process.

7                   Also, I want to remind you again, as I did during

8       jury selection, throughout the course of the trial, it's

9       likely -- in fact, it's probably impossible that you won't at

10      some time walk by one of the lawyers in the case, one of the

11      witnesses in the case, one of the representatives of one of the

12      parties in the case.

13                  And when that happens, they are not going to enter

14      into any discussion or conversation with you.              They're not even

15      going to say good morning.         They may not even smile at you.

16      And that's because I've instructed them not to have any

17      interaction with the jury at all.

18                  So when that happens, don't blame them.             Don't think

19      they're being rude.       Don't think they're being unfriendly.

20      They're simply doing what the Court requires of them.

21                  All right.      With these instructions, we're now going

22      to hear opening statements from the parties.              We'll begin with

23      the opening statement from the Plaintiff, Metaswitch.

24                  Mr. Verhoeven, you may address the jury.

25                  MR. VERHOEVEN:       Thank you, Your Honor.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 31 of 129 PageID #: 61316 31



1                   THE COURT:      Would you like a warning on your time?

2                   MR. VERHOEVEN:       Yes, Your Honor.      Five minutes,

3       please.

4                   THE COURT:      All right.     You may proceed when you're

5       ready.

6                   MR. VERHOEVEN:       Good morning, members of the jury.

7       My name is Charles Verhoeven, and I represent Metaswitch.

8                   This case is -- concerns Voice over Internet Protocol

9       technology, as the Judge told you.           My client, Metaswitch, is a

10      research and development innovator in this area, in Voice over

11      Internet technology.

12                  We are bringing a lawsuit against Genband.              Genband

13      is a competitor of ours in the Voice over Internet technology

14      space -- they're a larger company -- for infringement of six

15      Metaswitch patents.

16                  So here are our copies of the patents at issue.               They

17      were issued by the United States Patent Office, and Metaswitch

18      is the owner of these patents.

19                  And the basic issue that you're going to be

20      evaluating, as you see the evidence today, is whether or not

21      there's infringement on these six patents.

22                  And if you do find there's infringement, what is the

23      amount -- the appropriate amount of damages to compensate

24      Metaswitch for that infringement.           And I'm going to go into --

25      in my opening statement, some details of that, but big picture,
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 32 of 129 PageID #: 61317 32



1       that's why we're here today.

2                   I'd also like to, before I get into my presentation,

3       say thank you again.        This is a very burdensome process for

4       you, I know, and rest assured, we are fully aware of that, and

5       we're trying to make it as convenient as possible.

6                   But we very much appreciate your service sitting on

7       this jury and performing your duties as triers of the facts.

8       Even though it seems like Mother Nature was trying to stop us

9       from getting here today, we all made it.             So great.

10                  So let me start by talking about who is the

11      Plaintiff, Metaswitch.        Metaswitch started out as Data

12      Connection way back in 1981, and here's an image of -- of a

13      picture they all took during Christmas.

14                  Metaswitch started -- was formed in Enfield, the

15      United Kingdom, back in 1981.          Today, it has regional offices

16      throughout the U.S. and the UK.           So, for example, in Texas,

17      Metaswitch has its office in Richardson, which is the

18      telecommunications corridor.

19                  We have here today the CEO of Metaswitch, Mr. Martin

20      Lund, who's come down here to -- to watch these proceedings.

21      We also have a series of gentlemen from the Richardson office

22      here today as well.       Those gentlemen work in Richardson at

23      Metaswitch's facilities there.

24                  We also have -- I'd like to introduce Mr. Al

25      Mitchell.     Mr. Mitchell is the senior vice president of
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 33 of 129 PageID #: 61318 33



1       engineering at Metaswitch.         He is what we'll refer to as our

2       corporate representative who will be here every day at trial.

3       He'll also be called as a witness and will provide testimony to

4       you with respect to this case.

5                   Now, there are six patents at issue here.              I'll refer

6       to those as the Metaswitch patents.            And all of these patents

7       relate to this general category of technology, Voice over

8       Internet Protocol.

9                   As I said before, at a big picture level, you'll be

10      asked as the triers of fact to decide two major issues.                 There

11      will be other issues as well, but these are the major issues

12      that I'd like to focus your attention on.

13                  First, you'll be asked to look at the patents,

14      compare the claims of the patents to the accused products, and

15      make a factual decision as to whether or not Genband infringes

16      Metaswitch's patents.

17                  And so we'll have expert witnesses come and talk

18      about this infringement, and the evidence is going to prove

19      that they do infringe these patents.            And we'll -- we'll have

20      expert witnesses that come and provide you with testimony on

21      that.

22                  The second big question that you'll be asked is, if

23      you find that there's infringement, what amount of damages

24      should Genband pay for infringing those products?

25                  Now, let me talk a little bit about the first of the
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 34 of 129 PageID #: 61319 34



1       two issues, infringement.

2                    Patent rights, as the Court has told you, are a basic

3       right in the United States that's guaranteed by the United

4       States Constitution, all the way from our founders.

5                    They recognized that inventors who should be able to

6       get a patent on their inventions, then that would give them the

7       exclusive right to use what they've invented.              They could sell

8       it to other people.       They could decide not to do anything with

9       it.   They could use it themselves.          It's their property.

10                   When you get a patent, like this one here, on the

11      cover page of the patent from the United States Patent Office,

12      it expressly says:       It grants the person having title to this

13      patent the right to exclude others from using the patented

14      invention.

15                   So one way of thinking about what patents are is

16      to -- it's not exactly the same but is to look -- think about a

17      piece of property.       So patents are what's called intellectual

18      property.     You can't really see it like you can a plot of land,

19      but they're similar to real property.

20                   And a patent is similar to a deed that you might have

21      on a piece of property.        And if you have that right, then you

22      have the right to exclude others from trespassing on your

23      patented invention.

24                   And this first question is asking -- is asking:              Are

25      they trespassing on Metaswitch's property?             That's basically
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 35 of 129 PageID #: 61320 35



1       what you're going to be looking at.

2                   Now, this is a summary of what the evidence will

3       show.    I don't have time to go over all six of the patents, so

4       I'd like to give you -- pick a couple of patents that

5       Metaswitch has and show you what the evidence is going to

6       indicate with respect to those patents.

7                   So, first, I'd like to talk about the '273 patent.

8       The '273 patent inventor is a gentleman by the name of David

9       Smith.    And the evidence is going to show that he came up with

10      his invention on his own with his own company, a company called

11      New CAP5 (sic).      It's really just him, and it's a very, very

12      small company, one or two or three people.

13                  But he came up with his invention, and then later,

14      Metaswitch acquired assets from his company, New CAP5 (sic),

15      including this patent, this '273 patent.

16                  And Mr. Smith's patent concerned the migration of

17      technology from the old traditional Public Switched Telephone

18      Network to a new digital Voice Over Internet Protocol

19      technology.

20                  Here you see on this Slide 12 here, this is what's

21      called a Class 5 switch.         This is a term that you're going to

22      hear throughout this case.         And this is what I'll call legacy

23      technology, old technology.

24                  So this, for example, was around in the 1980s.               This

25      was cutting-edge technology maybe in the 1980s.               We're now at
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 36 of 129 PageID #: 61321 36



1       2016.    So this is old technology.         The electronics in it you

2       see it took a whole room, filled up a whole room.

3                   Now, as you probably know, you've got a little box

4       this big (indicating) that can do all that stuff.               But there's

5       a problem with upgrading on a Class 5 switch, and that is --

6       and this is recognized in Mr. Smith's patent; that is, these

7       old Class 5 switches are physically interfaced with what are

8       called line trunk frames.

9                   And in this illustration here, if you look on the

10      left, you see the building.         That's -- that building, in the

11      old days, the -- the Class 5 switch would take up a whole

12      floor, and out -- and coming out of that building will be

13      literally hundreds of thousands of pairs of trunk line wires.

14                  And these are the physical wires that go to your

15      house.    So you're -- the phone company has a wire for every

16      single house, okay?       And the problem with replacing these old

17      Class 5 switches is you'd have to replace all these copper

18      wires and everything going to the houses, which would be

19      incredibly expensive.

20                  And so it would not -- customers who are buying these

21      products were reluctant to spend all of that money to have to

22      tear out all these trunk line pairs of wires.

23                  So Mr. Smith came up with his idea, is to basically

24      chop the brain of the Class 5 switch off, disconnect it, and

25      then bypass that brain with a digital softswitch that connected
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 37 of 129 PageID #: 61322 37



1       directly -- interfaced with these trunk line cables, and that

2       way you could put a new brain in your switch and modernize it,

3       but you didn't have to rip out all of these trunk line cables,

4       which is very, very expensive.          So it's very valuable

5       innovation that he came up with.

6                   So to illustrate here on Slide 13, if you go into a

7       Class 5 switch, you'll -- you'll see these trunk line frames

8       are connected to a common control and a switch matrix.                 Those

9       are the green boxes.        And that's basically the brain of the

10      Class 5 switch.

11                  What Mr. Smith patented was an invention that

12      bypassed that brain.        So, for example, if you look at the

13      objects in the summary of the invention, it says it is a

14      primary object of this invention to -- to provide a method of

15      bypassing the common control and switch matrix of a Class 5

16      digital switch so that their limitations may be overcome while

17      retaining the large investment in trunk line frames and cable

18      plant.

19                  And so if you look at the bottom of this slide, you

20      see the trunk line frames there on the bottom.               That's the

21      thousands and thousands of lines.           Those are connected in the

22      legacy switch to the common control and switch matrix, which I

23      said is the brain.

24                  And what the '273 patent does is it disconnects the

25      interface to the brain of the old Class 5 switch, and it
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 38 of 129 PageID #: 61323 38



1       bypasses it using something called a switching system

2       interface.

3                    So you still have all those old trunk line frames

4       that are too expensive to tear out and replace, but you bypass

5       the old brain of the 1980s Class 5 switch, and you put in a new

6       switching interface that then connects to a media gateway,

7       which is a modern software called a softswitch, gateway.                 This

8       has all the digital technology that's modern.

9                    So this is a great way to update your legacy Class 5

10      switch in a way that doesn't require you to tear out all the

11      trunk line frames.

12                   After this patent issued, the evidence is going to

13      show that Genband released multiple products that infringe this

14      patent.    I'm not going to name them all.           These are -- these

15      are displayed here on this slide, and the -- and we'll go

16      through each of those with the evidence.

17                   I'm going to give you an example, though, of what the

18      evidence will show.

19                   So one of the products is called a C15.            The evidence

20      will show that Genband markets the C15 to do exactly what

21      Mr. Smith's patent, '273 patent, claims.

22                   This is a picture of Dave Jarzemsky.            He provided

23      testimony in this case.        He is a Genband product manager for

24      the C15.     He was designated by Genband to provide testimony as

25      the corporate representative for how the C15 works.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 39 of 129 PageID #: 61324 39



1                   And on the right here, the evidence is going to show

2       that he drew this picture on the right-hand side to demonstrate

3       how the C15 is used to replace the brains of a Class 5 switch.

4       And here I've added some highlighting on it.

5                   And when you look at this, you can see that in his

6       diagram, he drew Xs on the connections to the brain, the switch

7       matrix and the common control, and the C15 then has the

8       interface, the green line there, that bypasses the old brains,

9       the switch matrix and the common control, and connects directly

10      to the line trunk frames, which the evidence will show Genband

11      refers to as LCM.

12                  So what you have here is very, very clear

13      infringement by Genband of the '273 patent.

14                  Now, we're going to call a renowned expert in this

15      field in telecommunications.          His name is Dr. Eric Burger.             And

16      he's going to come and -- and -- and testify with respect to

17      infringement on this patent.          And he's going to go through all

18      this evidence.

19                  Here's another piece of evidence he's going to talk

20      about from their own web page where they're touting the -- to

21      the public what the C15 can do.           And it says:     Service

22      providers with legacy networks face substantial challenges and

23      risks due to the rapidly aging -- rapid aging of these old

24      Legacy switches.       That's the big switch from the 1980s that I

25      showed you.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 40 of 129 PageID #: 61325 40



1                   Their product is a replacement for the brains of that

2       switch, and in marketing it, they expressly say that this C15

3       reduces capital expenditures and leverages existing fixed

4       access by connecting to the line frames of the old Class 5

5       switch, exactly what the '273 patent is claiming.

6                   The evidence is also going to show, members of the

7       jury, that Genband knew about this technology and this patent.

8       So, for example, the evidence will show that the inventor of

9       the '273 patent explained his technology to Charles Vogt who

10      was then the CEO of Genband, and he explained it over a

11      breakfast meeting.

12                  The evidence will show that when the patent issued in

13      2006, Mr. Smith sent a notice letter to Genband notifying --

14      you can see it right here.         He signed it, and he sent it to the

15      general counsel of Genband, and he said:             We want to inform you

16      of Patent No. 6,807,273.

17                  And then he goes on to say that he thinks it's of

18      significant value.       So there's no question that Genband was

19      aware of this patent.

20                  In fact, the evidence will show that the chief

21      technology officer of Genband, Don Sparks, signed for this

22      letter.    It was sent by certified mail, and Don Sparks signed

23      it to indicate and show that they had received it.                This is the

24      chief technology officer of Genband, read this letter.

25                  Well, what will the evidence show about infringement
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 41 of 129 PageID #: 61326 41



1       here?     The evidence will show that after -- after this point in

2       time, Genband releases new versions of its G6 and G2 which

3       contained the infringing technology, even though they knew

4       about the patent.

5                    Now, they knew about the patent.          They're infringing

6       it.     They have a little company named New CAP5 (sic).             That's

7       Mr. Smith.     They're not too worried about it.

8                    What happens?     In 2011, Metaswitch purchased those

9       assets I told you about from New Class Five.              And one of those

10      assets was the '273 patent.         And the evidence is going to show

11      that Genband was concerned.

12                   So, for example, there's an email to Mr. John

13      McCready.     Mr. McCready is right here, a Genband officer.              And

14      the person sending the mail refers to the concern I mentioned

15      to you both on Meta's C15 replacement option for DMS line

16      frames -- and the email will refer to -- will attach a detailed

17      analysis of that technology based on prior knowledge of New

18      Class Five and a product concept that New Class Five had

19      described four or five years ago.           So their internal documents

20      acknowledge they already know about this stuff.

21                   You're also going to see an email from Danny Peeler

22      dated April 10 that also shows that -- to Bill Gentry -- I'll

23      just read it.

24                   I know that Metaswitch recently bought New Class

25      Five.     I've seen internal Genband discussions of this for well
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 42 of 129 PageID #: 61327 42



1       over a year now.       I'm aware of the threat.

2                   Nevertheless, the evidence is going to show that

3       Genband continued to release more and more products that

4       contained this same infringing technology.

5                   Now, I don't have time to go through all of the other

6       patents.    I will briefly say --

7                   If we can go to Slide 35, please, Mr. Fisher.

8                   -- that with respect to three of the patents -- we're

9       going to have Dr. Burger come testify -- that you've seen, and

10      with respect to three other of the patents, we're going to have

11      Dr. Tim Williams come and provide testimony.              And he's going to

12      talk about infringement of these three other patents.

13                  Now, the second issue that I told you is a general

14      issue to look at is what amount of damages should Genband pay

15      for using or infringing the Metaswitch patents.

16                  The law here is very clear.          There's a statute in

17      the -- 35 U.S.C. 284, and it says:           Upon a finding for the

18      claimant, the Court shall award claimant damages adequate to

19      compensate for the infringement.           And it continues:       But in no

20      event less than a reasonable royalty.

21                  So if you find infringement, you must award a

22      reasonable royalty.

23                  Now, the next part of the statute is very important.

24      It says:    For the use made of the invention by the infringer.

25      So when you -- you'll -- you'll get evidence on this, but the
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 43 of 129 PageID #: 61328 43



1       task is what is the royalty for the use by Genband of this

2       patented technology?

3                   When opposing counsel stands up to present his

4       opening statement, you may hear these patents aren't that

5       valuable because Metaswitch bought them for less than the

6       damages, or these patents aren't that valuable because

7       Metaswitch doesn't use some of the patents.

8                   Well, there's no requirement that you use -- it's

9       just like a piece of property.          If you own it, you own it.             You

10      don't have to do stuff with it.           If somebody trespasses on it,

11      they have to pay you for it.

12                  And what you need to look at is what was the benefit

13      that the infringer got, not how much did Metaswitch pay for

14      something, not did Metaswitch practice something.

15                  If you have a plot of land, and someone comes and

16      doesn't tell you, and you bought the land for a hundred

17      thousand dollars, and someone comes up and doesn't tell you and

18      trespasses on your land and takes out minerals or oil, that

19      might be worth a lot more than what you paid for -- for the

20      property, but you're still entitled to the value of that -- of

21      what the infringer took, even if it's a lot more valuable than

22      what you paid for the property.

23                  The question is:       What value did the infringer get?

24      What value did the trespasser get that took the minerals?                 And

25      then what's a reasonable royalty of that amount?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 44 of 129 PageID #: 61329 44



1                   We're going to present evidence -- we're going to

2       have a third expert, Mr. Ray Sims, who is a renowned expert in

3       the patent area for calculation of damages, and he's going to

4       go through each of the patents, and all you see here is his --

5       his final conclusion.

6                   He's going to present his analysis of the benefit

7       that Genband got from infringement for each of these patents,

8       very detailed, and it totals up to quite a bit of money.                 Just

9       like Mr. Mann said when we were doing voir dire, it's close to

10      $60 million.

11                  But the evidence is going to show, members of the

12      jury, that Genband got a much, much higher value than that from

13      infringing these patents, and that this is, in fact, a very

14      reasonable amount of damages, given the infringement in this

15      case.

16                  How much time, Your Honor?

17                  THE COURT:      You have about five-and-a-half minutes.

18                  MR. VERHOEVEN:       Thank you, Your Honor.

19                  Now, after I sit down, Genband's counsel is going to

20      get up and present their side of the case.             And I submit what

21      you're going to hear is a lot of excuses.

22                  First, they're going to say:          Oh, we don't infringe

23      any of these six patents.         None of them.

24                  Then they're going to say:          Well, if you don't

25      believe that, these patents are invalid, even though the Patent
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 45 of 129 PageID #: 61330 45



1       and Trademark Office issued them and that there's a presumption

2       of validity.

3                   Sometimes they're going to say:           Well, there's a

4       specific piece of art that shows every single thing of a patent

5       that's called anticipation.

6                   THE COURT:      You're now five minutes.

7                   MR. VERHOEVEN:       Thank you, Your Honor.

8                   But if you don't believe that, you could put together

9       some pieces of art, and it would have been obvious.                It would

10      have been obvious to do all six.           The Patent Office got it

11      wrong six times is what they're going to say.

12                  Now, if you don't believe that, let's take the -- the

13      '273 patent we just went through.           If you don't believe that,

14      they're going to say:        Well, even though we just said the

15      patents are obvious, there's no way that anyone could ever

16      build the '273 patent.        It's not enabled.       It's too hard to

17      figure out how to even make the claimed innovation.                That's

18      called enablement.

19                  So on one hand, it's obvious.           On the other hand, no

20      one could figure it out.

21                  Then they're going to say:          Well, Metaswitch doesn't

22      practice that particular patent, and, therefore, damages should

23      be zero or really, really low.

24                  Well, the evidence will show that some of these

25      patents -- the '640 patent, for example, Metaswitch does
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 46 of 129 PageID #: 61331 46



1       practice.     There's some they don't.         And -- but there are some

2       that they don't.

3                   But if you don't believe -- as I explained, whether

4       or not they practice the patent is completely irrelevant to

5       damages.    The damages question is to ask what benefit Genband

6       got, not what Metaswitch does with its property.

7                   But in any event, if you don't believe that, then

8       they're going to turn around and say inconsistently, members of

9       the jury, that Metaswitch does practice the '273 patent, it

10      does have it out there, and damages should be low because it

11      didn't mark it with the patent number.

12                  So these are -- these excuses don't match up.

13      And -- and perhaps the final excuse is they're going to try and

14      turn this case on its head, and they're going to say:                Oh, this

15      case is really about counterclaim patents, and they're going to

16      try to say those patents are earlier than Metaswitch's patents

17      that are asserted in this case and try and confuse you about

18      our claims and try to turn this case into their counterclaim

19      case instead of the case that we brought.

20                  I submit that the evidence will show that these

21      counterclaim patents, they aren't infringed.              They're being

22      asserted as a pretext to -- to take your attention away from

23      the six patents that Metaswitch has asserted in this case that

24      are infringed.

25                  For example, one of these counterclaim patents that
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 47 of 129 PageID #: 61332 47



1       they're spending a lot of money to assert, they're only asking

2       for a little over $3,000 in damages.            It costs a lot more than

3       that for them to even bring that claim.             Why are they bringing

4       it?   It's a pretext.       It's to -- it's to -- to take your

5       attention away from Metaswitch's claims.

6                   In the end, members of the jury, Genband had options.

7       It was a bigger player in the marketplace than Metaswitch.                     It

8       could have ascertained these -- these patents were out there,

9       and it could have either made sure its products weren't

10      infringing or it could have called up Metaswitch and said:                     I

11      want to pay a royalty for a license to use these patents.                 But

12      the evidence will show it did neither.            Instead, it decided to

13      infringe.

14                  So in conclusion, members of the jury, we think that

15      the evidence will show you that Metaswitch -- or excuse me --

16      that Genband's products do infringe Metaswitch's patents on the

17      first question and that Genband owes in damages at least $59

18      million for that infringement.

19                  Thank you very much.

20                  THE COURT:      All right.     The Defendants may now

21      present their opening statement.

22                  Mr. Dacus, would you like a warning on your time?

23                  MR. DACUS:      If you'd let me know when I have five

24      minutes, please, Your Honor.

25                  THE COURT:      I will.    You may proceed.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 48 of 129 PageID #: 61333 48



1                   MR. DACUS:      Thank you, Your Honor.

2                   Good morning.      Glad to see everybody's here safe and

3       dry.

4                   Let me start by reintroducing myself.             I'm Deron

5       Dacus, and along with Kurt Pankratz, Nick Schuneman, and Chad

6       Walters, we represent Genband in this lawsuit that Metaswitch

7       has brought.

8                   Let me also start by saying -- well, exactly where I

9       started with you in jury selection, and that is to say, on

10      behalf of John McCready and on behalf of the employees at

11      Genband, a very sincere thanks to you.

12                  I said thank you on Tuesday.          You now know that we

13      owe you a little more sincere thanks because you're a little

14      more invested than spending half a day here in the courthouse.

15      As I told you on Tuesday, we would not be here if this case was

16      not important to Genband.

17                  I told you on Tuesday also that since Metaswitch

18      brought the lawsuit, they were going to get to talk to you

19      first, and you remember that I asked you to commit to the fact

20      that you would listen to all the evidence before you make a

21      decision in the case.

22                  And I will tell you that having heard over the last

23      30 minutes what was said, I'm going -- I'm going to ask you to

24      recommit to that, to please wait and listen to all the evidence

25      because you're going to hear two very different versions of
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 49 of 129 PageID #: 61334 49



1       things here.

2                   And one thing you're going to be required to do and

3       one thing we're going to be required as lawyers to do is to

4       make credibility decisions.         You're going to have to make a

5       decision on which of these versions, which of these stories is

6       more credible, which is more believable.             It's just part of

7       what jurors are required to do.

8                   Now, as I told you on Tuesday, this is really a

9       case -- and I think the evidence is going to support this --

10      about the fact that Metaswitch has consistently been a step

11      behind in this Voice Over IP industry.

12                  They were late, they were behind Genband in

13      introducing products, coming to the market.              Their products

14      have been behind Genband, and Metaswitch has really come to the

15      courthouse, unfortunately like what commonly happens in our

16      society today, to try to get a step ahead.             And you're going to

17      hear in this case really a mountain of information.

18                  As you now know, there's 10 patents between the --

19      between the two parties.         It's going to feel a little like

20      drinking water through a firehose at first, I'll be honest with

21      you.   It's going to require your attention to detail.               And I

22      would ask you to please give attention to detail.

23                  But there's -- there's one other thing I want to ask

24      of you.    When you came through those doors this morning and

25      when you come through those doors each morning, you really
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 50 of 129 PageID #: 61335 50



1       brought with you what I think is probably the most important

2       tool that you're going to need in this case, and that is your

3       common sense.

4                   Although you're going to have to listen to detail,

5       pay attention to detail, I want you to -- I want you to use

6       your common sense.

7                   And you'll hear the Judge instruct you at the end of

8       the case -- he's going to tell you to use your common sense,

9       and if you do that throughout the course of this case, I think

10      it will make it easier to determine which of these versions

11      that you're going to hear is more credible and more believable.

12                  Now, in every lawsuit it's important, I think, for

13      jurors to understand how we wind up here, March 11th, 2016, in

14      a courthouse in Marshall, Texas.           And so what you see on the

15      screen is a picture of the Genband offices in Richardson,

16      Texas.

17                  And in order for you to understand how we get here in

18      Marshall, March of 2016, you really need to roll back in time

19      some 17 years.      And 17 years ago, in 1999, a gentleman by the

20      name of Brendon Mills, who was a fairly young fellow at that

21      time, but who had significant experience in the

22      telecommunications industry had an idea.

23                  He's the type of fellow -- and I wish I was more like

24      him -- who had a lot of ideas.          He was sort of an inventive

25      type, and he was the type who was willing to act on it, to
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 51 of 129 PageID #: 61336 51



1       start businesses.

2                   And so the idea that Brendon Mills had was he

3       understood in 1999 that a lot of people received their

4       telephone service through what I'll call the -- the old

5       network, what somebody said in jury selection, the -- the PSTN,

6       Public Switched Telephone Network.

7                   So on the right of the screen there, you see

8       telephone wires.       If you grew up like I did in the country on

9       an oil top road, you probably had those wires running down your

10      oil top road.      If you grew up in the -- in the city or in town,

11      you know, maybe these were buried.

12                  What Brendon also knew is that in 1999, there was

13      this new thing on the horizon, and that new thing in '99 was a

14      thing called the Internet.         It's not so new now, but it was

15      then.

16                  And what Brendon knew is that people were starting to

17      talk over the telephone through the Internet.              We all think

18      about the Internet -- certainly then we did -- as sending

19      emails, sending pictures, sending information.

20                  But what Mr. Mills knew, and it's since certainly

21      come to be true, is that people were going to talk over the

22      Internet.     And so Mr. Mills knew there was going to be a

23      problem.    The people who were talking on a phone on the old

24      phone lines needed to be able to talk to the people who were

25      using the Internet service.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 52 of 129 PageID #: 61337 52



1                   And so he came up with what you see here.              It's a

2       product called a gateway.         And the gateway allowed the people

3       on the old PSTN network to be able to talk to the people on the

4       new Internet network.        And for almost the -- most of the 2000s,

5       that's the product that Genband sold.

6                   Now, if you move -- if we move forward in our

7       timeline of how do we get here, in the late 2000s, Genband --

8       there was an opportunity for Genband to expand.               There was a

9       company by the name of Nortel Networks.

10                  Nortel Networks had been a -- a very large

11      telecommunications company.         They started up in Canada.          Had

12      literally been around since the 1800s.            To say they were

13      innovators in the telecommunication industry would -- would

14      certainly be an understatement.

15                  This is a picture of their building up in -- in

16      Richardson, just outside of Dallas.

17                  And so what Genband knew is that Nortel had equipment

18      that was used inside the Internet, not just equipment that

19      would connect the old phone system to the new phone system, but

20      they had equipment that was used inside the Internet.

21                  And what happened to Nortel in the late 2000s is what

22      happened to a lot of companies around 2008.              They got caught up

23      in the downturn in the economy in 2008, what some people call

24      the great recession.

25                  Nortel, of course, was this big company made up of
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 53 of 129 PageID #: 61338 53



1       many different sub -- subsidiaries and subdivisions, some of

2       which were not profitable at all, some of which were

3       profitable.

4                    As part of getting caught up in the recession, Nortel

5       went into what they call Chapter 11 reorganization, and they

6       decided to sell their various businesses.             And one of the

7       businesses that they sold is what's called CVAS, C-V-A-S.                 And

8       CVAS was the business that had the -- at Nortel, the Voice over

9       IP assets.     And that's what Genband bought in the late 2000s.

10                   So as we sit here today, Genband is really a

11      combination of the technology that it developed and then the

12      assets that it bought from Nortel.

13                   It didn't buy the entire CVAS business; it bought the

14      assets of CVAS.      It -- it -- the people at CVAS, at Nortel came

15      with it.     The products came with it.         Mr. McCready is one that

16      came from Nortel, and he'll tell you about that when he

17      testifies.

18                   Now, on the other side of the ledger of how we get

19      here, of course, is Metaswitch.           Metaswitch, as you heard, is a

20      company that's headquartered and was founded over in London.                    I

21      think they said Enfield, which is just outside of London.

22                   It's a company that has been around since the 1980s,

23      but it was originally known as Data Connection Limited.                 They

24      didn't change their name to Metaswitch until sometime in the

25      2000s.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 54 of 129 PageID #: 61339 54



1                   And it's a company that although it's been around

2       since the 1980s, they did not introduce the type of Voice over

3       IP equipment that we're talking about until the early 2000s.

4                   This is a picture of the type of products that they

5       introduced.     These are some of the accused products in the

6       case.    These are the same types of products that Genband sells.

7       And as we talked about, Metaswitch has always really been a

8       step behind in the introduction of the products and in the

9       technology in this space.

10                  Now, I've heard a couple of times Metaswitch say that

11      they're a research and development company.              I guess we'll --

12      we'll find out whether or not that's completely true, but one

13      thing I want you to know about Genband is Genband has been a

14      leader and an innovator in this Voice over IP.

15                  What you're looking at here is a wall in the Genband

16      offices with all of the patents that Genband has related to

17      Voice over IP.      Four of those patents, of course, are in suit

18      in this case.      And that's -- that's what I want to talk about,

19      specifically those four patents.

20                  Of course, that's exactly how we get here today.

21      That's a -- that's a long version of how we wind up in the

22      Marshall courthouse is that Metaswitch has taken these four

23      patents and used those patents without permission from

24      Metaswitch -- without permission from Genband to do so.

25                  So let me walk through what I think the evidence will
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 55 of 129 PageID #: 61340 55



1       show you with respect to these four patents and Metaswitch's

2       use of the patents.

3                   First is the '667 patent.          You're going to hear --

4       the evidence will be that this patent relates to enhanced DSP

5       sharing.    DSP means digital signal processor.            Some of you may

6       have heard of a processor.         You may -- you may have heard of

7       processors in computers.

8                   You may have seen commercials that talk about dual

9       processors.     Processors are often the most expensive part of a

10      piece of electronic equipment.          And that's certainly the case

11      in the type of equipment here.

12                  You see the Genband gateway that's shown.              These

13      gateways have many processors in them.            And so the '667 patent

14      that was invented by Genband is a way to use fewer processors

15      in a gateway.      It saves money.      It's a patent that was very

16      valuable.     Genband actually puts it into their gateway product.

17                  And what the evidence will show you is that in May of

18      2004, Metaswitch came out with its media gateway, and its

19      product uses the '667 patent.          And the evidence will be that

20      because of that, they've -- they used fewer processors, and

21      they have saved literally millions of dollars over the time

22      that they've used the patent.

23                  Now, I want to pause here for a second.             I think it's

24      important, as lawyers, that we explain the process to you.                     I

25      don't -- I'll tell you right now I don't have a cartoon or a

1       pictorial with a farmhouse and a fence around IT.

2                    And I don't for a couple of reasons.            One is I don't

3       think that's what the Judge's instructions are going to be to

4       you.   What the Judge has preliminary told you about and what

5       he's going to tell you about in the end is:              How do you go

6       about determining if these patents are infringed?

7                    You likely, before today, had never been asked to

8       determine if a product infringed a patent.             So it's not my job

9       to tell you the answer to that.           I would love to.      That would

10      make my job very easy, if I could.

11                   Our job as lawyers is to bring the evidence to you.

12      But I think in doing that, it's important that you understand,

13      as you hear the evidence, how you go about using that evidence

14      in making this decision of whether or not these patents are

15      infringed.

16                   So you see the law says a patent is infringed if each

17      and every element in the patent claim is -- is met.

18                   So what does that mean?        Here's an example.       The '667

19      patent -- you have a notebook.          I'm not asking you to turn to

20      it now, but at some point, you should turn to the back of the

21      '667 patent or any patent, and you'll see the claims.                Each

22      claim is a separate invention.

23                   Now, that's something that I didn't know when I

24      started doing patent law, that a patent can contain many

25      inventions.     So you look back there, and it says Claim 1.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 57 of 129 PageID #: 61342 57



1       That's a separate invention.          Claim 2.    That's a separate

2       invention.

3                    So what you're going to do here, your job, we're

4       going to bring experts to talk to you about infringement.

5       These are -- these guys are literally -- and gals -- are some

6       of the leading experts in the country.            And they're going to

7       give you in more detail than you ever wanted, but the kind of

8       detail that you need to make an informed decision.                They're

9       going to walk through these claims.

10                   And what they're going to do -- as an example, if we

11      were taking Claim 6 of the '667, they're going to take each of

12      these subparts, and they're going to show you where each one of

13      those is found in the Metaswitch products.

14                   And if we prove to you that each one of these

15      elements of the claim are found in the Metaswitch products,

16      then there's infringement.         That means they're using our

17      patents.

18                   So that's the process.        I had these slides in here.

19      I wasn't -- I didn't know if I was actually going to need to

20      show them because I had an expectation that the Plaintiff would

21      explain this to you, but that's really the process that we need

22      to go through here.

23                   That's the process -- that's your role.            Our role is

24      to give you the evidence, and your role is to determine if

25      there is, in fact, infringement.

1                    Two other patents that Genband has that Metaswitch

2       uses, the '252 and '210 patent, these are very closely related.

3       They're different inventions, but they're closely related.

4       You're going to hear that they relate to emergency standalone

5       processes.

6                    And what that means is when -- if your phone service

7       went down, this would allow you to still make certain calls on

8       your phone service.       For example, if the phone service went

9       down, you could still make a 911 call.            And it's because of the

10      inventions in the '252 and the '210 patent.

11                   The patents are valuable.         They've been included in

12      the Genband products since 2004.           In fact, there are

13      regulations and laws in the country that require these types of

14      features.     And what you'll see from the evidence is that in

15      August of 2006, Metaswitch came out with a product that uses

16      the '252 and the '210 patent.

17                   Finally, let me talk to you about the '006 patent.

18      This is a patent that is really -- can be best described as

19      sort of a Call Grab or a Call Grabber.            And let me give you an

20      example.

21                   If you have two types of phone service, one cell

22      service and one a landline, for example, at your house or your

23      office, this patent allows you to transfer that call without

24      having to interrupt the call.

25                   Let me give you an example.         If you're on your cell
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 59 of 129 PageID #: 61344 59



1       phone in your car and you get to your office and you want to

2       transfer that call from your cell phone to your office phone,

3       you can do that without interrupting the call.

4                   Let me say one thing, this patent is not the most

5       valuable patent out there.         VoIP services are not going to end

6       if this patent is not used.         This is what I would call, for

7       lack of a better word, kind of a cool feature.               And it's one of

8       the things that Metaswitch's lawyer said we're not asking a

9       whole lot of money for.

10                  So why are we here, and why are we taking up time?

11      Well, the reason we're here is we're willing to admit that all

12      of these patents should only be paid a reasonable value for

13      them.

14                  And, no, it's -- it's not a patent that's worth

15      millions of dollars, but it is an indication that Metaswitch is

16      willing to take our technology, whether it's big technology

17      like the '667 that saves them millions, or smaller technology

18      like this Call Grabber feature.

19                  And that's exactly what they did in July of 2012.

20      They knew that customers also liked this feature.               Other

21      customers knew it -- thought it was cool, and they put it in

22      their product in July of 2012.

23                  So this is just a timeline to show you what I told

24      you at the beginning, and that is, really at every step of the

25      way, Metaswitch has been a step behind.

1                   Now, let's talk a little bit about the Metaswitch

2       patents.    And let me talk -- start with this '273 patent that

3       Mr. Verhoeven spent most of his time on because there's a few

4       things he didn't tell you that I think are important.

5                   The first thing is that Metaswitch bought this

6       patent, the '273 patent, in 2011.           They bought it at a time

7       when Mr. Smith, although he filed for his patent in 2001, still

8       did not have a completed product.           And you're going to hear

9       testimony about that.

10                  Even though he filed for his patent in 2011 -- I

11      mean, 2001, by 2011, when he went to Metaswitch and they

12      purchased the product, he still did not have a completed

13      product that could use the patent.

14                  What they also didn't tell you is you remember those

15      slides that they showed you about Mr. Smith put us on notice of

16      his patent?     That's true.      He did.

17                  But what they failed to tell you is that when

18      Mr. Smith, acting on behalf of his company, New Class Five,

19      came to us and said:        Hey, I have this patent, the '273 patent,

20      here's what it does, we said:          Okay.    Well, we have something

21      that does the same thing, but it does not use your patented

22      method.

23                  And he agreed, and so he went on down the road.               He

24      left Genband.      He went on down the road, and he went to

25      Metaswitch.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 61 of 129 PageID #: 61346 61



1                   And Metaswitch, of course, didn't have this

2       technology, so they bought it.          And what you'll find is that

3       ultimately they had a very difficult time in trying to build

4       the product that Mr. Smith couldn't build.             Mr. Smith actually

5       went to work at Metaswitch.         He's still under contract at

6       Metaswitch.     And they had a very difficult time building the

7       product.

8                   And once they did and they put it out to the

9       marketplace to sell, customers simply didn't want it.                It's

10      just a piece of technology that customers didn't want.                 And as

11      a result, Metaswitch has never included this in products that

12      they have sold commercially.

13                  Now, there's a couple of other things the -- that

14      you're going to hear evidence about related to the '273 patent.

15      You remember from the -- from the video and the Court's

16      instructions that when you file for a patent, your patent idea

17      needs to be new, new and novel?           This one was not.

18                  There will be evidence that a gentleman named

19      Mr. Sylvain actually had a patent that does the same thing that

20      the '273 claims.

21                  And in addition to that, what you see on the top

22      where it says, switch collapse, Milton, North Carolina, you'll

23      hear that there were engineers at -- at Nortel who actually had

24      accomplished what Mr. Smith's patent did, but they did it

25      before Mr. Smith got a patent.          And as a result of that,
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 62 of 129 PageID #: 61347 62



1       Mr. Smith's patent should have not ever been issued.

2                   And I know you're going to say:           Well, the Patent and

3       Trademark Office issued it.         And you're right.        They did.    But

4       what you're going to hear is they did not know about these

5       things.     They -- you're going to get information that the

6       Patent and Trademark Office did not have and did not get to

7       consider.

8                   So, again, I think the process is important, not that

9       I tell you the answer, but how are you going to make this

10      determination of whether or not -- when Metaswitch says Genband

11      infringes, how are you going to analyze that as a jury and a

12      juror?

13                  We're going to bring an expert.           He's going to sit in

14      that chair.     He's going to give you more detail than you

15      wanted.     And I'm going to make a suggestion to you, a

16      recommendation.      And I'm not telling you how to do your

17      business as a jury, but there are 10 patents here, a lot of

18      information.

19                  One thing I would suggest to you is, when we put an

20      expert up there to talk about why we do not infringe, if we're

21      talking about the '273 patent and Claim 18, I would recommend

22      to you that you turn to that claim in your notebook and follow

23      along as the expert tells you about the patent and why we don't

24      infringe.

25                  And what you'll see is what the Court has told you.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 63 of 129 PageID #: 61348 63



1       If there is one word or element missing, in other words, if our

2       product doesn't do exactly what their patent says, then there

3       is no infringement.

4                    And so what I would suggest to you is, as you listen

5       to the expert, if you have the claim language open, if he

6       proves to you and we prove to you that that element is not met,

7       you can just put an X through it in your notebook.                And you

8       might make a notation in the margin about what you heard that

9       convinced you that you should put an X through it.

10                   And here's why I make that suggestion to you.              I've

11      done this for about over 20 years now, and I've talked to a lot

12      of jurors.     With 10 patents, the first questions you're going

13      to be asked when you go back in the jury room, the Judge is

14      going to submit the question to you, and it's going to say:

15      Does Genband infringe the Metaswitch '273 patent?

16                   And if you're like me, you're going to say:             Lord,

17      which one was the '273?        Because you're going to have a lot of

18      numbers.

19                   If you've made these notes and you've put an X when

20      we prove it, you can flip to the patent and the claim, which is

21      exactly how the Judge will ask you the question, and if you've

22      got an X, you know that the answer to that question is:                 No, we

23      do not infringe.

24                   Again, I'm not telling you how to do your business,

25      but that's a suggestion just because of the amount of
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 64 of 129 PageID #: 61349 64



1       information that you're going to have.

2                   For some of these claims, you'll see you'll have

3       multiple Xs.      We'll prove to you that there are several

4       different parts of this that we don't do.             For some you may

5       only -- have only one X.         But either way that means that

6       Genband does not infringe.

7                   Let me talk briefly about these other patents that

8       that -- that Metaswitch is asserting.

9                   The '522 patent.       What's important about -- or one

10      thing that's important about the '522 is that Metaswitch has a

11      product -- and this will be a recurring theme.               You remember

12      they don't use this '273 patent.

13                  And I don't know if you saw their -- their slide, but

14      they're going to tell you that the '273 patent is worth $38

15      million.    They -- they're going to claim that's the value, a

16      patent that they don't use and they have not used and sold

17      commercially.

18                  It's the same thing with the '522.            They're going to

19      tell you these patents are worth millions of dollars.                They

20      have a product, but they do not use their patent in their own

21      product.    And I heard Metaswitch's lawyers say to you:               Well,

22      that's irrelevant.       It doesn't matter.

23                  Well, think about what else he told you.              He told you

24      what you're trying to determine here, if you ever get to the

25      question of damages, is what's the value of the patent.                 Well,
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 65 of 129 PageID #: 61350 65



1       if no one's using it, and Metaswitch itself is not using it,

2       you'd have to ask how much value does it have.               And that's

3       where we get back to common sense.

4                   And it's the same thing with the '768 patent.               You're

5       going to hear that they have a product, the server product.

6       Again, they don't use it.         This -- this is the product that

7       relates to voicemail.        They have a voicemail system, but they

8       don't even use their '768 patent that they're going to try to

9       tell you is worth millions of dollars.

10                  The '640 patent, this one is a little different.

11      They actually do have a product that they claim they have put

12      the '640 patent into.        What they didn't tell you in opening is

13      no one uses that feature.

14                  And that's what -- that's what the evidence is going

15      to show you in this case.         Although they have the feature in

16      their product, they're not aware -- aware of a single customer,

17      not a single customer who has ever used that feature.                So,

18      again, how valuable is it?

19                  THE COURT:      Five minutes remaining.

20                  MR. DACUS:      Thank you, Your Honor.

21                  Finally, the '482 and '282 patents.            And it, again,

22      is the same story.       They have a gateway product just like that

23      original Genband product.         This '482 and '282 relates to the

24      gateway products, but Metaswitch does not use either of these

25      patents in its own products.

1                   Now, let me say just a couple of things with -- with

2       respect to damages.       If the evidence proves to you that, in

3       fact, Metaswitch uses the Genband patents, it's your job to

4       determine what is a fair value for their use of these patents

5       for this number of -- for these years that they've used them.

6                   And the way you go about doing that is what -- you'll

7       hear a term called a hypothetical negotiation.               And what that

8       means is you, as jurors -- and we'll have an expert to come and

9       lay out the evidence for you -- you are to determine what these

10      people would have negotiated for the right to have permission

11      to use our patents.

12                  If Metaswitch had done the right thing and come to us

13      and said, hey, we're going to use your patents; how much do we

14      need to pay you, what would these people have negotiated?

15                  And we'll walk through the evidence as to what value

16      they received.      In the end, it's going to -- the evidence is

17      going to show you essentially what I've told you, and that is

18      that the '667 patent, they saved millions of dollars using it,

19      and as a result, the damages are a substantial amount of money,

20      some $2.8 million.

21                  With respect to the '252 and the '210, they've

22      made -- they've saved money, made money, but not as much.

23                  And finally with respect to the '006, they're right.

24      It's not the most profitable patent.            They haven't made a lot

25      of money on it.      And as a result, the reasonable royalty says
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 67 of 129 PageID #: 61352 67



1       that the amount of money should be less.

2                    Now, if you were to get to a point of deciding that

3       Genband uses Metaswitch's patents and you're making a decision

4       of what amount of money is Metaswitch entitled to, they taught

5       us in law school not to use extreme words like "ridiculous" or

6       "absurd."     So I'm not going to use those words.

7                    But I'm going to tell you that what they asked for is

8       unreasonable.      It's unreasonable.       And we'll -- we'll explain

9       that as we go along, why it's unreasonable.

10                   In the end, I think the evidence will show you that

11      Metaswitch's products use and infringe Genband's patents.

12      Genband's patents are valid.          The patents are valuable.         And

13      that they owe some $3.3 million for the use of those patents.

14                   I'm going to sit down now, and the process, as the

15      Judge explained, is for the next four or so days, we're going

16      to present evidence to you.         We're going to try to do our job

17      so that in the end, you can do yours.

18                   I'm going to thank you in advance for your attention,

19      and as I said, it's going to require significant attention on

20      your part.

21                   At the end, the lawyers will have a chance to -- to

22      talk to you again in closing arguments, but until that time,

23      let me say thank you, and I appreciate your attention this

24      morning.

25                   Thank you, Your Honor.

1                    THE COURT:     All right.     Having now heard opening

2       statements from counsel, if you're present in the courtroom and

3       expect to testify as a witness in this case, I'm going to ask

4       you to come forward collectively.           We'll administer the oath at

5       one time, and that will save us some time swearing each witness

6       in individually as we go through the trial.

7                    If you'll come forward, Ms. Lockhart, our courtroom

8       deputy will administer the oath to all the witnesses present at

9       this time.

10                   Counsel, and if there are witnesses who aren't sworn

11      at this time that appear later in trial, I'll trust you to

12      remind me so that we can swear them individually.

13                   All right.     Ms. Lockhart.

14                   (Witnesses sworn.)

15                   THE COURT:     Thank you.

16                   You may return to your seats.

17                   Counsel, does either party wish to invoke the Rule?

18                   MR. VERHOEVEN:      Yes, Your Honor.

19                   MR. DACUS:     The Defendant does, Your Honor.          And we

20      would ask for the exception for experts and the corporate

21      representative, Your Honor.

22                   THE COURT:     All right.     The Rule has been invoked,

23      which means that unless you are designated as an expert witness

24      to testify in this case or unless you are the designated

25      corporate representative of one of the parties, then you should
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 69 of 129 PageID #: 61354 69



1       remain outside the courtroom during the testimony and only be

2       brought into -- or only come into the courtroom at the time

3       you're called to testify.

4                   So if you're present and you're not an expert witness

5       or a corporate representative, when the first witness is

6       called, you should make sure that from that time forward,

7       you're outside the courtroom until your time to testify comes

8       about.

9                   (Witnesses leave the courtroom.)

10                  THE COURT:      Ladies and gentlemen, before we have the

11      Plaintiff call their first witness, we've been in session over

12      a couple hours now, and we're going to take a short recess.

13                  This is one of those opportunities where, if you'll

14      just simply close your notebooks, you may leave them in your

15      chairs.    I remind you not to discuss the case or anything

16      you've heard among yourselves.

17                  Also, ladies and gentlemen, you heard some argument

18      during opening about keeping up with the various patents in

19      this case, and there are 10 separate patents-in-suit, but I

20      remind you of my earlier instruction not to make any decisions

21      in this case until you've heard all the evidence.

22                  All right.      With that, the jury's excused for a short

23      recess.

24                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise for the jury.

25                  (Jury out.)
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 70 of 129 PageID #: 61355 70



1                   THE COURT:      All right.     Be seated, please.

2                   Mr. Dacus, where is Mr. Kubehl?           He is identified as

3       the lead counsel for the Defendant.            He's not been present

4       throughout opening statements.           He's not asked for leave of the

5       Court not to be present.         Can you explain to me where your lead

6       counsel is?

7                   MR. DACUS:      Our understanding is, Your Honor, we

8       filed a notice of change of lead counsel.             And so if it's not

9       reflected on the Court's records, that's our apology, but we --

10      our understanding has been that we filed a notice of change of

11      lead counsel.

12                  THE COURT:      He was here during jury selection.

13      Nobody mentioned it to me.

14                  MR. DACUS:      He was not here during jury selection.

15                  THE COURT:      I thought he was.       I could be mistaken.

16      But I was not aware that you had attempted to change your lead

17      counsel.

18                  MR. DACUS:       Our understanding -- and that's

19      certainly my understanding, Mr. Pankratz had been designated as

20      lead counsel, Your Honor.

21                  THE COURT:      All right.     Well, it may have been a

22      miscommunication, but it's -- it's certainly not proper for

23      lead counsel not to be present in the courtroom without leave

24      of the Court.

25                  Mr. Pankratz, having had this discussion, you're now
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 71 of 129 PageID #: 61356 71



1       lead counsel for the Defendant, and we'll go forward on that

2       basis.

3                   MR. PANKRATZ:      Thank you, Your Honor.

4                   THE COURT:      Mr. Dacus, twice in your opening, you

5       referred to Mr. Mills simply as Brendon.             You know that's not

6       permitted in this court.         You went back to Mr. Mills after

7       doing it twice.      I just remind you and other counsel that the

8       Court does not permit reference to individuals by first names

9       only.

10                  MR. DACUS:      Understood, Your Honor.

11                  THE COURT:      All right.     We stand in recess for the

12      next few minutes.

13                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

14                  (Recess.)

15                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

16                  THE COURT:      Be seated, please.

17                  Is the Plaintiff prepared to call their first

18      witness?

19                  MR. MANN:     Yes, Your Honor.

20                  THE COURT:      All right.     Let's bring in the jury,

21      Mr. Johnston.

22                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise for the jury.

23                  (Jury in.)

24                  THE COURT:      Please be seated.

25                  Plaintiff, you may call your first witness.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 72 of 129 PageID #: 61357 72



1                    MR. MANN:    Your Honor, we call Al Mitchell to the

2       stand.

3                    THE COURT:     All right.

4                    MR. MANN:    And, Your Honor, I do have exhibits that

5       we'll be introducing.        They are the patents.        I don't know if

6       the Court needs another copy of those.            There's a copy --

7                    THE COURT:     No.   No.    But, counsel, if you have

8       witness materials for the Court, just pass them out when you

9       call the witness.

10                   MR. MANN:    Okay.

11                   THE COURT:     There's no need to go through a formal

12      procedure.

13                   All right.     This witness has been sworn.

14                   Mr. Mann, you may proceed.

15                   MR. MANN:    Thank you, Your Honor.         May it please the

16      Court.

17          ALISTAIR MITCHELL, PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS, PREVIOUSLY SWORN,

18                                  DIRECT EXAMINATION

19      BY MR. MANN:

20      Q       Good morning, Mr. Mitchell.        Would you introduce yourself

21      to the jury, please, sir?

22      A       My name is Alistair Mitchell.

23      Q       All right.   And where do you work, Mr. Mitchell?

24      A       I work for Metaswitch Networks, the Plaintiff in this

25      case.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 73 of 129 PageID #: 61358 73



1       Q     All right.     And where do you live?

2       A     I live in -- in Edinburgh, in Scotland.

3       Q     And do you work there?

4       A     Yes, I do.     I work out of our office in Edinburgh.             I also

5       travel to our other offices.

6       Q     Okay.    And you might pull that microphone just a little

7       closer.

8       A     Is that better?

9       Q     I think so.

10            Would you mind sharing with us a little information about

11      your family?

12      A     Sure.    I live in Edinburgh with my wife of 10 years and

13      three small children.        We have a daughter, age five; son, age

14      four; and our youngest daughter is nine months.

15      Q     Okay.    And what's your job title at Metaswitch?

16      A     I am the Senior Vice President of Engineering.

17      Q     And when you -- when you're talking about a company like

18      Metaswitch, what kind of company is it?

19      A     Well, Metaswitch is primarily and always has been a

20      software research and development company.             We make products

21      for network operators primarily in the telecommunication space.

22      Q     Okay.    And what kind of network are you talking about?

23      A     So I'm talking about phone networks, telecom networks.

24      And our products help telephone companies move from old style

25      telephone networks to the new style VoIP networks.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 74 of 129 PageID #: 61359 74



1       Q     All right.     And can you tell us a little bit how the jury

2       or any of us may run into or use the products that you sell to

3       the telecoms, the telephone companies?

4       A     Sure.    So members of the jury might use our products

5       unknowingly every time you make a telephone call.               So we are

6       not the phone company, but phone companies buy our equipment

7       and that enables them to connect phone calls together, of

8       course, from one phone to another.

9       Q     Okay.    And does that have to do with VoIP or Voice over

10      Internet Protocol?

11      A     Yes, it does.

12      Q     Okay.    Can you -- can you explain a little bit about Voice

13      over Internet Protocol, what that is from your perspective?

14      A     Sure.    Well, as the jury knows more about this morning,

15      Internet networks have, you know, grown up rapidly over the

16      last 20 years.

17            And what VoIP is, is it's effectively the ability to take

18      voice data -- instead of having a special copper network, just

19      for -- for phone calls, to take that voice, turn it into data

20      and transmit it over an Internet network in order to get that

21      from one place to another.

22            And that's better for phone companies because building

23      Internet networks, building just one type of network is cheaper

24      than having to maintain multiple types of network, and it's

25      faster and enables more services.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 75 of 129 PageID #: 61360 75



1       Q     Okay.     And can you tell us a little bit about your

2       background in VoIP or Voice over Internet Protocol?

3       A     Sure.     I worked in Voice over IP for 14 years, my whole

4       career.     I have written computer software for Voice over IP

5       products.      I've led engineering teams.        I worked in my customer

6       support teams here in the U.S. in looking -- after 3- or 400

7       customers deploying these complex products.

8             During that time, I've educated engineers, educated

9       customers, given seminars at conferences, and I am also a

10      coinventor on a VoIP patent.

11      Q     Okay.     And does that patent have anything to do with

12      today?

13      A     No.     That patent is not at issue in this case today.

14      Q     Okay.     Now, in your time at Metaswitch for the 14 years,

15      tell us, before that, your educational background.

16      A     Sure.     I went to school at Cambridge in England, and my

17      postgraduate degree was in computer science.

18      Q     Okay.     And tell us just a little bit -- we've heard in

19      opening, but -- but tell us a little bit about where Metaswitch

20      is located and kind of how it's -- it's grown up.

21      A     Sure.     So Metaswitch has been around since 1981.            We've

22      got offices in the U.S. -- in the UK.            Main offices in the U.S.

23      are in San Francisco, where our chief executive is based; in

24      Richardson here in Texas; and in Reston, Virginia.

25            And then in the UK, we've got our main offices in London
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 76 of 129 PageID #: 61361 76



1       or just north of London and in Edinburgh, Scotland.                We've had

2       offices here in the U.S. since about 1982, I think, our first

3       office in Reston, Virginia, and we do most of our business here

4       in the U.S.

5       Q     Okay.    And then what are your responsibilities as the

6       Senior Vice President of Engineering at Metaswitch?

7       A     So I oversee all research and development activities at

8       Metaswitch.     That means on a day-to-day basis, I'm overseeing,

9       making sure that my teams are producing products to the right

10      quality, making sure they're coming out on time, and discussing

11      with customers how our products are -- are serving them and

12      what else they might want to see in our products.

13            And I also get to advise other parts of the company on

14      what our product strategy should be and what future product

15      direction we might want to go into.

16      Q     Now, would that have included your day-to-day activities?

17      Would that -- is that what you just covered, also?

18      A     I did, yes.

19      Q     All right.     And now you're here testifying as the company

20      representative, correct?

21      A     That is correct.       But also as one of the many employee

22      owners of the company.        I'm keen to protect our patented

23      technology.

24      Q     Okay.    Now, you've -- can you give us a little more detail

25      on the history of the company and how it started?

1                     THE COURT:     Let me ask you to do this, Mr. Mitchell,

2       before you answer that.         Pull the microphone a little closer.

3                     THE WITNESS:     I'm sorry, Your Honor.

4                     THE COURT:     You turn your head away from it when you

5       answer, and I want to make sure everyone in the courtroom can

6       hear you.

7                     THE WITNESS:     Maybe if I do that --

8                     THE COURT:     All right.    Go ahead and answer the

9       question.

10      Q     (By Mr. Mann) Okay.        Go ahead, Mr. Mitchell.

11      A     So the history of the company, obviously, we were founded

12      30-some years ago.         The world -- the telecommunications space

13      was a little bit different then, and as a company, what we were

14      doing then was selling pieces of software technology to larger

15      vendors to incorporate in their own products.

16            In about 1999, we decided to produce our own hardware and

17      software products for the telecommunications industry

18      ourselves.

19      Q     Okay.     And is there a concentration now, or can you tell

20      us maybe a difference now what the company is now versus then?

21      Has there been a change?

22      A     Yeah, absolutely.

23            So rather than what we used to do in terms of selling

24      equipment to other companies, now we -- we produce our own

25      equipment, but also because the tran -- the -- the change in
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 78 of 129 PageID #: 61363 78



1       the industry is being to move away from all our communications,

2       being over faxes and phones and now being over Internet, cell

3       phones, computers, tablets, then you need new networks, new

4       mechanisms of communication and new equipment to help support

5       those networks.

6       Q     All right.     Now, I want to -- have you helped prepare some

7       slides today to help with your presentation?

8       A     Yes, I have.

9       Q     All right.     And -- and tell us what this slide represents,

10      Mr. Mitchell.

11      A     So the majority of Metaswitch's customers today are fairly

12      small rural telephone companies in the U.S.              And this is just

13      an example of some of the smaller towns in Texas served by some

14      of our customers who are rural phone companies.

15            So as an example, Blossom Communications, Blossom is just

16      south of Paris north of here.          They serve town -- a few

17      communities around them.

18      Q     Okay.    And then what about regional carriers, those that

19      may be slightly smaller -- I mean slightly larger?                I'm sorry.

20      A     Yeah.    Well, we have customers all over the U.S.             Like I

21      said, a majority of our customers are here.

22            In addition to those small, rural carriers, then we have

23      customers such as FairPoint, Suddenlink, or Jaguar

24      Communications in -- in the northern part of the country.

25      Q     Okay.    Now, tell us on this demonstrative that we have, is
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 79 of 129 PageID #: 61364 79



1       this something that you helped put together for us to do your

2       presentation?

3       A       Yes, it is.

4       Q       Let's -- let's start off with just looking at this

5       demonstrative as a whole.         What does it represent?

6       A       Well, this is representing a -- sort of a typical network

7       that one of our smaller rural -- rural phone companies might

8       put together using our equipment to help deliver services to

9       their customers.

10      Q       Okay.   Now, if I can, if I can ask you a few areas to go

11      into like -- let's say right here over that direction, what

12      does this represent with the farm and the poles and lines?

13      A       Well, what we've got there is, if we look here where I put

14      a dot there, that represents a -- sort of a rural community or

15      rural farm, rather, connected to that teleco using these --

16      these poles and wires here.         So that represents an old style

17      telephone connection.

18      Q       Okay.   And where you have rural telco, what does that

19      represent?

20      A       So that represents -- this is a -- a building of some

21      representation that shows the main central office of our rural

22      telco here where they provide the majority of their service

23      to -- to their subscribers.

24      Q       Okay.   And what is this -- I'll call it a box.            What is

25      that?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 80 of 129 PageID #: 61365 80



1       A     That is a media gateway.

2       Q     All right.     And is that in the telco building?

3       A     That's right.      That's in the telco building.          It's a box

4       about 2 feet high by a foot-and-a-half wide.              So it looks

5       enormous in that picture, but it's -- but it's not that big.

6       Q     All right.     And then if we -- sorry -- if we move down

7       this blue line, what is that?

8       A     So that is an application server.           And an application

9       server is effectively the brains of a -- of a Voice over IP

10      system.    It tells the media gateway, which is in charge of

11      connecting to old style phone networks, as well as Internet

12      networks -- that application server tells the media gateway

13      where it should send calls and how it should reach its

14      destination and what services it should apply to them.

15      Q     Okay.    And -- and where we can get an idea of size, what

16      is the size of that box?

17      A     That box is sort of 2 or 3 inches high and a -- and a

18      foot-and-a-half wide.        So, again, quite small.

19      Q     Okay.    And then all the blue lines, what do they

20      represent?

21      A     Those are -- those represent Internet connections, so they

22      might be carried over -- over WiFi over the air or over 3 or 4G

23      or a cable or even DSL.

24      Q     Okay.    And then if we go out this building, what is this

25      session border controller?         What is that?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 81 of 129 PageID #: 61366 81



1       A       What that is, is it's effectively a -- a special voice

2       security device.       And it -- because the application server and

3       the media gateway, which are very important pieces of

4       infrastructure, very expensive pieces of equipment, because

5       they're connected to the Internet, then we want to stop hackers

6       from reaching them.

7               So that is a security device that that voice goes through

8       and then also helps them route them over the right parts of the

9       Internet, but yet stop hackers on the Internet from -- from

10      getting into the sensitive pieces of equipment inside.

11      Q       Okay.   And quickly, what is the Internet service provider

12      up here?

13      A       Well, that's a depiction of how rural teleco reaches the

14      rest of the world with -- with their Internet connection.                 So

15      that -- that's an Internet backbone connection, if you will,

16      how they reach the rest of the world, because rural telco

17      obviously doesn't have Internet fibers to everywhere in the

18      world.     It has it up to the next point.

19      Q       Okay.   And then lastly, if -- if I were in this building

20      here or this farm trying to make a phone call to you up here in

21      Dallas, how would that work through this system?

22      A       Sure.   So, you know, they got your phone, which will be an

23      old style phone because you've got the -- the old style phone

24      lines here.      And that signal would reach the media gateway

25      here.     And the media gateway would ask the application server
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 82 of 129 PageID #: 61367 82



1       what to do with that incoming telephone call.

2             So it's got information about the number you want to reach

3       and what network you're attached to.            And that application

4       server will talk to the media gateway, and it will -- it may

5       decide to -- to send the call out here over the Internet or it

6       may decide to use these old style phone wires to Dallas.

7       Whichever way, it will do so.

8             It would send the call to Dallas, and then some other

9       phone company system will receive that call and send it to me

10      or my cell phone if I was in the Dallas at the time.

11      Q     Okay.     Now, is there anyone else selling products like --

12      well, let me back up.

13                    These -- these boxes, are these products that

14      Metaswitch sells?

15      A     Yes, they are.

16      Q     All right.     Who else -- or is there anybody else that

17      sells these type of products?

18      A     Genband is -- is -- is one such company.             I mean, the

19      telecommunication space is a very, very big space.                For -- you

20      know, for the first sort of 10 years, the early 2000s when we

21      were in this space, we were targeting a fairly small part of

22      that telecommunications market.           And Genband was one of the

23      number of other small companies competing for that market,

24      along with us.

25                    As you heard, in about 2010, Genband acquired this
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 83 of 129 PageID #: 61368 83



1       much bigger company, Nortel, an arm of Nortel.               And at that

2       point, they became very much more enormous competitor for us to

3       deal with.

4       Q     And who is or who was Nortel?

5       A     Nortel was this very, very big telecommunications company

6       based in Canada a while ago.          And during the downturn in about

7       2008, they went bankrupt.         And that caused some of that --

8       their arms and assets to get bought up by other companies.

9       Q     All right.     Well, was -- in -- in Scotland, do they have

10      the saying "the 800-pound gorilla"?            Do you know what that is?

11      A     I know what an 800-pound gorilla is.

12      Q     Was Nortel the 800-pound gorilla?

13      A     It might have been slightly bigger.

14      Q     Okay.     Now, let's move to this slide.         What does this

15      represent on this slide?

16      A     This slide represents the -- the six Metaswitch patents at

17      issue in this case.

18      Q     Okay.     And does Metaswitch own these patents?

19      A     Yes.     Metaswitch owns these.

20      Q     Does Metaswitch own other patents besides these?

21      A     Yes.     Metaswitch owns lots of other patents.

22      Q     Okay.     Now, if -- if I can, I'd like to first talk about

23      the '640 patent with you, okay?

24                    And this is in the jurors' notebooks but also

25      PX-2011.      Can you tell us what this '640 patent is and what it
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 84 of 129 PageID #: 61369 84



1       does?

2       A       Sure.   At Metaswitch, we call this our SBC smart media

3       writing patent.        It was invented by, as you see here, a number

4       of Metaswitch developers.         They're all still at the company.            I

5       know them well.

6       Q       Okay.   And what does it do?

7       A       Basically, what it does is allows a session border

8       controller, which is that security device I showed you earlier,

9       to -- to route voice calls over the Internet more efficiently.

10      Q       Okay.   And then these two patents -- first of all, are

11      they -- were they invented at Metaswitch?

12      A       They were invented at Metaswitch, and this person here,

13      Chris Mairs, was actually one of our founders in 1981.

14      Q       Okay.   Going back one -- the '640 patent, was it invented

15      at Metaswitch?

16      A       Yes, it was.

17      Q       All right.     Now, tell us, just at a high level, what the

18      '522 patent is and what it does.

19      A       Sure.   What the '522 patent does is it allows you to

20      appear as a single number to someone you're calling, even if

21      you call from multiple devices.

22              So maybe you call from your office line and sometimes you

23      call from your cell phone line, but you want the person on the

24      other end of the -- the telephone always to see that it's you

25      and have one number they can always reach you at.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 85 of 129 PageID #: 61370 85



1             So they see your incoming caller ID as being the same

2       number regardless of which phone you use.

3       Q     All right.     And then the '768 patent, what is it, and what

4       does it do?

5       A     Well, again, if you're using multiple devices, which many

6       of us do, then today, most of those devices have their own

7       voicemail system for receiving messages when people call you.

8       It'd be a lot more useful to have all your messages going to

9       one mailbox, so that's what this patent describes.

10      Q     Okay.    And that is -- the '522 patent is Exhibit 2009, and

11      the '768 patent is Plaintiff's Exhibit 2007, correct?

12      A     That is correct.

13      Q     Let's go to the next two patents.

14            The '482 patent, which is Exhibit 2003, what is it and

15      what does it do?

16      A     So what these two patents are, are two patents that we

17      actually acquired from a company called App Trigger, which was

18      founded here in -- in -- in Texas, in Richardson, actually.

19            And actually both of these patents describe a -- an

20      intelligent media gateway which, again, can -- can make some

21      intelligent decisions about how it routes its calls around

22      the -- the phone network.

23      Q     Okay.    And that would be Exhibits 2003 and 2005, correct?

24      A     That's correct.

25      Q     All right.     Now, can you tell us a little bit more about
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 86 of 129 PageID #: 61371 86



1       App Trigger, just a little more detail?

2       A     Sure.    App Trigger was founded in 2001 here in Texas by

3       actually the three guys who are the inventors of both of these

4       patents, Mark Crutcher, Randy Waters, and Craig Miller.

5             And that company was rather like Metaswitch, engaged in

6       trying to invent technology -- inventing technology to help

7       telecommunications companies evolve their networks from old

8       style to -- to new style networks.

9       Q     Okay.    And then the network slide, the '273 patent, which

10      is Exhibit 2001, can you tell us what this is and what it does?

11      A     Sure.    So this patent, again, is about helping

12      communications companies move from old style networks to new

13      style networks, and this, as has been described earlier, helps

14      a tele -- telecom company who's got a big old legacy switch,

15      legacy system, helps them to move to a more modern system, but

16      reuse some of the interface frames that have those tens of

17      thousands or hundreds of thousands of copper lines coming into

18      it, so allows it -- effectively allowing a brain transplant of

19      their old system and putting in the brains of a new system that

20      allows communications over Voice over IP networks.

21      Q     Okay.    And the inventor here shows to be David Smith.                  Did

22      you know him, or do you know him?

23      A     Yes.    I know David Smith very well.

24      Q     Can you tell us anything about him, some background?

25      A     Sure.    I mean, he's a brilliant self-taught inventor.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 87 of 129 PageID #: 61372 87



1       Didn't actually go to college.          He worked for a couple of big

2       telecoms companies, and he left them to go pursue his own --

3       own ideas.

4             He's one of those guys you might think of as an

5       irrepressible entrepreneur.         And he set up a company called New

6       Class Five, which I think you've heard a little about.                 And

7       while he was there, he invented this patent, along with a

8       number of other products.         And a few years ago, we acquired a

9       number of assets from that company, including this patent, and

10      David Smith came to work for us at that time.

11      Q     Okay.    Would that have included a product called CAP5

12      or -- CAP5?

13      A     That's right, included some technology called CAP5.

14      Q     Okay.    Now, does -- Metaswitch still owns this patent?

15      A     Yes, we do.

16      Q     And has there been any product made by Metaswitch that has

17      been fully developed using this '273 patented technology?

18      A     We've never fully developed a product.             We produced a -- a

19      prototype, which we showed to a customer under a nondisclosure

20      agreement.     And we basically found lots more work to do and

21      paused it at that point.

22      Q     All right.     Was it ever commercialized?

23      A     It was never commercialized.

24      Q     Okay.    And -- and why didn't Metaswitch fully develop the

25      prototype?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 88 of 129 PageID #: 61373 88



1       A       Well, we -- we demonstrated the working technology but

2       producing a working product in the telecommunication space is a

3       very expensive and time-consuming thing to do because you're

4       talking about products that have to be always on, they have to

5       always work, and they have to be entirely redundant, which

6       means that if some part of it fails, there must -- there must

7       be another part that continues to work so that whatever time of

8       day or night customers can -- can make 911 calls, for example.

9               It's critically important.        And it was going to be very

10      expensive for us to take that product to -- to completion at

11      that time, and we didn't have the resources to do it at that

12      time.

13      Q       Okay.

14      A       And we --

15      Q       I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to interrupt.          Were you through?

16      A       Well, I was going to say that, you know, what we wanted to

17      do was to find a lead customer who would help pay us to -- to

18      develop the -- the final hurdle of getting this prototype into

19      market.

20              But at this point, we hadn't found a customer willing

21      to -- to -- to commit to helping us to develop that product and

22      paying us the money we needed to finish it.

23      Q       And did you look for anyone else to fund or help develop

24      the funding for the product?

25      A       We didn't look outside of -- of customers.            We didn't want

1       to burden ourselves with extra debt.            You know, we wanted to

2       maintain as much independence for ourselves as possible.

3       Q     And is independence important to Metaswitch as a company?

4       A     Yes, it is.      I mean, actually, as an example of that, a

5       few years ago, Genband actually came and tried to -- to -- to

6       propose a merger with us, but, you know...

7       Q     And did the merger fall through?

8       A     No.   We didn't -- we didn't go ahead with the merger.

9       We -- we wanted to stay independent and -- and grow our own

10      technology and follow our own path.

11      Q     All right.     Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.         I appreciate that.

12                  MR. MANN:     I pass the witness, Your Honor.

13                  THE COURT:      All right.     Cross-examination by the

14      Defendants.

15                  MR. DACUS:      Thank you, Your Honor.

16                                   CROSS-EXAMINATION

17      BY MR. DACUS:

18      Q     Good morning, Mr. Mitchell.

19      A     Good morning.

20      Q     Before Metaswitch brought this lawsuit, sir, it did not

21      provide any sort of notice to Genband related to this alleged

22      infringement, correct?

23      A     Genband certainly knew of at least one of these patents,

24      and Genband's potential to infringe them, I believe.

25      Q     My question is a little different, sir, and it is that
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 90 of 129 PageID #: 61375 90



1       Metaswitch did not provide any sort of notice to Genband that

2       it believed Genband was infringing, correct?

3       A     No, I don't believe so.

4       Q     Okay.    What I said is correct?

5       A     That's correct.

6       Q     It did not send a letter, for example, to Genband saying:

7       Hey, we think we've got a problem, and you're infringing our

8       patent.    It did not do anything of the sort, correct?

9       A     Not prior to this lawsuit, no.

10      Q     Okay.    Now, I don't have the diagram that you showed the

11      jury where you showed them there was different components of

12      the telco system, like the gateway, the server, the session

13      border controller, but I understood you to be telling the jury

14      that those are important parts of the telecommunication system.

15            Did I understand that correctly?

16      A     Yes, you did.

17      Q     Okay.    And -- and the truth is, sir, that all those pieces

18      of equipment that you pointed out to the jury, Metaswitch sells

19      those, correct?

20      A     That is correct.

21      Q     Yet none of the patents in this suit does Metaswitch

22      include in those very important pieces of equipment, correct?

23      A     We do include one of the patents, yes.

24      Q     Which one?

25      A     The '640 SBC patent.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 91 of 129 PageID #: 61376 91



1       Q     Okay.    So other than the '640, none of the other patents

2       are included in that very important equipment, correct?

3       A     Not at this time.

4       Q     Okay.    Genband, as you said, does sell that type of

5       equipment also, correct?

6       A     That is correct.

7       Q     And you know that the Genband patents-in-suit are, in

8       fact, included in its equipment, correct?

9       A     The ones in this suit, yes.

10      Q     Okay.    Now, in the '80s and '90s, Metaswitch did not sell

11      gateways, correct?

12      A     That is correct.

13      Q     It didn't sell softswitches, correct?

14      A     They didn't exist in the '80s and '90s to my knowledge,

15      so, no, we didn't sell them.

16      Q     Okay.    It didn't sell the servers that you pointed out on

17      your diagram in the '80s and '90s, correct?

18      A     Correct.

19      Q     That is something that Metaswitch began selling in the

20      2000s, true?

21      A     In the very early 2000s, that's correct.

22      Q     Right.     Then the first softswitch it sold in 2002, does

23      that sound right?

24      A     I think the very first softswitch we actually sold prior

25      to that, it might have been 2000 or 2001.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 92 of 129 PageID #: 61377 92



1       Q     Okay.    The first server you sold in 2004.            Does that sound

2       correct?

3       A     The first server?       Could you be a little clearer?

4       Q     Did you say the application server that you pointed to?

5       A     The application server, yes, that would be right.

6       Q     Okay.    And at the time that Metaswitch entered the market,

7       people like Genband and Nortel were already selling these types

8       of equipment and products on the market, correct?

9       A     Nortel at the time was selling the legacy equipment I

10      think we described.       I don't know to the extent which

11      Metaswitch or Genband entered the market first.

12      Q     Okay.    And I heard you say earlier that you -- you went to

13      university or college at Cambridge, correct?

14      A     That is correct.

15      Q     When you did get out?        I didn't hear you say that.

16      A     2001.

17      Q     Okay.    So you went directly from college to Metaswitch?

18      A     Yes, I did.

19      Q     And you began working on these products that Metaswitch

20      was developing to try and sell; is that correct?

21      A     That is correct.

22      Q     Now, with respect to Metaswitch, how many employees does

23      it have in the British Isles?

24      A     It would be approximately 250, possibly 300.

25      Q     And how many in your Richardson office?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 93 of 129 PageID #: 61378 93



1       A     In our Richardson office, it will be 15, 20.

2       Q     And what about worldwide?

3       A     Worldwide, we have about 650, maybe 700 employees.

4       Q     And I understood you to tell the jury that Genband and

5       Metaswitch, of course, are competitors, correct?

6       A     That is correct.

7       Q     And I thought I understood you to say that once Genband

8       acquired the Nortel Voice over IP business, that competition

9       increased; is that a fair statement?

10      A     Certainly it would be fair to say that we found them to be

11      a much bigger and more formidable competitor.

12      Q     Yeah.    And one reason is because the assets that it bought

13      from Nortel are good assets, correct, in the Voice over IP

14      space?

15      A     I would have said the main reason was because Nortel was a

16      company with many tens of thousands of employees, and many,

17      many more customers, and a much bigger presence in the market.

18      Q     At one point in time, Metaswitch itself put in a bid to

19      try to buy those assets from Nortel, correct?

20      A     I think that's right, yes.

21      Q     And it was unsuccessful in doing so, right?

22      A     Certainly we decided not to go through with that.

23      Q     Has -- after the filing of this lawsuit, has Metaswitch

24      attempted to change any of its products or design around any of

25      the patents-in-suit?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 94 of 129 PageID #: 61379 94



1       A       No, not to my knowledge.

2       Q       Now, with respect to the New Class Five Company, you were

3       there when Metaswitch bought those assets, correct?

4       A       Yes, I was.

5       Q       You were the Senior Vice President?

6       A       I was not the Senior Vice President at that time, no.

7       Q       But you did oversee the development of the product that

8       evolved from that purchase of the New Class Five assets; is

9       that true?

10      A       Certainly I oversaw our ongoing development of the

11      technology to be acquired from them.

12      Q       Okay.     And the -- the -- the name that you used inside

13      Metaswitch for that product is called a line frame adaptor; is

14      that right?

15      A       So it never actually turned into a product, but the

16      product we -- we were trying to aim for was going to be called

17      a line frame adaptor, yes.

18      Q       And sometimes you abbreviate that as LFA, if we see that

19      in a document; is that right?

20      A       That's correct.

21                      MR. DACUS:   Can you pull up DX-1561, Mr. Lodge?

22      Q       (By Mr. Dacus) DX-1561 is the asset purchase agreement.

23      It's the agreement between Metaswitch and -- and New Class

24      Five.

25              You understand that?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 95 of 129 PageID #: 61380 95



1       A     Yeah.

2       Q     Okay.

3                     MR. DACUS:    Can we go to Page 38, Mr. Lodge?

4                     If we look at Paragraph 5.5 and highlight that.

5       Q     (By Mr. Dacus) It says:         Buyer acknowledges that the

6       purchased assets do not include completed products and consist

7       primarily of patents and software in development.

8             Is that a true statement, sir?

9       A     That certainly is.

10      Q     Okay.     So at the time that Mr. Smith and New Class Five

11      sold their assets to Metaswitch, New Class Five had no

12      completed product; fair statement?

13      A     That's not a fair statement.          We didn't buy any completed

14      product.

15            So as you see here, this is an asset purchase agreement,

16      and we were purchasing some of the things that New Class Five

17      as a company owned.        They actually had developed other products

18      in the meantime that they were selling on the marketplace.                     We

19      didn't buy those.

20                    MR. DACUS:    Can we turn to DX-1561, 50 -- 59, please?

21      Q     (By Mr. Dacus) Is this a list of the assets that

22      Metaswitch bought from New Class Five?

23      A     Yes, it is.

24      Q     So that included what's listed there as the '273 patent,

25      correct?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 96 of 129 PageID #: 61381 96



1       A      That is correct.

2       Q      That's the patent-in-suit here?

3       A      That is.

4       Q      It also bought hardware designs, correct?

5       A      That is correct.

6       Q      It bought what's labeled there as reverse engineering --

7       specifically reverse engineering process document, correct?

8       A      That is correct.

9                   MR. DACUS:      And if we scroll down.

10                  Thank you, Mr. Lodge.

11      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) It bought what is labeled as a Nortel LCM

12      line frame, correct?

13      A      That is correct.

14      Q      Is that a piece of Nortel equipment?

15      A      It's manufactured by Nortel, yes.

16                  MR. DACUS:      If we could go to 1561, 40, please --

17      DX-1561.

18      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) Now, at the time of the purchase, it's --

19      it's true, Mr. Mitchell, that Metaswitch required that David

20      Smith enter into a non-compete agreement with Metaswitch,

21      correct?

22      A      That's pretty standard when you take on a new employee,

23      yes.

24      Q      So the answer is, Metaswitch did require a non-compete,

25      correct?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 97 of 129 PageID #: 61382 97



1       A      That is correct.

2                    MR. DACUS:     And if we go to DX-1561-157, and we look

3       at No. 5, please, Mr. Lodge.

4       Q      (By Mr. Dacus) It's also true that Metaswitch required

5       that Mr. Smith sign what's known as a non-disparagement

6       paragraph, correct?

7       A      That's correct.

8       Q      And that means that Metaswitch is requiring that Mr. Smith

9       not say anything derogatory or bad about Metaswitch, true?

10      A      That is true.

11      Q      And that is part of the agreement that he had to sign,

12      correct?

13      A      That's correct.

14                   MR. DACUS:     We can pull that down, Mr. Lodge.           Thank

15      you.

16      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) In return for this, Metaswitch agreed to

17      pay to New Class Five or has paid $450,000, correct?

18      A      That is correct.

19                   MR. DACUS:     If we could pull up 1561-17, please,

20      Mr. Lodge?

21      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) And while we're doing that, you know,

22      Mr. Mitchell, that although Metaswitch has paid 450,000, there

23      was potential for New Class Five and Mr. Smith to earn

24      additional money, correct?

25      A      Quite a lot more money, yes.
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 98 of 129 PageID #: 61383 98



1       Q     Okay.

2                     MR. DACUS:    And specifically, if we can look at

3       Paragraph 2.1.

4       Q     (By Mr. Dacus) The total amount that he could be paid was

5       $900,000, correct?

6       A     It was a bit more than that, actually.

7       Q     Okay.     The -- the part that he could be paid under

8       Paragraph 2.1 --

9       A     Was 900,000, yes, that's correct.

10                    MR. DACUS:    Now, can we go to look at Paragraph 2.2,

11      please, Mr. Lodge?

12                    Blow that up.    And specifically, if we can go down to

13      Subparagraph D and highlight that.

14      Q     (By Mr. Dacus) So do you remember, Mr. Mitchell, that New

15      Class Five and Mr. Smith could be paid an additional $450,000

16      if there was what's called a GA date reached?

17      A     That is correct.

18      Q     Okay.     And -- and you know, GA date is a common term used

19      in your business that means general -- generally available

20      date, correct?

21      A     That is correct.

22                    MR. DACUS:    And if we actually look at 1561-11,

23      Mr. Lodge.      We see a definition for GA date.          If you could blow

24      that up, please.

25      Q     (By Mr. Dacus) And you agree, Mr. Mitchell, that the GA
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 99 of 129 PageID #: 61384 99



1       date means the earlier of the buyer's announcement -- that's

2       Metaswitch's announcement -- of general availability of any

3       CAP5 product, correct?

4       A     That is correct.

5       Q     Or the first recognition of revenue, correct?

6       A     Correct.

7       Q     So if either one of those happens, Mr. Smith and CAP --

8       New Class Five are entitled to an additional 450,000; isn't

9       that fair?

10      A     That's fair.

11      Q     Okay.     Now, after --

12                    MR. DACUS:    You can pull that down, Mr. Lodge.

13      Q     (By Mr. Dacus) After Metaswitch acquired these assets, I

14      think you said that it -- it began to try to develop a product;

15      is that a fair statement?

16      A     We certainly developed the technology further, yes.

17      Q     Okay.     And were there some complications in trying to

18      develop it further?

19      A     I wouldn't say complications.          It was just more

20      time-consuming than at first we thought.

21      Q     Okay.     Did it cost more than at first you thought?

22      A     Yes.

23      Q     Okay.     But eventually, it is true that Metaswitch

24      announced that this line frame adapter product was generally

25      available, correct?

                                                                                 100



1      A      No.

2      Q      Okay.     You don't remember that?

3      A      We didn't announce that it was generally available.

4                     MR. DACUS:   Mr. Lodge, can you pull up CX-8, please?

5                     Can you -- there's a paragraph underneath "company

6      newsletter," the second full paragraph that begins "the major

7      highlight."

8      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) And before we do that, do you know who

9      Mr. John Lazar is, Mr. Mitchell?

10      A      Yes.     He's our former CEO.

11      Q      So he's the Chief Executive Officer, the highest ranking

12      person in the company, correct?

13      A      That is correct, yeah.

14      Q      And he -- this is dated March of 2013, correct?

15      A      Yeah.     It's an incoming email, yes.

16      Q      And is that something that he sends out, a periodic

17      newsletter, as the highest ranking officer in the company?

18      A      At that time, yes, he did that.

19                     MR. DACUS:   And so, Mr. Lodge, if we can pull that

20      down and look at the second paragraph that begins "the major"?

21      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) So what Mr. Lazar was telling the company

22      is that the major highlight, at least for now, is shipping the

23      first line frame adapters to customers, correct?

24      A      That refers to the event I discussed in my direct

25      testimony where we took some -- two prototype units to try at a

1      particular customer called Windstream under a non-disclosure

2      agreement.

3      Q      Okay.     And so is it your testimony that that's not being

4      generally available?

5      A      That is not being generally available, no.

6      Q      Now -- and is it your testimony that as of March 13th,

7      2013, the LFA product that you bought and developed from New

8      Class Five was not generally available?

9      A      It was not generally available.

10      Q      Okay.

11                     MR. DACUS:   Can we pull up CX-1, please?

12      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) Metaswitch has a board of directors, does

13      it not, sir?

14      A      It does, yes.

15      Q      And is it the same in England as it is here, that the

16      board of directors are -- really oversee all the management and

17      the operations of the company, such as Metaswitch?

18      A      Yes, at a high level.

19      Q      Okay.     And so they -- it's important to report to the

20      board of directors truthfully what's going on at the company.

21      You agree with that?

22      A      In the main, yes.

23      Q      Okay.     "In the main" meaning, yes?

24      A      Well, it's important to report truthfully.

25      Q      Okay.

                                                                                 102



1      A      But they get high-level facts.          They can't obviously

2      oversee every level of small detail in the company.

3      Q      And so what we're looking at here is an email from

4      Mr. Lazar to the board of directors dated October 15th of 2012,

5      correct?

6      A      That's correct.

7      Q      So that would be before the date we were looking at of

8      March 2013, correct?

9      A      Correct.

10      Q      When you said it's not generally available, fair?

11      A      Fair.

12                     MR. DACUS:   Now, can you pull up CX-2, Mr. Lodge?

13      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) Now, this was an attachment to that email

14      from Mr. Lazar where he's reporting to the board, and he calls

15      it a board status call.

16             Do you see that?

17      A      I see that.

18                     MR. DACUS:   Can you go to Slide 13, Mr. Lodge?

19                     And can you blow up the very last line?

20      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) And so what Mr. Lazar is reporting to the

21      board of directors in a truthful manner is that you have just

22      hit general GA, generally available, for line frame adaptor

23      solution for Nortel DMS, correct?

24             Did I read that, sir?

25      A      You did read that, yes.

1      Q      Okay.

2                     MR. DACUS:   You can pull that down, Mr. Lodge.

3      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) Now, the truth is, sir, this issue about

4      generally available, it's important to New Class Five and

5      Mr. Smith because it means they get an additional $450,000,

6      correct?

7      A      That is correct.

8      Q      And Metaswitch has never paid them that money, have they?

9      A      No, we haven't.

10      Q      And the fact is you knew way back in 2012 that you, in

11      fact, had said the product was generally available, correct?

12      A      I believe that statement there is wrong, that the product

13      was not generally available.

14      Q      Well, I'm -- I'm asking about a different statement, sir.

15      I'm asking about statements that you made back in 2012 that the

16      product was generally available.

17             Do you deny that?

18      A      General availability, an announcement of general

19      availability to customers was never made.

20                     MR. DACUS:   Can we pull up CX-82, please, Mr. Lodge?

21                     And if we could go to the end of that email string.

22      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) This is an email that was produced in this

23      lawsuit from a gentleman named Dave Reekie to you dated

24      May 14th of 2012.       Do you know Mr. Reekie?

25      A      I do.

1      Q      Does he work at Metaswitch?

2      A      He does.

3      Q      And so he says:      Al, as you know, in the New Class Five

4      contract, we owe them some money when the product goes GA.

5             Did I read that correctly?

6      A      You did.

7      Q      And do you -- I know your name is Alistair Mitchell, but

8      do you go by Al?

9      A      I do also go by Al.

10      Q      So this -- this email is directed to you, correct?

11      A      It is.

12                     MR. DACUS:   So can we go to the next page?

13                     Thank you.

14      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) And so you replied back to Mr. Reekie,

15      correct?

16      A      I did, yes.

17      Q      Okay.     It says -- if we go down to the "based on"

18      paragraph, and you say:         Based on my current understanding, the

19      trigger is due either on shipment of a product to a customer

20      for revenue or on declaration of the product as GA, correct?

21      A      From a customer perspective, I --

22      Q      Yeah, from a customer's perspective, correct?

23      A      Correct.

24                     MR. DACUS:   Okay.    Can we scroll up, Mr. Lodge?

25      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) And then you gave a further response to him
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 105 of 129 PageID #: 61390
                                                                                 105



1      in July of 2012 --

2      A      Yeah.

3      Q      -- where you quoted the GA date definition from the asset

4      purchase agreement, correct?

5      A      Yes.

6                     MR. DACUS:   And if you could scroll up, Mr. Lodge?

7                     A little bit more, please.

8      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) And so right -- right there in the middle

9      of the page --

10                     MR. DACUS:   Mr. Lodge, if you can blow up that

11      July 9th, 2012, 9:48 email.

12      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) So Mr. Reekie writes back to you and says

13      that he understands the intent, chaps, but, Al, if you really

14      think only the second release is GA, then you had better start

15      using that terminology internally, an alternative terminology

16      for the first release, or we'll be in a sticky wicket.

17             Did I read that correctly?

18      A      Can you go down to the email he's responding to me on?

19      Because I didn't quite see that.           I -- and I meant this email

20      is from four years ago, so I just want to make sure I -- I'm

21      understanding correct --

22                     MR. DACUS:   Can scroll down, Mr. Lodge?

23      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) The email below, sir, if you look at your

24      response at the bottom, it says:           Our current plans have the GA

25      date for release 1.0 as September 2012, correct?
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 106 of 129 PageID #: 61391
                                                                                 106



1      A      That's correct.

2      Q      Those are your words --

3      A      They are.

4      Q      -- correct?

5             And then --

6      A      This is written before that date, of course.

7      Q      And that's Mr. Reekie telling you:           We've got big problems

8      if this is GA because we've not paid Mr. Smith the $450,000,

9      correct?

10      A      So what I'm saying there is that our current plans have

11      the first release of the software being completed at

12      September 31st, 2012.

13             At that time, there are a load more features that were

14      becoming -- it was becoming clear that we needed before

15      customers would buy the -- buy the software.              So we were

16      planning to put those into the release that we called

17      release 2.0.

18             And what I was saying to Mr. Reekie, given that no

19      customer is going to want to buy the level of software that

20      we've got at release 1.0, then there actually -- if we didn't

21      need to declare the product was GA, then it would be perfectly

22      reasonable for us not to because no customer would want to buy

23      it at -- at that point in September.

24      Q      But we know Mr. Lazar reported to the board of directors

25      that it was, in fact, GA, correct?

                                                                                 107



1      A      Yes.     I think that was an error.

2      Q      And we also note that Metaswitch, to this day, has never

3      paid New Class Five the $450,000, correct?

4      A      That is correct.

5      Q      Now, with respect to the LFA product --

6                     MR. DACUS:   We can pull that down, Mr. Lodge.

7      Q      (By Mr. Dacus) -- did I understand you to say that there

8      were trials done at specific customers?

9      A      There was a trial done at one customer.

10      Q      Is that Windstream?

11      A      That is Windstream.

12      Q      Was there a trial done at a -- at a customer by the name

13      of Range?

14      A      I forget.     It's possible.

15      Q      Okay.

16      A      We may have discussed it, certainly.

17      Q      And you -- Metaswitch made offers to run trials of its LFA

18      product that included the '273 patent at CenturyLink and also

19      at a place called Swiftel, correct?

20      A      That's quite probable.

21      Q      Quite probable?

22      A      Yes.

23      Q      And is it true that those customers at some point came to

24      you and actually wanted to purchase the line frame adaptor, but

25      there simply was not enough volume to make it profitable to

                                                                                 108



1      Metaswitch?

2      A      It wasn't a question of volume at that time.             We didn't

3      have a completed product for them to purchase.

4      Q      You've been out at their place running a trial with your

5      product, though, correct?

6      A      Well, when you produce a brand new product for the field,

7      it's really important to see actually whether or not what

8      you've produced does the right sort of functionality.                And it

9      was actually in the course of some of those early prototype

10      trials that we realized quite how much extra work we had to do.

11      Q      Is it true, sir, that in December of 2013, Metaswitch

12      decided to suspend or to -- or stop development of this New

13      Class Five line frame adaptor?

14      A      That is correct.

15      Q      So at that point, Metaswitch said:           We're not going to

16      make this product anymore or even attempt to make it, correct?

17      A      We paused development on it and, you know, pending

18      finding, as I said earlier, a customer who would be willing to

19      pay us to take the product to the final development phase where

20      they would be prepared to deploy it.

21      Q      Right.

22             And Metaswitch, like most big companies, sir, they -- they

23      create financial statements, correct?

24      A      That is correct.

25      Q      And Metaswitch has something a little unusual in that it

                                                                                 109



1      has an August 31st year-end, true?

2      A      That is true.

3      Q      Rather than a December year-end, the year-end is August?

4      A      Don't ask me why.

5      Q      I won't.    But it is true, correct?

6      A      It is true.

7      Q      And so for 2014, Metaswitch had its annual financial

8      statements, correct?

9      A      That is correct.

10      Q      And since December of 2013 is when you stopped the

11      product, that was actually included in the 2014 financial

12      statements, isn't that fair?

13      A      Yes, that's right.

14      Q      And as -- as a result of terminating or suspending the

15      product, what Metaswitch did is it followed proper accounting

16      procedures and wrote off the value of that New Class Five

17      investment, fair?

18      A      I'll take your word for it.

19      Q      You certainly don't dispute that, do you?

20      A      I don't, no.

21      Q      And that makes sense, doesn't it?           I mean, you're no

22      longer pursuing the investment, so you would write off the

23      amount of the investment, correct?

24      A      It's the sort of thing that Chief Financial Officers do,

25      yes.

1      Q      Okay.   And that happened on August 31st of 2014, correct?

2      A      That sounds correct.

3      Q      Okay.   But in July of 2014, you actually filed this

4      lawsuit here in Marshall, Texas, correct?

5      A      That is correct.

6      Q      So in the financial statements, which, by the way, the

7      management of the company swears to the truth of these

8      financial statements, correct?

9      A      Correct.

10      Q      So in the financial statements in England, you're

11      representing to the public, and I assume to all the

12      authorities, that the value of the New Class Five investment

13      has been written off, correct?

14      A      Correct.

15      Q      Yet at the same time, you come 5,000 miles across the

16      Atlantic ocean to Marshall, Texas, and you represent to this

17      jury that the value of the New Class Five investment, including

18      the '273 patent, is $38 million, true?

19      A      Well, of course, we now know precisely how much money

20      Genband has made from the use of that patent which helps us to

21      understand that it was worth rather a lot more.

22      Q      So the truth is, sir, you came here, correct?

23      A      Are we talking now or in 2014?

24      Q      In 2014, July.

1      2014, yes.

2      Q      And filed a lawsuit, correct?

3      A      Correct.

4      Q      Asking for $38 million, correct?

5      A      I don't know exactly when the damages agreements came out

6      and exactly what damages we asked for when.              I'm -- I'm not an

7      attorney.

8      Q      That's what you're asking the jury for now, correct, sir?

9      A      That is correct, yes.

10      Q      Thank you.

11                   MR. DACUS:     I pass the witness, Your Honor.

15      BY MR. MANN:

16      Q      Mr. Mitchell, you remember in direct I asked you -- or you

17      mentioned the attempted merger by Genband?

18      A      I remember that.

19      Q      And in the attempted merger by Genband, that included this

20      '273 patent?

21      A      It did include that, yes.

22      Q      And the '273 patent that we were discussing through all

23      that detail is a patent that Metaswitch still owns?

24      A      We still own that patent.

25      Q      Never licensed it to Genband?

1      A      Never licensed it to Genband.

2      Q      Never offered it to Genband?

3      A      No.

4      Q      And yet your position is -- as a chief engineer, senior

5      engineer of Metaswitch, is that -- what are they doing with the

6      '273 patent?

7      A      They are using it.

8      Q      Thank you, sir.

9                     MR. MANN:    Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.        One further

10      question.

11      Q      (By Mr. Mann) The -- the '273 patent that we're talking

12      about was never -- was it ever commercialized?

13      A      No.

14      Q      Ever sold to anybody?

15      A      No.

16      Q      Only prototyped?

17      A      Correct.

18      Q      Okay.     And any compensation between the parties on selling

19      anything related to the '273 patent?

20      A      Other than when we purchased it from New Class Five, no.

21      Q      Thank you.

22                     MR. MANN:    That's all I have.      Thank you.     Pass the

23      witness.

1                                  RECROSS-EXAMINATION

2      BY MR. DACUS:

3      Q      With respect to the '273 patent, Mr. Mitchell, at the time

4      that your deposition was taken in this case, you had not even

5      reviewed or read the '273 patent, had you, sir?

6      A      No, I hadn't.

7      Q      So at the time the lawsuit was filed, you had not even

8      read the '273 patent, correct?

9      A      That is correct.

10      Q      So you had no idea Genband was using it at the time that

11      you filed this lawsuit or not, correct?

12      A      I'm not the legal expert on these matters, but, no, at

13      that time, I -- I had not read the patent.

14      Q      But you are the Senior Vice President of Engineering at

15      Metaswitch, correct?

16      A      I am, yes.

17                   MR. DACUS:     I have nothing further, Your Honor.           Pass

18      the witness.

19                   THE COURT:     Redirect?

20                   MR. MANN:     No, Your Honor.      We pass the witness.

21                   THE COURT:      All right.     You may step down,

22      Mr. Mitchell.

10                                   DIRECT EXAMINATION

11      BY MR. HOLMES:

12      Q      Good morning, Mr. Thomas.         Would you please introduce

13      yourself to the jury?

14      A      Hi.   I'm Pete Thomas.        I grew up here in Texas.       I

15      actually was born in Hillsboro, and my father was a Southern

16      Baptist minster, so we moved quite a bit and moved to Ft. Worth

17      and eventually graduated Denton High School.              That's where I

18      lived for about 12 years.

19             And for the last -- I don't know -- 18 years, I've lived

20      in McKinney, Texas.

21                   THE COURT:     Would you speak up a little bit,

22      Mr. Thomas, or pull the microphone a little closer?

23                   THE WITNESS:     Yes.

24                   THE COURT:     All right.     Let's continue.

25      Q      (By Mr. Holmes) Mr. Thomas, would you please tell us about
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 115 of 129 PageID #: 61400
                                                                                 115



1      your family?

2      A       Yes.     I've been married 22 years tomorrow, so it's -- it's

3      a long time.       And I have two children.        My daughter is 21, and

4      my son, Devon, is 19.        And they're -- both moved out of the

5      house about six months ago.

6      Q       Mr. Thomas, did you attend college?

7      A       Yes, I did.     I went to the University of North Texas in

8      Denton and also got a master's degree at SMU in

9      telecommunications.

10      Q       And where do you currently work?

11      A       I currently work at Sedona Systems.

12      Q       And prior to working at Sedona Systems, where did you

13      work?

14      A       I worked at Metaswitch Networks for over eight years.

15      Q       When did you leave Metaswitch Networks?

16      A       In October of last year.

17      Q       And, Mr. Thomas, would you please explain to the jury why

18      you left?

19      A       Yeah.    So, as I said, I'm an empty nester, my wife and I.

20      And so with over eight years, I got recruited by a -- by

21      Sedona.        And it's a technology company that is in a different

22      area of the network.        And so I talked to my wife, and we made a

23      decision to take a risk at this point in our life, and that's

24      why I chose to leave.

25      Q       Now, Mr. Thomas, you're no longer employed at Metaswitch,
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 116 of 129 PageID #: 61401
                                                                                 116



1      so would you please tell us why you're here today?

2      A       Yeah.     I was contacted by my former boss, Mr. Bruce Henry.

3      He -- he contacted me and asked -- said I would have helpful

4      information for the jury, would I be willing to assist in this

5      case, and -- and I agreed.

6      Q       Mr. Thomas, do you have any financial interest in this

7      case?

8      A       No, I do not.     I was with Metaswitch for eight years, and

9      I do have some shares with the company, but no financial

10      interest in this case.

11      Q       And are you being compensated by Metaswitch for your

12      testimony here today?

13      A       No, I'm not.

14      Q       Mr. Thomas, would you please tell the jury why you joined

15      Metaswitch eight years ago?

16      A       Yeah.     2007, I had a past colleague, Steve Barnum, who I

17      really -- we got along really well, and I trusted him, and he

18      said there's a very challenging role.            I -- I admired

19      Metaswitch's technology and -- from seeing them, you know, in

20      the industry, and so I thought it would be a great challenge.

21      Q       And what did you do at Metaswitch?

22      A       I was in sales.     I was a customer-facing person to the

23      company.        I was the representative -- the customer advocate,

24      and -- and to -- for Metaswitch, so basically I started out as

25      sales director to medium-sized service providers,
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 117 of 129 PageID #: 61402
                                                                                 117



1      telecommunication providers, and in the process of eight years,

2      I was promoted three times.

3      Q      And what was your title when you left Metaswitch?

4      A      I was the Senior Vice President of Sales for North

5      America.

6      Q      And can you give the jury some context?            How close were

7      you to the CEO?

8      A      Yeah.   I was two levels down from the CEO, so the CEO and

9      I talked quite frequently.

10      Q      Now, during your eight years at Metaswitch, who were your

11      customers?

12      A      So the -- the customers that I started out with were

13      mid-tier customers.        We put them in three tiers, basically.

14             The Tier 1 would be customers that are large multinational

15      service providers, cable companies, such as AT&T.

16             Then there's a Tier 2, which I focused on initially, and

17      those are medium-sized customers, telephone customers basically

18      that span multiple states.         And that would be like Windstream

19      and those type of customers.

20             And then there's the smaller providers that service small

21      cities, rural areas, and they're called Tier 3.

22      Q      Now, of those three tiers, is there a particular tier that

23      Metaswitch focused its sales on?

24      A      Yeah.   Prior to my starting, we -- Metaswitch had a lot of

25      focus on Tier 3, the smaller service providers.               They -- the
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 118 of 129 PageID #: 61403
                                                                                 118



1      other competitors were pulling out of that space, not focusing

2      on it, going after the larger providers, so Metaswitch saw a

3      market.     And it actually turned out to be a very good

4      opportunity for us.        There was over 400 customers that went

5      with us.

6      Q      Would you consider that strategy to have been successful?

7      A      It was extremely successful.         I mean, the customers that

8      are in the small rural market, they need -- they need to trust

9      someone.       It's a big decision for them to change a voice switch

10      to go over Voice over IP or Voice over Internet.               And so with

11      our strong support and great technology, it was a -- it was a

12      great move for us.

13      Q      Mr. Thomas, do you know Alastair Mitchell?

14      A      I do know Mr. Mitchell.        I've worked with him for eight

15      years.     We kind of grew up in -- in Metaswitch together, and --

16      and so I -- I worked with him extensively while I was at

17      Metaswitch.

18      Q      And did Mr. Mitchell oversee the Metaswitch products that

19      you were selling?

20      A      Yes, he did.     He -- he, you know, focused on the products,

21      and so we worked heavily because I was involved with customer

22      sales.

23      Q      And what types of products did you sell?

24      A      Yeah.     So we sold Voice over IP or Voice over the

25      Internet, so basically transforming the other -- the -- the
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 119 of 129 PageID #: 61404
                                                                                 119



1      legacy voice to be able to do new applications as everybody has

2      Internet in their house or Internet to businesses.

3      Q      And can you please give the jury some examples of the

4      products that you sold?

5      A      Yeah.   So we sold Call Feature Server, media gateways,

6      session border controllers, Metasphere application server.                     All

7      these -- all these services are used for enhanced Voice over

8      the Internet.

9      Q      And what is -- can you please elaborate?            What is enhanced

10      Voice over the Internet services?

11      A      Yeah.   So it could provide -- say you have high definition

12      TV, you can do high definition voice where it sounds crystal

13      clear.    You can do applications within a business to -- to

14      automate some of the voice personnel.            And so it was just a lot

15      of different applications and unifying everything on to -- on

16      to the Internet backbone.

17      Q      Now, did Metaswitch have any competition for sales of its

18      products?

19      A      Yeah.   We had competitors in various product lines.

20      Q      And who were some of Metaswitch's competitors?

21      A      Yeah.   So we were kind of the smaller company, and we were

22      competing with mainly larger companies, such as Genband or

23      Alcatel-Lucent, and to a lesser extent, maybe Sonus Networks.

24      Q      And was Genband always a competitor of Metaswitch?

25      A      Not necessarily.      When I first started in 2007, they
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 120 of 129 PageID #: 61405
                                                                                 120



1      weren't that big of a competitor, but in the last four to five

2      years, they've been our predominant competitor.

3      Q      How often would you say you were competing with Genband in

4      the marketplace?

5      A      I would say most opportunities that we focused on, we were

6      competing with Genband, and over 75 percent, I would say.

7      Q      And did Genband ever win a sale over Metaswitch?

8      A      Oh, yes, they did.

9      Q      Could you give us an example of one of those?

10      A      Example would be Frontier Communications.             They're kind of

11      a northeast provider.        I tended Tier 2, as I stated before.

12      They were looking at a large transformation opportunity, and we

13      were competing against Genband and -- and we lost that.

14      Q      And how long was that sales process?

15      A      Yeah.   We were selling a phone switch.           It's -- it's a

16      long sales cycle, because that's the heart of the business.                    So

17      the key part is you've got to convince multiple groups --

18      especially when you're a smaller company like ourselves, you

19      have to even go further to convince various parts of the

20      business that you can support them, your technology is solid,

21      and -- and you can be a partner with them.              And so it's about

22      18 to 24 months as a sales cycle.

23      Q      And so would you please tell the jury what happened in the

24      Frontier sale that you lost?

25      A      My understanding is that we lost due to Genband having a
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 121 of 129 PageID #: 61406
                                                                                 121



1      lower price.

2      Q      And do you know what products Frontier purchased from

3      Genband?

4      A      Yes.   My understanding, it was a C20 and then the G6 Media

5      Gateway, maybe five or six of those gateways.

6      Q      And what products was Metaswitch trying to sell to

7      Frontier?

8      A      Our products were the Call Feature Server and the Media

9      Gateways.     Also, to -- to transform and do transformation, you

10      also got to migrate these customers, and so we had services to

11      migrate them and maintenance to support the switch.

12      Q      And do you know what the value to Metaswitch was if they

13      had won that Frontier deal?

14      A      It was approximately $2 million, so quite significant for

15      the size of company that Metaswitch is.

16      Q      And -- and how do you come up with that valuation?

17      A      Yes.   So of the 2 million, it's about approximately

18      one-and-a-half million was product sales of the gateway and the

19      Call Feature Server, and the remaining 500,000 were services --

20      professional service migration and so forth.

21             And then in addition, the key to those kind of sales takes

22      two years to do it, and then you've got the follow-on sales.

23      So each year they grow the product.            You get product sales

24      there.     You got maintenance for that.         And you got services

25      associated with it.

1      Q      Thank you, Mr. Thomas.

2                     MR. HOLMES:   We pass the witness.

3                     THE COURT:    Cross-examination by the Defendants?

4                     MR. DACUS:    Thank you, Your Honor.

5                                   CROSS-EXAMINATION

6      BY MR. DACUS:

7      Q      Good morning, Mr. Thomas.

8      A      Good morning.

9      Q      Did I understand you to tell the jury that you have no

10      financial interest in this lawsuit?

11      A      No, I don't have financial interest.

12      Q      Okay.     You do own some shares of Metaswitch, correct?

13      A      Yes.     As I stated, I do have shares in Metaswitch.

14      Q      Yeah.     Those are owned in the Employee Benefit Trust,

15      correct?

16      A      That is not correct.

17      Q      What -- how do you own them?         Just individually?

18      A      You know, so when I chose -- one of the decision factors

19      when I chose to leave Metaswitch, I had 200,000 shares, and I

20      chose to leave 170,000 shares outside.             So I have about 28,000

21      shares approximately.

22      Q      So if the value of Metaswitch goes up as a result of money

23      obtained from this lawsuit, you make more money because you

24      have shares, correct?

25      A      I do have shares, and I guess indirectly that would be
Case 2:14-cv-00033-JRG Document 523 Filed 03/20/16 Page 123 of 129 PageID #: 61408
                                                                                 123



1      true.

2      Q       It's not indirectly.      For every dollar of increase in

3      Metaswitch, you get $28,000 in your pocket based on the fact

4      you have 28,000 shares, correct?

5      A       That's correct.

6      Q       Okay.   So can we agree you do have a financial interest?

7      A       I guess, if you put it that way, yes.

8      Q       Okay.   Now, it is true, sir, that you had some involvement

9      with Metaswitch's development of this line frame adaptor based

10      on the New Class Five acquisition, correct?

11      A       I did not have any involvement in the development.

12      Q       And I -- I misspoke, and I apologize.

13              You -- you were involved in trying to sell the product,

14      correct?

15      A       I -- I was involved in gaging customers on the technology.

16      Q       Gaging customers means you were going to customers and

17      asking them if they wanted to purchase the line frame adaptor,

18      correct?

19      A       That's not correct.

20      Q       Did you make pitches to the customers?

21      A       We engaged customers to see about the demand.             It wasn't a

22      product to sell, so we couldn't actually try to sell it to

23      them.

24      Q       Did you go to customers and offer to do a trial for the

25      customer of the line frame adaptor product?

1      A       We did a concept trial, yes.

2      Q       Okay.   In fact, you did more than one of those, correct?

3      A       Not -- no.    Only one that I'm aware of.

4      Q       Only -- the Windstream is the only one you're aware of?

5      A       Windstream.

6      Q       Okay.   Now, you were around when Metaswitch was

7      contemplating buying New Class Five, fair?

8      A       Yes.

9      Q       Okay.   You remember participating in some discussions with

10      Metaswitch employees about whether or not to buy the New Class

11      Five assets?

12      A       I was involved in the strategic decision whether to buy

13      them.

14      Q       My question, sir, was:       Do you remember having discussions

15      about whether or not to buy them, not whether you -- not -- you

16      made the strategic decision?

17      A       I was involved in some discussions, yes.

18      Q       Do you know a man named Stefan Knight?

19      A       Yes.

20      Q       He's a Metaswitch employee, correct?

21      A       That's correct -- well, no, he was a Metaswitch employee.

22      No.

23      Q       He's no longer there?

24      A       That's correct.

25      Q       He was there in April of 2011, correct?

1      A       I believe so.

2      Q       And that's a time when Metaswitch was contemplating this

3      New Class Five purchase and whether or not to buy those assets,

4      true?

5      A       That's correct.

6      Q       And do you remember that Mr. Knight, in a discussion with

7      you, told you that Genband does not need the New Class Five

8      assets?

9      A       I don't recall that.

10      Q       Okay.

11                      MR. DACUS:   Can I have the document camera, please,

12      Ms. Lockhart?

13      Q       (By Mr. Dacus) Let me show you, sir, an email dated

14      April 16th of 2011 from Stefan Knight.

15              Do you see that?

16      A       Yes.

17      Q       And do you see you're one of the recipients of that email?

18      A       Yes.

19      Q       And do you see that he says he's providing fresh thoughts

20      on the partnering position here, and he's referring to

21      potentially partnering or buying the New Class Five assets,

22      correct?

23      A       Correct.

24      Q       And he basically says that it's important for Metaswitch

25      to do it because they can offer opportunities to New Class Five

1      through access to these Tier 2 and 3 carriers, correct?

2      A      Yes.

3      Q      But then he says Genband does not need the New Class Five

4      assets, correct?

5      A      Yes.

6                    MR. DACUS:    That's all I have, Your Honor.          I pass

7      the witness.

8                    THE COURT:    All right.     Redirect, Mr. Holmes?

9                                 REDIRECT EXAMINATION

10      BY MR. HOLMES:

11      Q      Mr. Thomas, you were asked some questions about a line

12      frame adaptor.

13             Do you remember that?

14      A      Yes.

15      Q      And can you just briefly remind the jury, what is a line

16      frame adaptor?

17      A      A line frame adaptor is some technology that allows

18      service providers to transform from a legacy, say 1970s

19      technology, to the current technology to do Voice over IP.

20      Q      Now, where did Metaswitch get the technology to try and

21      develop a line frame adaptor?

22      A      Through the acquisition -- I'm sorry -- through the

23      acquisition of NC 5.

24      Q      And did Metaswitch ever sell a line frame adaptor?

25      A      No.    We never did.

1      Q       Did it ever make an offer to sell a line frame adaptor?

2      A       No.

3      Q       And did Metaswitch ever market that it could sell a line

4      frame adaptor publicly?

5      A       No, it did not.

6      Q       And, Mr. Thomas, are -- are you a lawyer?

7      A       No.

8      Q       And, Mr. Thomas, have you ever read the '273 patent?

9      A       No, I have not.

10                    MR. HOLMES:    No further questions.

11                    THE COURT:    Further cross?

12                    MR. DACUS:    Nothing further, Your Honor.          Thank you.

13                    THE COURT:    All right.     Mr. Thomas, you may step

14      down.

15                    Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to use this

16      opportunity to break for lunch.           For various reasons, we got

17      off to a little bit of a slow start today, so I've asked

18      Ms. Martin, the clerk, to provide lunch for the jury so that we

19      can take a shorter lunch break than we would otherwise and

20      perhaps make up a little time.

21                    I'm going to ask you to be back -- or in the jury

22      room ready to come back about 20 minutes until 1:00.                Lunch

23      should be in the jury room when you get there.               I hope you

24      enjoy it.

25                    Don't discuss the case among yourselves.            Take your

1      juror book -- notebooks with you into the lunch -- into the

2      jury room for lunch.

3                   And with those instructions, ladies and gentlemen of

4      the jury, you are excused for lunch.

5                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise for the jury.

6                   (Jury out.)

7                   THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

8                   Plaintiff, do I understand your next witness is

9      Dr. Burger?      Is that correct?

10                   MR. VERHOEVEN:      Dr. Burger, yes, Your Honor.

11                   THE COURT:      All right.     Counsel, if you'll be

12      available about 12:30, I'll try to meet with you on the

13      remaining objections to demonstratives that will be raised with

14      Dr. Burger, and we'll plan to start back about 20 minutes until

15      1:00.

16                   Mr. Mann?

17                   MR. MANN:     Could we excuse Mr. Thomas if there is no

18      objection?

19                   THE COURT:     Is there any objection?

20                   MR. DACUS:     There is not, Your Honor.

21                   THE COURT:     Mr. Thomas is excused.

22                   We stand in recess for lunch.

23                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.
