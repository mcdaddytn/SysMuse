11:56:30   17   Q.   You didn't look into them, right?       You didn't search

11:56:33   18   for patent numbers.       You didn't search for Li Creative

11:56:37   19   Technologies at the Patent Office.        You just didn't

11:56:38   20   investigate; is that right?

11:56:39   21   A.   Our policy has always been that we don't investigate

11:56:51   22   patents, we don't search for patents, we don't look for

11:56:54   23   patents, we don't discuss other people's patents.

11:56:59   24            As engineers at Amazon, our job is to develop

11:57:07   25   technology, invent things, develop products, features.            And

11:57:16    1   it's up to our patent attorneys to see what's patentable

11:57:23    2   and what's protectable, and that's their job.

11:57:26    3           Our job is to invent, develop, and not really to

11:57:31    4   try to judge what's -- what's patentable and what's not.

11:57:35    5           (Videoclip ends.)

11:57:41    6           THE COURT:     Does that complete this witness by

11:57:44    7   deposition?

11:57:44    8           MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:      Yes, Your Honor.

11:57:45    9           THE COURT:     All right.     Ladies and gentlemen,

11:57:46   10   we're right at the noon hour.       We're going to use this

11:57:50   11   opportunity to break for lunch.       I'm told by the clerk's

11:57:53   12   office your lunch is awaiting you in the jury room.

11:57:57   13           If you will simply close your notebooks but please

11:58:01   14   take them with you over the lunch break.         Please follow all

11:58:03   15   the instructions I've given you about your conduct,

11:58:05   16   including not to discuss the case among yourselves, and

11:58:08   17   we'll be back to continue with the next Plaintiff's witness

11:58:11   18   immediately after lunch.

11:58:12   19           I would hope to reconvene about 12:45.

11:58:18   20           With that, the jury is excused for lunch.

11:58:21   21           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

11:58:22   22           (Jury out.)

11:58:22   23           THE COURT:     We stand in recess for lunch.

           24           (Recess.)
