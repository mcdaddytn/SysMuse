Percentage Entry Mode

We need to fix the percentage entry spin control.  Currently when timesheet is in the mode of percentage time entry, the spin controls do not work correctly.  It appears that two spin controls become visible and are overlapping in a way that prevents the percent entry from working.  There is one control that allows integer entry and spin up or down in values, but those values are not recorded or reflected in the total.  There is another spin control (that seems to appear behind or underneath with the spin portion of the control at the right of the other control.  This one seems to affect the values in the total when spun up or down, but is disassociated from the control where the user can enter text.  This needs to be cleaned up so only one control is visible and allows both text entry and spin up and down to enter integer percent value.
