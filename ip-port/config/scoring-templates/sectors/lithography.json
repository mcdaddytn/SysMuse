  "contextDescription": "Lithography patents cover the critical patterning step in semiconductor manufacturing. Key areas include photoresist chemistry, exposure systems (DUV, EUV), mask technology, and computational lithography. High-value targets include ASML (sole EUV vendor), photoresist suppliers (JSR, TOK, Shin-Etsu), and foundries. Lithography is the bottleneck for advanced nodes.",
  "scoringGuidance": [
    "EUV-related patents are extremely high value given ASML's monopoly.",
    "Photoresist chemistry patents target specialized chemical suppliers.",
    "Computational lithography patents (OPC, ILT) target EDA vendors.",
    "Mask/reticle patents apply to all advanced semiconductor manufacturing.",
    "Multi-patterning patents are essential for nodes below 10nm."
