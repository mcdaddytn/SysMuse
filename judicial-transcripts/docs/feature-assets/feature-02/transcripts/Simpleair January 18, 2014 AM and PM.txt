11                 (Jury out.)

12                 COURT SECURITY OFFICER:    All rise.

13                 THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

14                 All right.     Counsel, we've gotten another

15     note from the jury.   And I'll ask, is this 4 -- is that

16     the right one?

17                 COURTROOM DEPUTY:    5.

18                 THE COURT:     5, fifth note.   I'll mark it as

19     5 for identification.

20                 I'm going to read it, and then I'm going to

21     want a response from both parties from the podium

22     starting with the Plaintiff, and then I want to hear

23     from the Defendant on this.

24                 Here's the note:     When damages are awarded,

25     does Google also receive the licensure to use the patent

1      in the future?

2                    That's the question.      Signed by the jury

3      foreperson.

4                    Mr. Dovel, what's the -- what's the

5      Plaintiff's position --

6                    MR. DOVEL:   May I have just one moment, Your

7      Honor?

8                    THE COURT:   -- as to a proper response?

9                    MR. DOVEL:   Your Honor, I believe the

10     response we would propose is to refer the jury to the

11     jury instructions and to instruct them something to the

12     effect that they're not to consider future damages.          The

13     damages are through the -- the -- through the date of

14     the trial, something to that effect.

15                   THE COURT:   So, in essence, you're

16     suggesting that the answer be no?

17                   MR. DOVEL:   Yes, that's right.

18                   THE COURT:   All right.    Mr. Stockwell,

19     what's the Defendant's response as to an appropriate

20     response to give to the jury?

21                   MR. STOCKWELL:   Unfortunately, Your Honor,

22     our answer would be, yes, that the damages awarded would

23     be for the life of the patent, and, Your Honor, there

24     was clearly a dispute between Mr. Mills and Dr. Ugone

25     over this.
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 623 Filed 01/23/14 Page 5 of 27 PageID #: 17407

1                  Mr. Mills testified to a running royalty,

2      and his lump sum was the present value through 2013.

3      Dr. Ugone testified that the form of the damages awarded

4      would be a lump sum fully paid-up amount.

5                  This is why we asked the Court to tender on

6      the verdict form and submit to the issue -- issue --

7      submit to the jury the issue of what the form of the

8      payment would be.   Under Rule 49, you know, we have a

9      special verdict form, there's a dispute in the evidence.

10     We believe that the appropriate thing to do was to ask

11     the jury to decide whether their damages award was for

12     the life of the patent or through 2013.

13                 THE COURT:   Well, I'll remind you that

14     during the formal jury charge, the Defendant lodged no

15     objection to the verdict form.

16                 MR. STOCKWELL:   Your Honor --

17                 THE COURT:   We did have a discussion

18     informally before the formal jury charge.

19                 MR. STOCKWELL:   I'm sorry?

20                 THE COURT:   Before the formal charge

21     conference, we did have a discussion informally, but

22     when the verdict was taken up in the formal charge

23     conference, neither side lodged any objection to the

24     verdict.

25                 MR. STOCKWELL:   Your Honor, you might recall

1      that --

2                  THE COURT:   At least that's my recollection.

3                  MR. STOCKWELL:   Your Honor, that -- that was

4      true initially, but you might recall you came back in

5      and Ms. Williams went through the verdict form to lodge

6      the objection to not having the lump sum payment

7      question asked on the verdict form.

8                  THE COURT:   Well, nonetheless, they have the

9      verdict form in their hands and --

10                 MR. STOCKWELL:   Yes, sir, I -- I understand

11     that, Your Honor.

12                 In any event, we -- we wanted to tender that

13     issue to the jury for exactly this reason.   There --

14     there's a debate amongst the parties' experts as to, you

15     know, what the damages period is.

16                 THE COURT:   All right.   Given -- given --

17     given that, let me poll both sides as to their response

18     to the possibility of the Court replying to this note by

19     telling the jury that they should award an amount of

20     money and indicate clearly that it is either with or

21     without a future license and let them make the decision

22     and take that into account when they calculate the

23     numerical amount that would join with it.    X dollars

24     without a future license; X dollars with a future

25     license.

1                    What's your response to that idea?

2                    MR. STOCKWELL:   I have no problem with that

3      idea, Your Honor.   That's the issue that we wanted to

4      tender.

5                    THE COURT:   How does the Plaintiff feel

6      about that?

7                    MR. DOVEL:   Your Honor, I don't have legal

8      authority -- authority to cite right now, but I believe

9      that legally what the jury can award is up to today.

10     They -- unless the parties were to somehow agree that,

11     you know, if we're going to go beyond the bounds of the

12     law and ask them to award a future license amount.

13     And I -- I don't think that would be appropriate, Your

14     Honor.    I'm concerned about creating some kind of issue

15     here.

16                   THE COURT:   Well --

17                   MR. DOVEL:   The fact that Mr. -- that

18     Dr. Ugone presented this evidence doesn't mean that it's

19     legally relevant, and the parties have all kinds of

20     different disputes about what's going to wind up in the

21     jury instructions and so on, so it presents that

22     evidence.    It doesn't mean that under the law that

23     that's the appropriate way to go.

24                   THE COURT:   I'll be honest, counsel, my

25     recollection of the evidence is that no one talked about

1      future infringement and that needing to be taken into

2      account.   The infringement expert didn't, the damages

3      expert didn't, except to the extent that perhaps

4      Dr. Ugone coached -- couched his in -- in the way that

5      Mr. Stockwell represents.

6                  But this trial has been about infringement

7      up through today, not anywhere along the line was there

8      a clear indication to the jury that this was going to

9      cover whatever might happen in the future.   They've not

10     been told how long the life of the patent is.   They

11     don't know when it expires.   If they're supposed to

12     calculate what future damages are, they don't even have

13     an out -- an end date in the future to calculate

14     through.   So that's part -- that's a large part of why

15     the verdict is written the way it is and a large part of

16     why the Court did what it did with the charge and the

17     verdict.

18                 I'm just trying to see if there can be some

19     consensus between the parties that within -- ensure this

20     is not a future issue.   If there's not consensus between

21     the parties, then I'll make my best choice and I'll

22     respond to the jury appropriately.   But certainly if

23     both sides could agree to let the jury award it either

24     way, I think that would take the issue off the table.

25     If both parties can't agree to do that, then they can't

1      agree to do that.

2                    MR. DOVEL:   Can I consult with counsel?

3                    THE COURT:   Certain -- certainly.     This

4      is -- this is not something we're under any time

5      constraints on.

6                    Let's go off the record.

7                        (Off-the-record discussion.)

8                    THE COURT:   Let's go back on the record a

9      minute.

10                   Counsel, let me see you in chambers, and

11     we'll discuss this informally in chambers.

12                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:    All rise.

13                   (Recess.)

14                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:    All rise.

15                   THE COURT:   Be seated, please.

16                   All right.   I've heard from the parties on

17     the record.    We've had an informal discussion in

18     chambers.     Let me now hear, in light of all that, from

19     both Plaintiff and Defendant as to what their proposed

20     response to the question from the jury is, being, again,

21     when damages are awarded, does Google also receive the

22     licensure to use the patent in the future.

23                   Mr. Dovel?

24                   MR. DOVEL:   Your Honor, the Plaintiff would

25     propose that the jury be told that the answer to that

1      question is, no, and that they should -- that Plaintiff

2      is only seeking damages through the time of trial.

3                    THE COURT:   Mr. Stockwell?

4                    MR. STOCKWELL:   Your Honor, we propose --

5      we -- we object to that, and we propose that we -- and

6      renew our request to have the jury determine whether the

7      damages awarded are in the form of a lump sum, fully

8      paid-up license, or a running royalty through trial,

9      Your Honor.

10                   THE COURT:   All right.   Well, this is the

11     response the Court intends to send to the jury.

12                   Members of the jury, in response to your

13     fifth note, if you have found that the Defendant has

14     infringed one or more of the asserted claims of the '914

15     patent and that the claims are not invalid, you should

16     award money damages for Defendant's infringement through

17     the date of this trial.

18                   Plaintiff care to make any objection to that

19     response?

20                   MR. DOVEL:   No objection from the Plaintiff.

21                   THE COURT:   Defendant care to make an

22     objection?

23                   MR. STOCKWELL:   Only objections as stated

24     earlier, Your Honor.

25                   THE COURT:   All right.   Thank you, counsel.

1                   I'm going to direct the courtroom deputy to

2      deliver this response to the Court Security Officer, who

3      is obviously with the jury and not in the courtroom, and

4      have the CSO take it into the members of the jury.

5                   With that, we return to being in recess.

6                   And I'll also hand the fifth note from the

7      jury to the courtroom deputy to be made a part of the

8      trial.

9                   We're in recess.

10                  (Recess.)

11                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   All rise.

12                  THE COURT:   Be seated, please.

13                  All right.   Counsel, we've gotten a sixth

14     note from the jury.   I'll mark it as No. 6, and after I

15     read it, I'll hand it to the courtroom deputy.

16                  The note reads as follows:   If the jury

17     cannot reach a unanimous decision, what options do we

18     have?    Signed by Joyce Foster, jury foreperson.

19                  Here is the Court's proposed response.     I'm

20     going to read it, and then I'll hear objections, if any,

21     from the parties.

22                  Members of the jury, in response to your

23     sixth note, please continue your deliberations to reach

24     a verdict.   Please also consider the following comments:

25     This is an important case, the trial has been expensive
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 623 Filed 01/23/14 Page 12 of 27 PageID #: 17414



11  



1      in terms of time, effort, money and emotional strain to

2      both the Plaintiff and the Defendant.     If you fail to

3      agree on a verdict, the case remains open and may have

4      to be tried again.    A second trial would be costly to

5      both sides, and there's no reason to believe either side

6      can try it again better or more exhaustively than they

7      have tried it before you.      You shouldn't hesitate to

8      re-examine your own views and change your opinions if

9      you become convinced it's wrong.     To bring your minds to

10     a unanimous result, you must openly and frankly examine

11     the questions submitted to you with proper regard for

12     the opinions of others and with a willingness to

13     re-examine your own views.      I remind you that in your

14     deliberations, you are to consider the Court's

15     instructions as a whole, you shouldn't single out any

16     part of the instructions, including this one, and ignore

17     others.

18                   Is there objection or -- is there objection

19     from the Plaintiff?

20                   MR. DOVEL:   No objection from the Plaintiff,

21     Your Honor.

22                   THE COURT:   Is there objection from the

23     Defendant?

24                   MR. STOCKWELL:    Yes, Your Honor, I have

25     several objections.    At this point, Google would make a

1      motion for a mistrial.    We believe the Court should

2      order a new trial given the length of deliberations,

3      nine hours, the number of jury notes, and the fact that

4      this jury cannot reach a unanimous verdict on damages.

5      We do not think an Allen charge would be appropriate in

6      this situation given this record, Your Honor.

7                   THE COURT:   That objection is overruled.    Do

8      you have anything else, counsel?

9                   MR. STOCKWELL:   Yes, sir.   We would request

10     that you add in the following after the -- it's your

11     duty to consult with one another.      You must not give up

12     your honest beliefs about the evidence's -- evidence's

13     weight or effect solely because of other jurors'

14     opinions or just to return a verdict.     You must

15     decide -- you must each decide the case for yourself but

16     only after you've considered the evidence with your

17     fellow jurors.

18                  THE COURT:   Well, that is in the Court's

19     existing instructions, and I refer them, again, to those

20     instructions as a whole as a part of this.     So that

21     objection is overruled.

22                  MR. STOCKWELL:   Thank you, Your Honor.

23                  THE COURT:   All right.   Mr. Floyd, if you'll

24     take this signed response back to the jury.

25                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:    Yes, sir.

1                   THE COURT:   And I'll hand this note to the

2      courtroom deputy along with a copy of the Court's

3      response.

4                   All right.   Counsel, we remain in recess.

5                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   All rise.

6                   (Recess.)

7                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   All rise.

8                   THE COURT:   Be seated, please.

9                   The Court's received a seventh note from the

10     jury.   I'll read it and mark it as No. 7 for

11     identification.

12                  The jury has considered the expenses

13     involved and the time and expense to try it again.

14     Regretfully, the jury members are too far apart even

15     after all consideration of all jurors and concessions

16     made to this point.   There is no more room the jurors

17     are willing to negotiate.   Our deepest regrets.    Signed

18     Joyce Foster, jury foreperson.

19                  I'll hand the note to the courtroom deputy

20     for the record.

21                  My intended response to the jury is:

22     Members of the jury, in response to your seventh note,

23     it has been less than one hour since I responded to your

24     last note.   You are instructed to continue your

25     deliberations in accordance with all the Court's prior

1      instructions.

2                   Is there objection from the Plaintiff?

3                   MR. DOVEL:    No objection, Your Honor.

4                   THE COURT:    Is there objection from the

5      Defendant?

6                   MR. STOCKWELL:   Yes, Your Honor.    We would

7      renew our motion for a mistrial.    We do not believe this

8      jury can reach a fair and just verdict.    They are

9      deadlocked, should be dismissed, and a new trial

10     granted.

11                  THE COURT:    That may be the ultimate result,

12     Mr. Stockwell, but I'm not prepared to make that

13     determination at this point in time, and your renewed

14     motion is overruled.

15                  Mr. Floyd, if you would deliver this

16     response to the jury.

17                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   Yes, sir.

18                  MR. STOCKWELL:   One more thing just for the

19     record, Your Honor.     We'd also object to the

20     re-referencing of the Allen charge per the objections

21     previously given.

22                  THE COURT:    All I did is say, it's been less

23     than an hour since I responded to your last note.

24                  MR. STOCKWELL:   Yes, Your Honor, I --

25                  THE COURT:    The response speaks for itself.

1                   MR. STOCKWELL:   Thank you.

2                   THE COURT:   Your objections are overruled.

3                   MR. STOCKWELL:   Thank you, Your Honor.

4                   THE COURT:   We stand in recess.

7                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   All rise.

8                   THE COURT:   Be seated, please.

9                   All right.   Counsel, we've received an

10     eighth note from the jury.    I will mark it as No. 8 for

11     identification.

12                  After I have read it, I will deliver it to

13     the courtroom deputy to be made a part of the file in

14     this case.

15                  The note reads as follows:    Judge Gilstrap,

16     with all due respect to all parties concerned, we cannot

17     reach a unanimous decision after negotiating and making

18     concessions.   We're possibly farther apart than in the

19     beginning.   Also, though we have made progress on the

20     issue of infringement, we cannot come to unanimous

21     agreement on the damages amount.   The positions of the

22     jurors is not going to change.   Signed Joyce Foster,

23     jury foreperson.

24                  I'll hand this note to Ms. Lockhart.

25                  My proposed response, after which I read it,

1      I'll entertain comments or objections from the parties,

2      is as follows:   To the members of the jury, in response

3      to your eighth note, applying all of the Court's

4      instructions previously given to you, if you can reach a

5      unanimous decision on some but not all of the questions

6      within the verdict form, please do so and return that

7      partial verdict.   If you cannot reach unanimous decision

8      on any of the questions within -- within the verdict

9      form, please advise the Court.

10                  Does the Plaintiff have a response or

11     comment on that proposed reply?

12                  MR. DOVEL:    Your Honor, we have no objection

13     to the Court's proposal.

14                  THE COURT:    Does the Defendant have a

15     response or an objection?

16                  MR. STOCKWELL:   Yes, Your Honor.   We would

17     object.   We renew our motion for a mistrial and a new

18     trial.

19                  And just for the Court's -- for the record,

20     I -- the -- the -- the jury note indicates they've made

21     progress on infringement but they've been making

22     negotiations and concessions.    This sounds to us like a

23     totally deadlocked jury and that they're allowed to

24     trade votes, but this sounds like they're deadlocked.

25     These issues of infringement and damages in this case,

1      they're particularly intertwined given the alternate

2      theories on first party and third party which affects

3      the Georgia Pacific factor relating to extent of use,

4      the damages are going to change depending on which of

5      those theories they may have accepted.    There was the

6      Google phone versus the other Android phones.      We just

7      sees these issues as so intertwined that a new trial

8      seems to be the appropriate thing.

9                   THE COURT:   Well, Mr. Stockwell, I

10     understand your comments.     I think this response from

11     the Court will give us a definite answer, and we won't

12     be guessing whether they are on this position or that

13     position.   And if they are not in unanimous agreement on

14     any of the questions, I expect a prompt response from

15     them saying so, at which time I'll certainly allow you

16     to reurge your same motion.    But at this point, you --

17     your motion for a mistrial is denied.

18                  MR. STOCKWELL:    Thank you, Your Honor.

19                  THE COURT:   And I'm going to direct the

20     Court Security Officer to deliver this note to the jury.

21                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   Yes, sir.

22                  THE COURT:   More accurately said, this

23     response to their note.

24                  All right.   With that, we stand in recess.

25                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   All rise.

2                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   All rise.

3                   THE COURT:   Be seated, please.

4                   I have another note from the jury, counsel.

5      I'll mark it No. 9, is that right, for identification.

6                   This simply says:   This is our verdict.

7      Thank you.   Joyce Foster.

8                   I believe that means they have answered some

9      of the questions on the verdict form and not -- my

10     intention is to bring them into the courtroom and

11     inquire if they have a partial verdict to render, and if

12     so, see what it is.

13                  Bring in the jury, please, Mr. Floyd.

14                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:   Yes, sir.

15                  All rise for the jury.

18     seated.

19                  Counsel, be seated.

20                  Ms. Foster, I understand you're the

21     foreperson of the jury.

22                  THE FOREPERSON:   Yes, Your Honor.

23                  THE COURT:   Has the jury answered some but

24     not all of the questions on the verdict form

25     unanimously?

19  



1                    THE FOREPERSON:    Some, yes.

2                    THE COURT:    Would you then hand that verdict

3      form to the Court Security Officer who will bring it to

4      me?

5                    Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to announce

6      this verdict at this time.      I want each one of you to

7      listen very carefully, because after I've done it, I'm

8      going to ask each of you if these answers are your

9      verdict so we can confirm that the questions are

10     answered are answered unanimously.

11                   Turning to the executed verdict form and

12     Question 1:    Do -- did SimpleAir prove by a

13     preponderance of the evidence that Google infringed the

14     following asserted claims of the '914 patent?      Answer

15     yes or no.

16                   Claim 1, yes.   Claim 2, yes.   Claim 3, yes.

17     Claim 7, yes.    Claim 22, yes.

18                   Question 2:    Do you find that Google has

19     proven by clear and convincing evidence that any of the

20     following claims are invalid?     Answer yes or no.

21                   Claim 1, no.    Claims 2, 3, 7, and 22, there

22     is no answer.    But the instruction provides to only

23     answer those if they answered yes to Claim 1.      So that

24     appears to be a complete answer.

25                   Question 3:    Answer Question 3 if you have

20  



1      found at least one claim listed in Question 1 infringed

2      and not invalid.

3                   Question 3 is left blank and is not

4      answered.

5                   The verdict form is signed by Ms. Foster as

6      the jury foreperson and dated with today's date.

7                   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let me

8      poll you and make sure that the verdict that I've just

9      announced into the record is your verdict and those

10     answers were answered unanimously by all eight members

11     of the jury.

12                  If this is your verdict as I've read it into

13     the record, please stand.

14                  (All jurors stood.)

15                  THE COURT:   Thank you.   Please be seated.

16                  Let the record reflect that upon being asked

17     if this was the verdict as read into the record as to

18     Questions 1 and 2 was the unanimous verdict of all eight

19     members of the jury, all eight members immediately in

20     response stood to answer into the affirmative.

21                  Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to accept

22     this partial verdict and that will complete your

23     participation in this trial.   I am releasing you from

24     your responsibilities and duties as jurors in this case.

25     Even though you were not able to answer -- answer

1      unanimously the third question in the verdict form, I

2      and everyone in this room know that you have worked

3      diligently and you have served seriously and with the

4      best motives and efforts of any jury in this country.

5      We thank you for that.    You have the sincere thanks

6      and appreciation of the Court for your service as

7      jurors.

8                    Before you leave the courthouse, and I know

9      we're here on a Saturday and everyone has other places

10     to go and things to do, my practice, after I've accepted

11     a verdict and released the jurors in any case, is to ask

12     the members of the jury to return to the jury room for

13     just a couple minutes and allow me the privilege of

14     coming in personally and thanking you and shaking your

15     hand, and then you'll certainly be free to go.    Now,

16     you're not required to do that.   That's simply a request

17     on my part.    But if you could give me just a couple

18     minutes to express my appreciation in person, I would --

19     I would appreciate that very much.

20                   I also want you to know that after you leave

21     the jury room, you're not under any obligation to

22     discuss this case with anyone, not with any of the

23     lawyers or any of their staff or any one of the parties

24     or anybody else.   By the same token, you are certainly

25     now free to discuss this case with anyone of your

1      choosing, including those people at home that you -- I

2      told you couldn't talk about the case with throughout

3      the entire week, including the people that are in the

4      courtroom, including anyone.

5                    However, I want you to understand that under

6      the practice in this court, because it is that way, if

7      you want to discuss the case and your service as a juror

8      with any of the lawyers in this case, and I know they

9      would be very interested to do that, you will have to

10     initiate the conversation with them.   They are not

11     permitted to initiate the conversation with you.    So as

12     you leave today, if you want to talk with one of the

13     lawyers in this case, go up to them and start a

14     conversation.    If you don't want to talk with any of the

15     lawyers in this case, they will not initiate a

16     conversation with you and you're free to walk right by,

17     go out the door, get in your car, and go wherever you'd

18     like to go.

19                   So at the end of the -- at the end of the

20     day, the answer is it's strictly up to you.    But you are

21     released from my earlier instructions, and you are free

22     to discuss the case with anyone of your choosing.     You

23     are also equally free not to discuss it with anyone you

24     don't want to discuss it with.    That's the custom and

25     practice in this court.

1                    So with those instructions, you are released

2      from your service as jurors.      I accept this partial

3      verdict.   I'll deliver it to courtroom deputy to become

4      a part of the file in this case.         And if you would do me

5      the honor of just a few minutes to thank you in person,

6      I will see you in the jury room in just a second.

7                    You're excused.

8                    COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

9                    (Jury out.)

10                   THE COURT:    Counsel, I'm going to take a few

11     minutes with the jury in the jury room, and then I will

12     be back in.    We will discuss where we go from here.         You

13     stand in recess in the meantime.

14                   (Recess.)

15                   THE COURT:    Be seated.

16                   MR. STOCKWELL:    My apologies, Your Honor.

17                   THE COURT:    No, it's not a problem, counsel.

18                   All right.    We're back on the record.

19                   I've accepted the partial verdict that's

20     been returned by the jury.      The jury has been dismissed

21     and released and has now left the courthouse.

22                   Do I have any motion from the Plaintiff with

23     regard to the unanswered question regarding the amount

1      move for a new trial --

2                   THE COURT:   Please go to the podium.

3                   MR. DOVEL:   Yes, Your Honor, we want to move

4      that the Court enter a partial judgment on infringement

5      and validity and that the Court declare a mistrial on

6      damages and we have a new trial on damages.

7                   THE COURT:   All right.   Is there a response

8      to that motion from the Defendant?

9                   MR. STOCKWELL:    Your Honor, we would oppose

10     that motion on the grounds that all of the issues are

11     intertwined, and we would move for a mistrial on all

12     issues and a new trial on all issues.

13                  And, particularly, Your Honor, we move for a

14     new trial on infringement and damages.     Those issues are

15     too intertwined, and we view it as a defense to

16     infringement.

17                  THE COURT:   All right.   Counsel, I'm going

18     to afford both parties an opportunity to file written

19     motions in support of what you've just moved the Court

20     to do orally.   I'd like those filed within the next two

21     weeks.   And after I've reviewed them carefully, and I'm

22     sure the appropriate authorities you will each be

23     citing, then I will get you an answer.

24                  With that, this trial is completed and

25     you're excused.   Thank you.

2                   MR. DOVEL:   Your Honor, I just want to thank

3      Your Honor and the court staff on behalf of my client

4      and also your law clerk, if you'd pass it on, we really

5      appreciate their hard work.   Thank you.

6                   THE COURT:   All right.   Those words are

7      appreciated.

8                   We're in -- this trial is complete, and,

9      again, you're excused.

11                  THE COURT:   All right.
