01:55:28   12   do it again.

01:55:30   13              All right.     Let's proceed.

01:55:31   14              THE WITNESS:     I apologize, Your Honor.

01:55:34   16   BY MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:

01:55:34   17   Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Kiaei.

01:55:36   18   A.   Good afternoon, sir.

01:55:37   19   Q.   Are you one of the world's leading acoustic processing

01:55:41   20   experts?

01:55:41   21   A.   I -- I have worked on acoustic and audio processing for

01:55:51   22   many years.

01:55:51   23   Q.   Do you agree with counsel's statement in openings that

01:55:54   24   you're one of the world's leading acoustic processing

01:56:02   25   experts?

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 336 Filed 10/09/20 Page 51 of 187 PageID #: 19407
                                                                                    1022



01:56:03    1   A.   Counsel was generous.     I would say that I am an expert

01:56:05    2   in this area.

01:56:05    3   Q.   But are you one of the world's leading experts in this

01:56:09    4   area of acoustic processing?

01:56:10    5   A.   I am well-known in my research work, and I'm also --

01:56:13    6   yes, I am.

01:56:14    7   Q.   You have a website, don't you, Dr. Kiaei, where you

01:56:17    8   market yourself as an expert?

01:56:18    9   A.   Yes, I do.

01:56:19   10   Q.   Is that hitechexpertwitness.com?

01:56:22   11   A.   Yes, it is.

01:56:23   12   Q.   On that website, you identify your areas of technical

01:56:30   13   expertise?

01:56:30   14   A.   Yes.    And before I go further in that, I want to

01:56:33   15   emphasize that that website, I developed myself, and I

01:56:37   16   haven't worked on it much.       So that website is still

01:56:42   17   underdeveloped.     There's many things missing in that

01:56:43   18   website.     It is my own creation.

01:56:44   19               THE COURT:   Just a minute.

01:56:45   20               Dr. Kiaei, you're here to answer the counsel's

01:56:47   21   questions.     You're not here to offer explanations that are

01:56:50   22   not called for by the questions.

01:56:52   23               If he wants to know about the status of your

01:56:55   24   website and is it complete and is it still being worked on,

01:56:58   25   he will ask that, but limit your answers to the questions

                                                                                    1023



01:57:01    1   that are asked, please, sir.

01:57:03    2            THE WITNESS:     Yes, Your Honor.      Thank you.     I

01:57:04    3   will.

01:57:04    4            THE COURT:     Let's proceed, counsel.

01:57:06    5            MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:      Your Honor, can we strike the

01:57:08    6   portion of his answer following his initial response?

01:57:10    7            THE COURT:     I'll retain the answer, yes.         The rest

01:57:14    8   of it and before I go further, et cetera, I will strike as

01:57:17    9   non-responsive.

01:57:18   10            Let's proceed.

01:57:20   11   Q.   (By Mr. Lambrianakos)     And you have this website to

01:57:22   12   help you get hired as an expert witness, right?

01:57:25   13   A.   Yes, I do.

01:57:26   14   Q.   Because you enjoy this kind of work, right?

01:57:28   15   A.   Yes, I do.

01:57:29   16   Q.   And it's lucrative; you bill $400.00 an hour for your

01:57:32   17   opinions, right?

01:57:32   18   A.   Yes, I do.

01:57:34   19   Q.   Now, on that website, you list areas of technical

01:57:41   20   expertise that you believe you bring to a potential client,

01:57:45   21   right?

01:57:45   22   A.   Yes, I do.

01:57:46   23   Q.   And you say on that website that you're an expert

01:57:50   24   witness in wireless and wireline communications, right?
