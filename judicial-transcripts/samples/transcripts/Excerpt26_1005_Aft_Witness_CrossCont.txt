12:54:59    2   time we got done with this process that we've been

12:55:04    4   yet determined our seven delays because we haven't used the

12:55:08    5   azimuth angle.     Isn't that right?

12:55:10    6   A.   We have not as of this time used the azimuth portion of

12:55:14    7   that, yes.

12:55:14    8   Q.   So, at this point, we have not determined the delays as

12:55:22    9   required by the claim, correct?

12:55:24   10   A.   Other than the -- that is correct, other than the

12:55:27   11   fact -- well, I'll save that for direct.
