12                       COURT SECURITY OFFICER:          All rise.

13                       THE COURT:      Good morning.      Be seated,

14   please.

15                       I want to thank you, ladies and

16   gentlemen, for being here on time and ready to go this

17   morning.      My name is Rodney Gilstrap.           I'm the resident

18   United States District Judge here in the Marshall

19   Division of the Eastern District of Texas.                I've lived

20   in Marshall since 1981, practiced law here until I went

21   on the bench in 2007.          Grew up in Florida, but I got to

22   Texas as quick as I could to attend Baylor University

23   and Baylor Law School.

24                       I'm married.      I have two grown children

25   and my wife owns and operates a retail floral business

1    here in Marshall.         Now, I tell you all those things

2    because in a few minutes, we're going to ask each of you

3    to tell us basically the same information about each of

4    you.     And I think it's only appropriate that you know as

5    much about me as I'm about to find out about each of

6    you-all.

7                        We're about to engage in the selection of

8    a jury in a civil case involving allegations of patent

9    infringement.       I know that you've seen the patent film

10   this morning, since patent cases involve certain things

11   that ordinary civil cases do not.             In a civil case such

12   as this one, the United States is the only country in

13   the world -- say that again -- the United States is the

14   only country in the world that guarantees a right to a

15   trial by jury in a civil case.

16                       Your being here this morning and

17   participating, you are in a very real way doing your

18   duty as ordinary citizens to preserve, protect, and

19   defend our United States Constitution and particularly

20   the 7th Amendment, which is a part of our Bill of Rights

21   which guarantees that right to a jury trial in a civil

22   case.

23                       I always tell jury panel members, and I

24   believe it more each time I select a jury, that jury

25   service in my view is the second highest form of public
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 4 of 96 PageID #: 15951
4   


1    service that any American citizen can perform.                 Of

2    course, the highest form of public service are those

3    young men and women that serve in our armed forces and

4    put their lives on the line.            But you are -- you are

5    rendering a very real and significant public service by

6    being here this morning.           And I commend each one of you

7    for being here.

8                        Now, when the lawyers address you this

9    morning, which will happen shortly, they're going to ask

10   you questions.        And I want you to understand that

11   they're not seeking to pry into your personal affairs or

12   to inquire unduly into your personal circumstances.

13                       They're entitled to ask questions, and

14   that's for the sole purpose of securing a fair and

15   impartial jury to hear the evidence in this case.

16                       I don't know if it will happen today.              It

17   usually doesn't, but it is possible that you could be

18   asked a question that you believe is so personal and so

19   private that you are uncomfortable answering it in front

20   of the entire jury panel.           If that happens, you just

21   simply need to say you'd like to discuss that with Judge

22   Gilstrap, and I'll make arrangements for you to discuss

23   that outside of the presence of everybody else on the

24   jury panel.

25                       Again, you have that option.           It rarely

1    comes up.      I don't suspect it will this morning, but in

2    case it does, you do have that option.

3                        It's critically important that when

4    you're asked questions this morning as a part of this

5    jury selection process that you give full, complete, and

6    truthful answers.         Please be assured, ladies and

7    gentlemen, there are no wrong answers as long as your

8    responses are full, complete, and truthful.

9                        The trial in this case is going to begin

10   today, after we select the jury.             And I expect the

11   evidence in this case will go through the end of this

12   week.     So we're looking at selecting a jury that can be

13   available to serve from today through the end of this

14   week, which, as I calculate it, is the 17th of January.

15                       If there are any of you on the jury panel

16   that have scheduled surgery for yourself; you have a

17   prepaid vacation with non-refundable airline tickets; if

18   you have something that would prevent you from serving

19   on this jury over that period of time, I need you to

20   raise your hand and let me make a note of it right now.

21                       Anybody have a problem like that?             And

22   you'll keep them up until I get everybody down.

23                       Okay.    No. 10, Ms. Cox; No. 14,

24   Mr. Powell.

25                       And I saw a lady back there.           What is

1    your number, ma'am?

2                        JUROR CROW:      20.

3                        THE COURT:      20?    Thank you.     I couldn't

4    see you for the gentleman in front of you.                That's

5    Ms. Crow.

6                        Is there anybody else that raised their

7    hand?     Those three, okay.

8                        At this time, I'm going to call for

9    announcements in the case of SimpleAir, Inc., versus

10   Google, Inc.       This is Case No. -- Civil Case

11   No. 2:13-CV-587.

12                       And, Counsel, when you give your

13   announcements, if you would, please introduce everybody

14   on your trial team.         And if you have a corporate

15   representative with you who will be here through the

16   trial, please introduce your corporate representative.

17   So with that, what says the Plaintiff?

18                       MR. CAPSHAW:      Your Honor, Calvin Capshaw

19   for SimpleAir, and we're ready to proceed.

20                       With me at counsel table is Mr. John

21   Payne, one of the inventors of the '914 patent.                  And

22   Mr. Tim von Kaenel; he's another inventor on the patent.

23   They'll be with us as representatives for SimpleAir

24   throughout the trial.

25                       Mr. Greg Dovel of Dovel Luner will be

7   


1    counsel.      Mr. Jeff Eichmann of Dovel Luner will be

2    assisting us.       And my partner, Elizabeth DeRieux, will

3    be helping us as well.          We'll also have Caitlin Walker

4    and Diane Kim.        They're in the audience.         There they

5    are.     And they'll be keeping us straight in our case

6    today.

7                        THE COURT:      Good.

8                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, Your Honor.

9                        THE COURT:      Thank you, Mr. Capshaw.

10   What says the Defendant?

11                       MS. AINSWORTH:       Good morning, Your Honor.

12   Jennifer Ainsworth on behalf of Google.

13                       And with me today as co-counsel are

14   Mitchell Stockwell, Ms. Danielle Williams, and

15   Mr. Russell Korn.         And we'll be putting on the -- the

16   case together.        And also from Google is Mrs. Angana

17   Ghosh who's a product manager in Android, and she will

18   be a witness in the case and will be sitting with us

19   representing Google.

20                       And we're ready to proceed.

21                       THE COURT:      Thank you, Ms. Ainsworth.

22                       Ladies and gentlemen, as I've told you,

23   this is a patent case arising under the patent laws of

24   the United States.         What the Plaintiff is claiming in

25   this case as -- is that its patent was infringed by the
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 8 of 96 PageID #: 15955
8   


1    Defendant, and they're seeking money damages because of

2    that infringement.

3                        The Defendant denies that they've

4    infringed the Plaintiff's patent and contend that the

5    patent is invalid.         Now, what I've just told you is a

6    very brief and very informal way of describing the case

7    in layman's terms.         Having seen the patent film, you

8    know more about patent cases than most people in East

9    Texas do already.

10                       Again, just a couple reminders.            During

11   the questioning in this selection process, there are no

12   wrong answers as long as your responses are full,

13   complete, and truthful.

14                       And, again, as I mentioned, the lawyers

15   are not trying to pry unduly.            They're simply seeking to

16   secure a jury that can serve in this case that is fair

17   and impartial.        If any of the lawyers should ask a

18   question that I don't think is proper, I'll certainly

19   let them know that.

20                       But you should understand, ladies and

21   gentlemen, these are experienced lawyers, and I don't

22   expect that to be a problem.            I'm confident that they

23   understand and will stay within the rules of this Court.

24                       One thing I want to call to your

25   attention, because it's quite possible that some of the
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 9 of 96 PageID #: 15956
9   


1    lawyers might ask you about it during the questioning of

2    the jury panel, is the burden of proof.               In a patent

3    case, the members of the panel that are selected to

4    comprise our jury will be called upon to apply two

5    different burdens of proof to the evidence in this case.

6                        The jury will apply a burden of proof

7    known as a preponderance of the evidence as well as a

8    second burden of proof known as clear and convincing

9    evidence.

10                       When responding to lawyer's questions

11   about the burden of proof, I need to instruct you that

12   when a party has the burden of proof on any claim or

13   defense by a preponderance of the evidence of the

14   evidence, it means that you, the jury, must be persuaded

15   by the credible or believable evidence that the claim or

16   defense is more probable true than not true.                 I'll say

17   that again.       More probably true than not true.

18                       Sometimes this is talked about as being

19   the greater weight and degree of credible testimony.

20                       Let me give each of you an illustration

21   in this regard, and I think all of you can see in front

22   of our court reporter, Ms. Holmes, a statue, the Goddess

23   of Justice or Lady Justicia as she's sometimes called.

24   You notice she has three distinct features.                In her

25   right hand, she holds a sword of justice.                You notice
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 10 of 96 PageID #: 15957
10  


1    that she's blindfolded, so she is supposed to be

2    impartial.       And in her left hand, she has raised the

3    Scales of Justice.         And it's the Scales of Justice I

4    want you to focus on as a part of this illustration.

5                         At the close of evidence in this case the

6    Court's going to submit questions to the jury, and the

7    party that has the burden of proof as to those questions

8    by a preponderance of the evidence, if you'll consider

9    that all the evidence during the trial is placed on

10   those two perfectly balanced scales that she's holding,

11   when all the evidence is in and the trial is over, if

12   the party who has the burden of proof by a preponderance

13   of the evidence has those scales tip in their favor,

14   even if it's ever so slightly, then they have met their

15   burden of proving that by a preponderance of the

16   evidence.

17                        On the other hand, when a party has the

18   burden of proving any defense by clear and convincing

19   evidence, it means that you, the jury, must have an

20   abiding conviction that the truth of the parties'

21   factual contentions are highly probable.                Clearly that's

22   a higher standard of proof than the preponderance of the

23   evidence.

24                        So turning back to the same illustration,

25   if you imagine the Scales of Justice perfectly balanced
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 11 of 96 PageID #: 15958
11  


1    and during the trial all of the evidence is placed on

2    those scales, then when the trial is over and the

3    evidence has all come in, the party that has the burden

4    of proof by clear and convincing evidence must have

5    those scales tip in their favor more than ever so

6    slightly.       They must tip substantially in their favor to

7    meet the burden of proof of clear and convincing

8    evidence.

9                         Now, none of this is to be confused with

10   the third burden of proof called beyond a reasonable

11   doubt.      That's the burden of proof used in a criminal

12   case, and it has no application in a civil case such as

13   this whatsoever.         So you should not confuse clear and

14   convincing evidence with evidence beyond a reasonable

15   doubt.      It's -- it is not as high as beyond a reasonable

16   doubt.      But it is a higher burden of proof than by a

17   preponderance of the evidence.

18                        I give you these instructions in case

1                         THE COURT:     Thank you, ma'am.        If you'll

2    pass that microphone back to Mr. Floyd.

3                         Thank you very much, ladies and

4    gentlemen.       I need to tell you just a couple more things

5    before I turn the questioning over to the lawyers.

6                         The jurors that are actually selected to

7    serve in this case will serve in the role of the judges

8    of the facts, and the jurors who are selected will make

9    the sole determination about what the facts are in the

10   case.

11                        Now, my job as the Judge is to rule on

12   questions of law, evidence, procedure, and to control

13   the decorum and flow of evidence through the courtroom.

14   I want to say a couple things to you about our judicial

15   system that hopefully will put things in a proper

16   perspective as we head toward your service -- some of

17   your service as jurors in this case.

18                        In any jury trial -- in every jury trial,

19   there are -- other than the parties themselves, there

20   are three principal participants, the jurors, the Judge,

21   and the lawyers.

22                        Now, with regard to the lawyers, our

23   judicial system is an adversary system which means

24   simply that during the trial, each of the parties will

25   seek to present through their lawyers their respective
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 28 of 96 PageID #: 15975
28  


1    cases to the jury in the very best light possible.

2                         Now, lawyers are frequently criticized by

3    the public and in the media, and the Court has observed

4    that this criticism is often the result of a basic

5    misunderstanding of our adversary system in which the

6    lawyers act as advocates for the competing parties.                   As

7    an advocate, a lawyer is ethically and legally obligated

8    to zealously assert his or her client's position under

9    the rules of our court system.             And by presenting the

10   best case possible on behalf of their clients, the

11   lawyers hopefully will enable the jury to better weigh

12   the relevant evidence and determine the truth and arrive

13   at a just verdict based on that evidence.

14                        Our American system of justice has served

15   our country well for over 200 years, and America's

16   lawyers have been and continue to be a critical part of

17   that process.        So as we go forward and as we begin the

18   trial in this case, even though I may occasionally frown

19   or growl at the lawyers from time to time, that's simply

20   because I'm trying to make sure they stay within the

21   boundaries of our adversary system and the rules of

22   procedure.       But the members of the jury that are

23   selected from this panel need to keep in mind that they

24   are simply doing their jobs, and I think it's important

25   for everyone to be aware of that as we go forward.

1                         Also, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to

2    understand that those of you who are selected to serve

3    as our jury during the trial of this case, you'll notice

4    that I am going to do my very best to make sure that you

5    have no idea about what I think of the evidence because

6    deciding the facts from the evidence is the jury's job,

7    not the Judge's job.          So you should not take any

8    expressions that come from me or that you think come

9    from me as something to consider or as a factor in

10   making your decision about what the ultimate facts in

11   this case are.

12                        At this time, we'll let counsel for each

13   of the parties address the panel.              We'll start with

14   Plaintiff's counsel.

15                        Mr. Capshaw, you have 30 minutes.            Would

16   you like a warning?

17                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Yes, sir.     Five-minute

18   warning.

19                        THE COURT:     All right.      You may proceed.

20                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, Your Honor.

21                        Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Calvin

22   Capshaw, and I represent SimpleAir in this lawsuit.

23   Good morning.        I want to thank you all for your service

24   and for being here.

1    17-year-old named Hannah, and she's at Baylor University

2    now as a freshman.         Her mother is now with her.           Her

3    mother's name is Bonnie.           She is a costumer for Artsview

4    Children's Theater in Longview.             My oldest daughter is

5    Amanda.      She's a theater major.         She's getting her

6    Master's at SMU in Dallas.            I hope you'll join me in

7    wishing that she'll go date across the street at

8    Southwestern Medical School, instead of in the Theater

9    Department.       I hope for that, but that's not happening.

10   I work with Capshaw DeRieux.            It's a law firm with

11   offices in Gladewater.           I've been there since 2008.

12   Before that, I worked for a law firm in Longview.                   I

13   went to Baylor University and graduated from there with

14   a law degree.        I was on one jury once.         Someone picked

15   me, and it was a civil case.

16                        I want to begin my questions to you by

17   introducing you to SimpleAir.             SimpleAir is a company

18   formed by two inventors, Mr. Payne and Mr. Von Kaenel,

19   and their business partner.            And SimpleAir owns a patent

20   that has to do with sending wireless notification

21   messages to computing devices about new information

22   that's on the Internet.           And one of the -- the patent

23   that they own, the '914 patent, is alleged to be

24   infringed by Defendant Google.             Google is a U.S.-based

25   company, and they sell Internet products and services

1    that relate to searches, messaging services, and

2    advertising.       Now, it's the messaging services that are

3    involved in the case.

4                         I want to ask anybody on the panel if you

5    or your spouse have ever worked for Google, Motorola, or

6    Motorola Mobility?         Has anybody on the panel -- okay.             I

7    take it by your silence that no one has worked for

8    Google or their spouses work for Google.

9                         Does anyone own stock in Google,

10   Motorola, or Motorola Mobility?

11                        Now, some of the attorneys that represent

12   Google are Ms. Jennifer Parker Ainsworth.                She's with

13   Wilson Roberts & Cornelius in Tyler.               Does anybody know

14   Ms. -- Ms. Ainsworth or have had any dealings with her

15   law firm?       Would you please raise your hand?

16                        Another attorney that may be involved

17   helping Google in this case is Jessica Hannah.                  Ms.

18   Hannah used to work for Judge Love in Tyler.                 She's now

19   an attorney with Kilpatrick Townsend.               Does anybody know

20   Ms. Jessica Hannah?          Okay.    Thank you.

21                        Now, I'm going to talk very briefly to

22   you about the patents and technology in a minute, but I

23   wanted to mention something about voir dire.                 And when I

24   served on a civil jury, the people -- some of the folks

25   that I was with -- was with thought that if during voir
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 32 of 96 PageID #: 15979

1    dire they didn't say anything, if they kept quiet, that

2    they might avoid being on the jury panel.                And I can

3    tell you that when you don't say anything and you're

4    quiet when the lawyers are asking questions, they'll

5    just assume that you agree with them and you enhance

6    your chances of making it to the panel.                So it's very

7    important that you -- you answer questions and speak up

8    because this is your chance to talk to the lawyers.

9                         Now, I'm sure you wanted to all -- all

10   wanted to come to court today being fair to both sides

11   and not leaning to one side or the other.                However,

12   personal beliefs in life sometimes influence how we look

13   at things.       For example, just from my personal life, I

14   had a bad experience in a construction matter, my wife

15   and I.      And we didn't get involved in a lawsuit, but

16   it's something we won't talk about to this day.                  It

17   consumed two years of our life.             And I would probably be

18   the wrong kind of a juror in a construction dispute.                    So

19   that's the kind of thing I'm talking about, and leaning

20   is what the law calls bias or prejudice.                Bad words

21   outside the courthouse, but it just means you start out

22   leaning to one side or the other.              So that's why I want

23   you talking to me and trying to find out whether today

24   you're leaning one way or the other before you hear the

25   evidence.

1                         Now, Judge Gilstrap has allowed me to

2    talk to you really briefly about the -- about the case

3    before I start asking questions.

4                         Now, this is a patent infringement case

5    as you know about a patent that SimpleAir owns.                  It's

6    the '914 patent, and that's how you'll hear it referred

7    to.

8                         Now, Google provides a feature on its

9    smartphones and computers that we contend uses

10   SimpleAir's invention without our permission.

11                        SimpleAir's '914 patent was born in late

12   1995 when the Internet was just beginning to get

13   popular.      And at that time, people really didn't know

14   how to use the Internet.           And it was a lot of

15   information out there, but people didn't know how to

16   access it.       So that was before Google and other people

17   had Internet everywhere you went.

18                        Mr. Payne and Mr. von Kaenel, who are

19   here in the courtroom today, and their co-inventors

20   thought about how to make it easier for people to find

21   information that they cared about on the Internet,

22   information that was available, and then tell people how

23   to find their way to get that information.

24                        And their solution was a notification

25   service that would send user's computer an alert when
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 34 of 96 PageID #: 15981
34  


1    there was new information on the Internet.                 The user

2    would sign up to receive notifications about the things

3    they cared about, like breaking news; or if you're a

4    baseball fan like me, baseball scores.               And when

5    something happened on the Internet, Mr. von Kaenel and

6    Mr. Payne's invention would send a wireless alert to the

7    user's computer, and it would pop up in an application

8    that matched the information.

9                         So if you got a breaking news alert from

10   CNN, it would pop up on your CNN application.                 And then

11   the user could go back to the Internet, find CNN, and

12   read more about the matter they were interested in.                   The

13   idea was more than a decade ahead of its time, and

14   Mr. Payne and his co-inventors applied for a patent and

15   received the '914 patent.

16                        Now, to finish up, SimpleAir contends

17   that -- that Google infringes the '914 patent because it

18   provides a notification service that uses the patent's

19   technology.       And the two products you're going to hear

20   about are Android Cloud to Device Messaging Service, or

21   C2DM, and Google Cloud Messaging Service.                And those are

22   applications you see on Android and other smartphones.

23                        How many of you have an Android

24   smartphone?       Anybody?

25                        Okay.    We've got some with their hands.

1    All right.       If you'll just keep them up.           Ms. Palmer --

2    Ms. -- excuse me -- Ms. Palmer.

3                         JUROR PALMER:      Yes.

4                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Okay.     And Ms. Brown,

5    Mr. Murray, and Ms. Nolan.

6                         Oh, I'm sorry.      Thank you, Mr. Pemberton.

7                         JUROR DARDEN:      I've got one, too.

8                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, Mr. Burnam

9    (sic).

10                        JUROR DARDEN:      Darden.

11                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Darden.     Sorry.

12                        Ms. Palmer, do you get message alerts on

13   your Android phone?

14                        JUROR PALMER:      Yes, sir.

15                        MR. CAPSHAW:      How many applications do

16   you get those alerts on?

17                        JUROR PALMER:      Probably two.

18                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Okay.

19                        JUROR PALMER:      Maybe three.

20                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Okay.     Is that a feature

21   that you find -- that you find useful?

22                        JUROR PALMER:      Yes.

23                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Who agrees with Ms. Palmer?

24   Do you find your alert features useful on your Android

25   phones?

1                         I see some of you nodding.          Okay.    Thank

2    you.

3                         Now, I want to get to -- to patent

4    lawsuits and lawsuits in general.              There's one patent at

5    issue in the case that was issued by the Patent and

6    Trademark Office, and that's the '914 patent.                 And you

7    saw the video this morning.            The Patent Office issues

8    patents, but they don't enforce patents, so if I have a

9    patent that says I own something, the only place I can

10   enforce that patent is the United States District Court.

11                        Is there anybody who believes on the

12   panel that a person should not come to court to enforce

13   their patent rights?          If you would raise your hand, if

14   you have that belief.

15                        Is there anybody on the panel that

16   believes that we have too many patent lawsuits?

17                        Okay.    I take it by your silence that no

18   one feels that way.

19                        Now, there -- I've often heard it said

20   that people fall kind of into two camps when it comes to

21   patents.      One group says that patents are great

22   inventions -- are great things.             They promote

23   inventions; they help us compete in the world market.

24                        And without intellectual property, you

25   won't have as much research and development, because
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 37 of 96 PageID #: 15984
37  


1    people wouldn't justify all the effort it takes to

2    invent and get patents.           That's one group.

3                         The second group believes that patents

4    shouldn't be protected by the Constitution; that we

5    should have a free market.            If you get a product out

6    there whether it infringes a patent or not, you should

7    be able to do that free from any kind of -- any kind of

8    patent protection.         That's Group 2.

9                         I want to ask a few of you if you fall

10   into one of those camps.

11                        Mr. Brooks, do you have a view one way or

12   the other where -- about patents and patent protections?

13                        JUROR BROOKS:      No, sir.

14                        MR. CAPSHAW:      You're shaking your head

15   no.     Okay, thank you, sir.

16                        Mr. Dilday, you're close to the

17   microphone.       Hi.

18                        JUROR DILDAY:      Hello.

19                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Do you fall into either one

20   of those groups?

21                        JUROR DILDAY:      Yes.     I believe that they

22   should be able to be protected.

23                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, sir.

24                        Let me see if we can ask Mr. Williams.

25   Mr. Williams, thank you, sir.             If I can pick on you for
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 38 of 96 PageID #: 15985
38  


1    a minute.

2                         JUROR WILLIAMS:       Yes, I do believe they

3    should be able to be protected.

4                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you.

5                         And, Mr. Pemberton, how about you, sir?

6                         JUROR PEMBERTON:       Yes, sir.

7                         MR. CAPSHAW:      All right.     Thank you.

8                         How many people agree there are too many

9    lawsuits in general?

10                        Going to be a lot of you.          And there are

11   a lot of lawsuits, even frivolous lawsuits.                 When I was

12   a law clerk with Judge Steger, one time I saw a lawsuit

13   by an inmate because he wasn't allowed to wear his socks

14   in the shower.        He didn't want to take a communal

15   shower, I guess, with his feet exposed.                But I saw that

16   lawsuit.      I don't think that one had a lot of merit.

17                        But I want to talk to some of you that

18   may have had experience as a defendant in a lawsuit.

19                        Has anybody had experience that perhaps

20   you were a defendant in a lawsuit that maybe gives you

21   an attitude about lawsuits in general?               Would you raise

22   your hand?

23                        Is there anybody who -- some of you

24   filled out a questionnaire and you had some experience

25   as to lawsuits.        Is there anybody who had an experience
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 39 of 96 PageID #: 15986
39  


1    with a lawsuit that maybe was negative or difficult for

2    you that causes you to maybe have a negative attitude

3    about people who come to Court?             Is there anybody who

4    feels that way.

5                         Okay.    I take it by your silence that no

6    one feels --

7                         JUROR POWELL:      I haven't had any --

8                         MR. CAPSHAW:      I'm sorry.     Thank you, sir.

9    Mr. Powell.

10                        JUROR POWELL:      I haven't had any court

11   experience, but in my opinion, I think a lot of

12   people -- not all people, but I think a lot of people do

13   take advantage of some of the freedoms that are meant to

14   protect the hard-working American and use it as an

15   escape goat to get ahead the easy way.

16                        MR. CAPSHAW:      And because you feel that

17   way, sir, do you come to the courtroom today sort of

18   leaning towards more towards the Defendant?

19                        JUROR POWELL:      I'm not really leaning

20   either way.       I don't use technology very much.             I always

21   say that I hate my cell phone, but at the same time, in

22   the today's world, you can't live without one.                  So I'm

23   not really leaning one way or another.               I'm just -- in

24   my opinion, a lot of people take things too far as far

25   as going to court.           Not all the times.      There's a lot of
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 40 of 96 PageID #: 15987
40  


1    things that do need to go to court, but -- I mean, a lot

2    of people go -- take things too far.

3                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, Mr. Powell.

4                         Based on how you feel about that, do

5    you -- do you have any feelings about this lawsuit

6    before you've heard any evidence?

7                         JUROR POWELL:      I don't know anything

8    about it, so, no, I don't have any feelings about it.

9                         MR. CAPSHAW:      You haven't formed any

10   beliefs about it.

11                        JUROR POWELL:      No.

12                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, sir.       I

13   appreciate your candor.

14                        Now, when you're -- if you're selected

15   for this panel, you'll hear in the case about the fact

16   that SimpleAir has brought a patent infringement

17   litigation suit against other Defendants.                For example,

18   Microsoft and Apple and those companies eventually

19   licensed the SimpleAir patents.

20                        Is there anyone who feels like they might

21   lean towards the Defendant because SimpleAir enforced

22   its patents against other companies, like Microsoft and

23   Apple?      Does anybody hold that against SimpleAir?

24                        Okay.    I take it by your silence, you

25   don't feel that way.

1                         Is there anybody on the panel that

2    belongs to an organization whose purpose is either to

3    lobby the legislature or be involved with lawsuits and

4    addressing the lawsuit situation?

5                         Does anybody get literature from any of

6    those organizations?

7                         Yes, ma'am, Ms. Cerliano?

8                         JUROR CERLIANO:       Totally unrelated to

9    this, I've belonged to for 39 years and have been a

10   state delegate to our local president for my local Texas

11   State Teacher's Association.            And while our primary

12   purpose is not leg -- lobbying, it is a part of our

13   mission to lobby the state legislature on education

14   issues.

15                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Concerning education?

16                        JUROR CERLIANO:       Right.    Right.     It is

17   lobbying.       It's not related to IT, but it is lobbying.

18   And that is the way you phrased your question.

19                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Yes, ma'am.      Thank you.      I

20   appreciate that.

21                        Does anybody -- is anybody a member of or

22   get literature from the East Texas Against Lawsuit Abuse

23   or the Texans for Lawsuit Reform?              Anybody get that?

24                        Now, who like me reads the Wall Street

25   Journal?
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 42 of 96 PageID #: 15989
42  


1                         Okay.    Ms. Palmer, you read the Wall

2    Street Journal.        Anybody else?

3                         Ms. Palmer, when you get the Wall Street

4    Journal, have you ever heard any articles about patents

5    and patent litigation in the paper?

6                         JUROR PALMER:      I probably glanced at them

7    but not taken them in internally to remember them.

8                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Do you just go to that

9    column on the left and read the news read quick and then

10   pitch it?

11                        JUROR PALMER:      (Nods head.)

12                        MR. CAPSHAW:      That's what I do, too.

13   Okay.     Thank you.

14                        All right.     I want to talk to you a

15   little bit about patents and patent validity.                 Judge

16   Gilstrap will tell you about the presumption of

17   validity.       A patent that goes to the Patent Office is

18   presumed valid, and that's a presumption.                And we don't

19   have to prove that to you, that the patent is valid.

20                        Does anybody have a problem or feel that

21   that's not fair, that patents are presumed valid when

22   they're issued by the Patent Office?

23                        Okay.    No hands.     Thank you.

24                        Does anybody agree with this statement:

25   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office probably makes a
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 43 of 96 PageID #: 15990
43  


1    lot of mistakes when issuing patents.               And it issues a

2    lot of patents that are not any good?               Anybody agree

3    with that?

4                         Yes, ma'am.      Ms. Cerliano, No. 22?

5                         JUROR CERLIANO:       I believe with the

6    exponential growth in technology and a lot of other

7    areas nowadays that it's practically impossible for the

8    Patent Office to research everything and always be

9    right.

10                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Okay.     Who agrees with

11   Ms. Cerliano about that?

12                        Yes, sir, Mr. Powell.

13                        Anyone else?

14                        Mr. Howell.

15                        Ms. Cox, did you raise your hand?            Okay.

16   Thank you.

17                        Ms. Cox and Mr. Conrett (sic).           And we

18   have No. 23, Mr.         Murray, No. 25, Mr. Darden.

19                        JUROR DARDEN:      Right.

20                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, sir.

21                        And Ms. Nolen.      All right.      Thank you.

22                        Now, there are some people today who,

23   because of the way things are, believe the government is

24   so out of touch or out of control that they're not

25   interested in anything, an agency of the government,
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 44 of 96 PageID #: 15991

1    like the U.S. Patent Office has to say.                And it's okay

2    to feel that way, but I need to ask you:                Does anybody

3    feel that way; that the government is so out of control

4    that you don't have any interest in what a government

5    agency might say about something?

6                         Okay.    I don't see any hands.

7                         Now, SimpleAir is a company founded by

8    the inventors of the patent, the '914 patent.                 And

9    SimpleAir owns the patents, but it does not manufacture

10   cell phones, smartphones.           It does not offer a messaging

11   service.

12                        Is there anyone here who believes that a

13   company that owns patents and invents but doesn't

14   manufacture or sell -- is there anybody believes they're

15   entitled to less protection of their patent rights than

16   a company that sells products?

17                        Okay.    I don't see any hands.         Thank you.

18   Is there anybody who believes -- this is a little bit

19   different question -- that companies who do not

20   manufacture or sell products should not even have

21   patents?      Is there anybody who feels that way?

22                        Okay.    I don't see any hands.         All right.

23   Thank you.

24                        Now, I want to talk to you and ask you a

25   few questions about burden of proof, the preponderance
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 45 of 96 PageID #: 15992
45  


1    of the evidence burden of proof.              Now, SimpleAir has the

2    burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence its

3    case on infringement and also on damages.                And we gladly

4    accept that burden.          And as Judge Gilstrap described

5    that to you, it was -- our burden is to tip the Scales

6    of Justice just ever so slightly on infringement and

7    damages to carry our burden.

8                         Is there anybody that would have a

9    problem applying that burden and following Judge

10   Gilstrap's instructions in this case on preponderance of

11   the evidence?

12                        Okay.    I don't see any hands.

13                        Is there anyone else who thinks this is a

14   big case; it's important so SimpleAir's burden on

15   infringement and damages ought to be heavier?                 Anybody

16   feel our burden out to be heavier than a preponderance

17   of the evidence?

18                        All right.     Now, the Defendant, as one of

19   their defenses, Google will say that our patent is

20   invalid.      And Judge Gilstrap's already talked to you

21   about that burden being a heavier burden; that you have

22   to tip the scales substantially and that you have to

23   have an abiding conviction that the matter is highly

24   probable.

25                        Is there anybody that would have trouble
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 46 of 96 PageID #: 15993
46  


1    applying that heavier burden to Google's claim that the

2    '914 patent is invalid?           Is anybody -- anybody have a

3    problem with that?

4                         Now, some people say it's not fair that

5    the Plaintiffs have a lesser burden to prove

6    infringement and damages than the Defendant has to prove

7    invalidity.       And it's okay to feel that way.

8                         Is there anybody that feels it's not fair

9    that Google has the burden to prove by clear and

10   convincing evidence that the patent is invalid and that

11   that burden is heavier than SimpleAir's burden?                  Anybody

12   think that's unfair?

13                        I don't see any hands.         Thank you.

14                        Has anybody ever been elected to a

15   position like a school board president, a water

16   district, a hospital district, where you were elected

17   and then appointed by your fellow board members to be a

18   chairperson or an officer?

19                        Ms. Cerliano, I know you were a

20   representative.

21                        Anybody else had that experience where

22   you were elected?

23                        Anybody been on a committee and been a

24   chairperson of that committee?

25                        Ms. Cox, No. 10.       Yes, ma'am, were you

47  


1    elected as a committee -- as a chairperson?

2                         JUROR COX:     Yes, sir.      I have several

3    different committees at school and foreman of a jury

4    once.

5                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you.

6    Anyone else?

7                         Ms. Palmer.      I don't mean to pick on you,

8    Ms. Palmer.

9                         JUROR PALMER:      That's okay.      I figured

10   I'd be a natural target.           I've served on church

11   committees.       I've served on Chamber of Commerce

12   committees, various civic organizations.

13                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Okay.    Thank you very much.

14                        All right.     I want to ask a little bit

15   different question.          Has anybody here ever had an

16   opportunity -- I'm sorry.           Thank you.      Yes, sir?

17                        JUROR DARDEN:      Just various civic and

18   church committees.

19                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Okay.

20                        THE COURT:     Let's wait until you get the

21   microphone, Mr. Darden, so we can hear you.

22                        If you'll stand up, sir.

23                        Go ahead and give us your answer.

24                        JUROR DARDEN:      Just a member -- Steve

25   Darden.      Just a member of civic and church committees.

1                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Yes, sir.     And you were the

2    chairperson?

3                         JUROR DARDEN:      Chairperson, yes.

4                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, Mr. Darden.

5                         Has anybody had an opportunity to join a

6    collective bargaining unit or a union and declined to do

7    so?

8                         Okay.    Mr. Bryant?      Mr. Bryant, did you

9    have an opportunity to join a collective bargaining unit

10   and decided not to?

11                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, I have.

12                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Have you ever also been a

13   member of collective bargaining unit?

14                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, I have.

15                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Done both?

16                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, sir.

17                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Anyone else like Mr. Bryant

18   who had an opportunity to join a collective bargaining

19   unit and you declined?

20                        Okay.    Ms. Cox -- excuse me --

21   Ms. Cerliano.

22                        JUROR CERLIANO:       I was saying -- I was

23   pointing out that it's illegal in my profession.

24   Collective bargaining doesn't exist and school districts

25   are considered public employees, so collective

1    bargaining is not an option for me.

2                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Yes, ma'am.      Thank you.

3                         Anybody a member of a collective

4    bargaining unit or union?

5                         Okay.    I've got three:       2, Mr. Prestidge;

6    4, Mr. Brooks; and Mr. Pemberton.

7                         Mr. Prestidge, do you remember if it was

8    a collective bargaining unit or a union, I guess.

9                         JUROR PRESTIDGE:       Yes, sir.     Union.

10                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Yes, sir.     And that was for

11   10 years, if I'm remembering correctly?

12                        JUROR PRESTIDGE:       Yes, sir.

13                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, sir.

14                        Mr. Brooks, are you a member of a

15   collective bargaining unit?

16                        JUROR BROOKS:      Teamsters.

17                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Teamsters.     And you're

18   still a member now?

19                        JUROR BROOKS:      Always.

20                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, sir.

21   Mr. Pemberton?

22                        JUROR PEMBERTON:       The US Steelworkers of

23   America.

24                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Okay.    All right.

25                        JUROR PEMBERTON:       Thirteen years.

1                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Thirteen years.       Thank you,

2    sir.

3                         Ms. Cerliano, any NEA/TSTA?

4                         JUROR CERLIANO:       That's a part of -- it

5    is a part of the NEA, which is a union and does do

6    collective bargaining in other states, but it's illegal

7    in Texas.

8                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you.     All right.      Is

9    anybody a member of the Chamber of Commerce?                 We have

10   any Chamber of Commerce members here?               Okay.

11                        THE COURT:     Five minutes, Mr. Capshaw.

12                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you, sir.

13                        Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to

14   try to wrap up quickly.           I want to miss any growls from

15   the Judge, so I'm going to try to wrap it up.

16                        In this case you're going to hear later,

17   SimpleAir is going to have a damage expert that's going

18   to say that SimpleAir's royalties in this case should be

19   $126 million.        And my question really doesn't concern

20   damages.      But I want to know if there are any of you for

21   whatever reason that thinks an award up to $126 million

22   is just simply too much money to give to one company,

23   doesn't matter what the evidence is, doesn't matter the

24   value of the -- the invention, doesn't matter what the

25   evidence shows, that's just too much money.                 Does
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 51 of 96 PageID #: 15998
51  


1    anybody feel that way?           Okay.    I take it by your

2    silence, that -- that no one does.

3                         All right.     I'm going to close up, and

4    then turn it over to Google.             But sometimes, you know,

5    people wish I would have asked a question.                 I don't ask

6    all the questions that I should probably, and I'm not

7    perfect.      So after all you've heard, there may be some

8    of you that are sitting there that are thinking, well,

9    if that lawyer had just asked me the right question, he

10   would not want me on his jury.             And so I'm going to ask

11   you right now, is there anyone who is thinking that way

12   right now, that I should have asked you a question and

13   didn't?

14                        All right.     Is -- after all you've heard

15   and you haven't heard any evidence yet, is there anybody

16   that just maybe -- maybe feels like they're leaning

17   toward the Defendant Google in this case before we start

18   the case?       Anybody feel that way?

19                        Well, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you

20   for your time.        I think that those of you selected will

21   get to participate in a great American tradition.                   I

22   think you'll enjoy your service, and I'll look forward

23   to working with you, as does SimpleAir.

24                        Thank you, Your Honor.

25                        THE COURT:     All right.      Ms. Ainsworth,
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 52 of 96 PageID #: 15999
52  


1    you may address the panel on behalf of the Defendant.

2                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you, Your Honor.

3                         THE COURT:     And would you like a warning?

4                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Yes, Your Honor, five

5    minutes, please.

6                         THE COURT:     All right.      You may proceed.

7                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Good morning, ladies and

8    gentlemen.       We met a few minutes ago, but my name is

9    Jennifer Ainsworth and I represent Google, along with my

10   co-counsel, and we look forward to presenting this case

11   to the people that are eventually selected on this jury.

12                        Let me start out the same way that you

13   guys did and answer the same questions that you did for

14   the Court.       I live in Tyler.       I've got two sons who are

15   10 and 13.       I work at a -- at a law firm in Tyler, and

16   I've been there about 12 years.             I worked in Houston

17   before that.       I went to -- I'm from Hallsville

18   originally; graduated from Hallsville High School.                   And

19   then went to University of Texas and then UT also for

20   law school.       My husband's name is Charlie Ainsworth, and

21   he's a lawyer also in Tyler.            And I have never served on

22   a jury.      I've been on jury panels like you're doing this

23   morning, but for some reason they've never selected me.

24   So that's my background, and we appreciate you sharing

25   your background with us.

53  


1                         So I'd like to start out -- the Judge --

2    Judge Gilstrap gives us an opportunity to take just a

3    couple of minutes and tell you a little bit about what

4    we think the issues are in the case so you have some

5    context.      And then I want to ask, you know, some of your

6    opinions and thoughts.

7                         As you may have kind of gathered already,

8    this case has to do with smartphones and smartphone

9    technology, and particularly the issue of how

10   notifications or messages are sent to smartphones.

11                        Google's come a long way from when it

12   started.      It's an Internet search engine started by two

13   guys who were students, but they've developed other

14   products and services.           And one of the things that they

15   developed a few years ago is the Android operating

16   system.

17                        And some of you said you had Android

18   phones.      Android is an operating system that can be

19   integrated into smartphones, and those are built by

20   other companies, for example, Samsung, or LG, they're

21   some of the companies that manufacture Android phones.

22   Google provides the Android operating system free of

23   charge.      It's called Open Source.          And you may hear

24   about some of that in the case.

25                        Now, the Plaintiff in this case
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 54 of 96 PageID #: 16001
54  


1    represented by Mr. Capshaw, SimpleAir, is saying that

2    Google is infringing their patent in the way messages

3    are sent from application developers to smartphones.                    We

4    disagree.       Google says that we did not infringe their

5    patent.      And so the issue in the case is going to --

6    you're going to hear about Google messaging service, and

7    -- and Mr. Capshaw mentioned that earlier.

8                         Some of you said that you had smartphones

9    that have apps on them.           Apps are applications that are

10   usually developed by other companies like, for example,

11   Facebook or The Weather Channel, ESPN.               And you might

12   install them on your phones.            Google has some apps of

13   its own, but most of them are like GMail.                But most of

14   the apps come from outside companies.               And so the

15   messaging service is a system where the app companies

16   can convey a message to a cell phone or a smartphone.

17   The app provider sends a message to Google who forwards

18   that on to the smartphone.

19                        Now, we believe that Google's messaging

20   system operates in a different way than what's covered

21   by SimpleAir's patent, and we also say that their patent

22   should not have been issued and that it's not valid --

23   or it's invalid.

24                        THE COURT:     We need to move on to

25   specific questions, Ms. Ainsworth.

1                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you, Your Honor.

2                         Let me ask you first if anyone here knows

3    any of the counsel that represents SimpleAir, Mr.

4    Capshaw or Ms. DeRieux from her firm in Gladewater?                   Has

5    anybody worked with them or been represented by them in

6    the past?       Or any of the other counsel, Mr. Eichmann and

7    Mr. Dovel representing SimpleAir?

8                         Anybody here -- I know that Mr. Capshaw

9    asked if anybody had rep -- had worked for Google.

10   Anybody here has not used Google?              Anyone here who has

11   not used any of our services or products?                That's great.

12   We're -- we're glad that you do.

13                        Does anyone -- and let me start with the

14   folks who are in the jury box.             Anyone have any opinions

15   about Google or their reputation or their policies or

16   their products that would make you start out this case

17   with some hard feelings or bad feelings about Google?

18   Anything that you've run into or heard that you would

19   hold against Google?          Don't worry about hurting our

20   feelings because this is the point that we need to know

21   it.

22                        And, Mr. Bryant, if I could ask you --

23   have you had some kind of issue in the past that -- that

24   you didn't like?

25                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, ma'am.

56  


1                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     Can you tell us

2    generally what that was?

3                         JUROR BRYANT:      I'm a -- I'm a member of

4    several online forums that have to do with firearms, and

5    Google has in the past year stopped allowing any firearm

6    industries to advertise with them, sell their products

7    through their services, or whatever.               And I -- I think

8    that's about as un-American as you can get in this

9    country.

10                        MS. AINSWORTH:      So you believe that

11   policy is un-American, and I gather that's something

12   that -- that you believe in fairly strongly?

13                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, ma'am, it is.

14                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     Is that something

15   that you would hold against Google if you were sitting

16   on the jury in this case?

17                        JUROR BRYANT:      In a patent case, I don't

18   think it would apply.

19                        MS. AINSWORTH:      What if you heard about

20   Google's policies and procedures in this case and that

21   was something that you had to -- that you had to hear

22   evidence about.        Would you start out Google behind

23   SimpleAir at the beginning of the case?

24                        JUROR BRYANT:      No, I wouldn't.       I -- I

25   believe in let's get to the truth.               I think that's --
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 57 of 96 PageID #: 16004
57  


1    that's the root of everything right there.                 We got to

2    get to the truth.

3                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     Thank you very

4    much.     I appreciate that.

5                         JUROR BRYANT:      Okay.

6                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Let me ask the folks that

7    are sitting in the -- in the benches here.                 Like Mr.

8    Bryant, has anyone there had any issues or concerns with

9    Google that you might hold against the company as we

10   start this case?         Bad experiences?         Problems with a

11   product?      Anything like that?         Okay.     I don't see any

12   hands.      Thank you.

13                        As you've heard, we're going to be

14   talking about smartphones, and in particular about

15   Android smartphones.

16                        Let me start back with the people in the

17   jury box.       Let me ask you kind of a general question.

18   When you purchased your smartphone -- there's a lot of

19   different smartphones on the market these days -- when

20   you purchased yours, what made you decide on that

21   particular smartphone?           Anybody have any, you know,

22   features, things they like, things they didn't like?

23                        Okay.    I'm going to have to -- I'm going

24   to have to call on someone.

25                        Mr. Dilday, could you tell us what things
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 58 of 96 PageID #: 16005
58  


1    made you pick one phone over another?

2                         JUROR DILDAY:      I have currently the

3    iPhone 4S, and it's simply because I had an

4    Android-based phone prior.            Everybody was raving about

5    it that I was around, and so I figured I'd give it a

6    shot.     And that's about it.         I mean, I do utilize it.            I

7    do like it, but I also liked my previous phone, as well.

8                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     So you had an

9    Android phone in the past.            You don't have one now.         Is

10   that -- would that cause you any problem if you're

11   hearing about Android issues in this case?

12                        MR. DILDAY:      No, ma'am.     My wife has an

13   Android phone, so it -- it doesn't matter to me.

14                        MS. AINSWORTH:      While I've got you --

15   while you've got the microphone, if you don't mind ask

16   -- can you tell us a little bit about your business.

17                        You said that it deals with telephone

18   technology?

19                        JUROR DILDAY:      Yes, ma'am.      We are an

20   inmate telephone communications company.                We actually

21   originated with old pay phones that we served in

22   transition, then to the inmate industry as the cell

23   phones took over.

24                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Do you deal with

25   smartphone technology as part of your daily business?
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 59 of 96 PageID #: 16006
59  


1                         JUROR DILDAY:      No, ma'am, not as far as

2    the technology portion, no, ma'am.              Phone calls to

3    smartphones or cellular phones, yes, ma'am, but not

4    actual -- not at this moment.

5                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.

6                         JUROR DILDAY:      You're welcome.

7                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Let me -- let me ask a

8    more general questions about your smartphones.                  You've

9    heard that one of the issues in the case has to do with

10   notifications or messages and how they're sent to

11   smartphones.       When you bought your phone, did anybody

12   take into account or make your decision based on how it

13   handled notifications?           Did anyone on the jury box take

14   that into account when you made your decision?                  I don't

15   see any hands there.

16                        Did anyone take that into account -- the

17   people sitting in the court, when you made your decision

18   on what phone to purchase?            Thank you very much.

19                        We're obviously here today because

20   SimpleAir has a patent, and they told you they believe

21   that that's infringed.           And we disagree.       But we saw in

22   your questionnaires that there were some people who knew

23   somebody who had a patent or maybe had applied for a

24   patent.      And I wanted to follow up with a couple of

25   people about that.

1                         Let's see, Mr. Williams, No. 15.

2                         JUROR WILLIAMS:       Yes, ma'am.

3                         MS. AINSWORTH:      It looked like -- had

4    your father obtained a patent?

5                         JUROR WILLIAMS:       Yes, ma'am.

6                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     What was that on?

7                         JUROR WILLIAMS:       He and his wife.       It was

8    called a Spar-Pro.         It was a sparring dummy, basically

9    upper torso with a weighted base.              My father used to be

10   a Golden Gloves boxer and -- and boxed for years and I

11   grew up around it.         And he eventually -- selling it to

12   -- or at least the idea to -- to police forces because

13   the material was tense enough to accept thousands of

14   rounds from firearms.          And so they use it at police

15   academies.       And it's -- as far as I know, it's still

16   being sold.

17                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Do you know if -- was

18   there ever any -- any situation where your father filed

19   a lawsuit or had any litigation over his patent?

20                        JUROR WILLIAMS:       Not that I was aware of.

21   I know there's -- I mean, just like the case we're

22   probably going to hear today -- I mean, there's --

23   things can be so closely related, you know, when it

24   comes to products or services, that some very minute --

25   minute detail could be the main separation, you know,
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 61 of 96 PageID #: 16008
61  


1    between, you know, the Spar-Pro and its competition.

2                         So, you know, I believe it's -- if

3    there's an idea that makes one product better than the

4    other or one service better than the other, by all

5    means, you know, protect that right.

6                         MS. AINSWORTH:      And let me ask you.         The

7    fact that your father obtained a patent, you could say

8    it sort of puts you in a similar position to SimpleAir

9    because they own a patent that's going to be discussed

10   in this case.        Does that fact cause you to start out

11   this case favoring SimpleAir over Google?

12                        JUROR WILLIAMS:       Not at all.      Not at all.

13                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.

14                        I think Ms. Foster, No. 1, I believe, had

15   you mentioned on your questionnaire that your son had

16   developed a product or had he applied for a patent?

17                        JUROR FOSTER:      He never applied for the

18   patent.      He developed a product and it was used for

19   quite a long time to protect a computer device, I think,

20   in the semitrucks, but he never applied for a patent.

21   He talked about it, but just felt like it was not going

22   to be worthwhile.

23                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     Is there anything

24   about that experience with your son and hearing about

25   that that would cause you to favor SimpleAir over Google
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 62 of 96 PageID #: 16009
62  


1    in this case?

2                         JUROR FOSTER:      No, I don't think so.

3                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.

4                         Has anybody else on the panel -- either

5    they or someone in their family obtained a patent or

6    tried to obtain a patent?

7                         Ms. Cox?     Who was that, if you could tell

8    us?

9                         JUROR COX:     My dad a long time ago

10   developed and got a patent for -- it's funny, a bathroom

11   toilet magazine holder.

12                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Important thing.

13                        JUROR COX:     Well, he thought it was, and

14   he had them made and gave them away because he couldn't

15   sell them.       But, yes, he did get a patent.            And then he

16   complained because somebody else stole his idea, but he

17   never did anything with it, so...

18                        MS. AINSWORTH:        Okay.    So he thought

19   someone had -- had used --

20                        JUROR COX:     Copied it, yes.

21                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     But he didn't file

22   a lawsuit?

23                        JUROR COX:     No, he didn't.       He was a

24   Baptist preacher.         He didn't do that.

25                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Anything about that
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 63 of 96 PageID #: 16010
63  


1    experience that would cause you to favor SimpleAir?

2                         JUROR COX:     No, not really.

3                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Mr. Dilday, did you

4    indicate that --

5                         JUROR DILDAY:      Yes.

6                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Do you have a patent or

7    know someone who --

8                         JUROR DILDAY:      No, ma'am.      Well, the

9    company I work for, my brother-in-law's co-owner of

10   that, and they've applied for different patents.                  I

11   don't know exactly the content of each one of them, but

12   I do know one of them had to do with three-way call

13   detect, so...

14                        MS. AINSWORTH:      And do you know if those

15   patents have issued, or is that process still pending?

16                        JUROR DILDAY:      I believe it's still

17   pending, but I'm not certain as to the -- where -- where

18   it actually lies at this point.

19                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     Has there ever

20   been any kind of litigation or suits having to do with

21   those patents or those applications?

22                        JUROR DILDAY:      No, not those

23   applications.        I know that we were involved in a -- a

24   lawsuit company-wise where we were told that our -- the

25   company I worked for had infringed on a -- a patent, but
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 64 of 96 PageID #: 16011
64  


1    that was settled.

2                         MS. AINSWORTH:      When -- was that

3    something fairly recent or when was that?

4                         JUROR DILDAY:      I believe it was in the

5    last year.

6                         MS. AINSWORTH:      And the suit was brought

7    against your company?

8                         JUROR DILDAY:      Yes.

9                         MS. AINSWORTH:        Was it resolved before

10   it went to court?

11                        JUROR DILDAY:       Yes, ma'am.

12                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     Is there anything

13   about that circumstance that would cause you to favor

14   SimpleAir over Google in this case?

15                        JUROR DILDAY:      No, ma'am.

16                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.

17                        Anybody else in the jury box that either

18   has a patent, you family -- someone in your family does?

19                        How about in the audience, anybody have a

20   patent or someone in their family?

21                        Mr. Pemberton, were you wondering --

22   okay.     Sorry, I misunderstood.

23                        Ms. Cox mentioned something about -- and

24   her father's idea maybe being used by someone else.                   I

25   want to ask if there's anyone who ever has seen a
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 65 of 96 PageID #: 16012
65  


1    product that had a new idea and thought that they

2    thought of that product first or they thought of that

3    idea first and someone was using it without their

4    permission?

5                         Mr. Powell, have you had that situation

6    in the past?

7                         JUROR POWELL:      I wouldn't necessarily say

8    that it's something that I have thought about and

9    somebody else is using, but I am a welder.                 I have

10   always -- even since I was a little kid, worked with my

11   hands.      If there's something that I think of that would

12   help benefit me, I build it and I use it for myself.                    I

13   do not try to sell it, don't try to patent it.                  It's

14   something to benefit me, and I have built stuff and seen

15   something similar later.           But it's not like, oh, these

16   people stole my idea.          I do it to benefit and make my

17   life easier.       And what other people do is other people's

18   business.

19                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Is there anything about

20   that experience or your -- the decisions that you made

21   there that would cause you to start out this case

22   favoring SimpleAir before you've heard any of the

23   evidence?

24                        JUROR POWELL:      No.    All the stuff I do is

25   little.      I mean, it's just -- you know, they're

1    talking -- I mean, I get -- in fact, I have an MLB app

2    on my phone.       And every time the Texas Rangers score or

3    the team they're playing scores, I get a notification

4    that lets me know about it.            I work nights.       I can't

5    watch the games.         And so the -- it's not something as

6    small as being around the house.              I mean, it's

7    worldwide.       So their situation and my situation is

8    completely different.

9                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.         I

10   appreciate it.

11                        In your questionnaires, I think, Mr.

12   Bryant, did you mention that maybe you had had an idea

13   that you thought had been taken by someone else having

14   to do with some packaging?

15                        JUROR BRYANT:      Seriously, I'm not trying

16   to be funny, but yeah, I had stuck that on there.                   I was

17   just laughing at myself.           Many, many years ago, someone

18   would take a bowling ball and put it in a cow patty.                      It

19   could be sold as ashtrays.            Two years later, they were

20   doing it.

21                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Well, is there anything

22   about that situation that would cause you to favor

23   SimpleAir over Google in this case?

24                        JUROR BRYANT:      No, I don't think so.

25                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you.

1                         Okay.    Well, while I've got you,

2    Mr. Bryant, if you don't mind, let me ask you:                  I think

3    there's some people that indicated in there

4    questionnaires that they had brought a lawsuit or

5    thought about bringing a lawsuit for one reason or

6    another through the years.            Had you been in a situation

7    where someone in your family had brought a lawsuit

8    before?

9                         JUROR BRYANT:      I did.

10                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     And was -- who was

11   that against if -- and if you -- if I'm treading on

12   something that's private.

13                        JUROR BRYANT:      I cannot remember the name

14   of the company.        It was in 1965.        It was frozen food.         A

15   tractor/trailer rig run a stop sign, run over me on my

16   motorcycle.

17                        MS. AINSWORTH:      So it was an injury that

18   you suffered.

19                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, ma'am.

20                        MS. AINSWORTH:      That puts you sort of in

21   the position of the Plaintiff in this case because

22   they're the ones bringing this lawsuit:                Would that

23   cause you to start out this case favoring SimpleAir over

24   Google?

25                        JUROR BRYANT:      No, ma'am.

1                         MS. AINSWORTH:      And how long ago was

2    that?

3                         JUROR BRYANT:      '64.

4                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.

5                         Has anybody else in the jury box had a

6    situation where they brought a lawsuit against somebody?

7    Mr. -- Mr. Prestidge?

8                         JUROR PRESTIDGE:       Yes.

9                         MS. AINSWORTH:      What type of case was

10   that, if you could tell us just in general?

11                        JUROR PRESTIDGE:       Defamation of character

12   and slander.

13                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.

14                        JUROR PRESTIDGE:       Contractor fired us

15   all.     Put out letters on us.         Called us a bunch of

16   shitheads.       I sued them.      It might be one day they don't

17   call me one.

18                        THE COURT:     Mr. Prestidge, I'm sure

19   that's an accurate answer, but I'm going to instruct you

20   not to use profanity in this courtroom.

21                        JUROR PRESTIDGE:       Yes, sir.

22                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Mr. Prestidge, how long

23   ago was that lawsuit?

24                        JUROR PRESTIDGE:       '86/'87.

25                        MS. AINSWORTH:      And has anyone else in

69  


1    your family been involved in any kind of litigation?

2                         JUROR PRESTIDGE:       My wife fell at

3    Walmart, injured herself.           Walmart didn't want to do

4    nothing.      It's what they got lawyers for.

5                         MS. AINSWORTH:      The fact that you were

6    involved or your wife was involved in -- in lawsuits in

7    the past, does that make you in any way, before you hear

8    this evidence, favor SimpleAir over Google?

9                         JUROR PRESTIDGE:       None at all.

10                        MS. AINSWORTH:      All right.      Thank you,

11   sir.

12                        Let me ask the people sitting in the

13   audience.       There's -- anyone there that has been

14   involved where you were in the position of bringing a

15   lawsuit or thought about bringing a lawsuit, seriously

16   considered it?        Anybody?

17                        Okay.    And I just noticed a couple things

18   in the questionnaires.           Mr. Williams, let me ask you one

19   other question.        Did you consider bringing one in a

20   case, but decided not to do that?

21                        JUROR WILLIAMS:       Yes, ma'am.      It was a

22   wrongful termination lawsuit against a local company,

23   and the only attorneys locally that handled that type of

24   suit were already in cahoots with the company I was

25   trying to sue.        And they basically hung the phone up on
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 70 of 96 PageID #: 16017
70  


1    me.     And after about four months of pursuing other

2    avenues, I gave up and just got another job.

3                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Anything about that

4    experience, about considering filing a lawsuit that

5    would make you have hard feelings about Google or make

6    you lean toward the Plaintiff in this case?

7                         JUROR WILLIAMS:       No, ma'am, not at all.

8                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.

9                         We're obviously here today because

10   SimpleAir has sued Google.            Does anybody have an issue

11   or a problem with Google wanting to defend themselves in

12   this case and wanting to bring the case to trial and put

13   on our side of the case for you?

14                        Does anybody have a problem with that, or

15   would you hold that against Google?

16                        I don't see anybody in the jury box or

17   anyone in the chairs.          Thank you.

18                        Ladies and gentlemen, one of the other

19   issues in this case is going to be whether SimpleAir's

20   patent is valid or whether it should have been issued by

21   the Patent and Trademark Office.              Let me ask you if --

22   Mr. Capshaw asked you some questions about whether

23   people had opinions on one side about patents.                  Let me

24   kind of ask you on the other.

25                        Patents are issued by the Patent and
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 71 of 96 PageID #: 16018
71  


1    Trademark Office, and you heard a little bit about that

2    on the video this morning.            But does anybody feel like,

3    you know, regardless of what the evidence is, regardless

4    of what the Judge says, if a patent was issued by the

5    United States Government, I could never find it invalid?

6    If it was issued by a governmental agency, I don't care

7    what the evidence is, there is no way I would ever find

8    that invalid or question what was valid, does anybody

9    feel that way?

10                        Mr. Bryant, you feel that way?

11                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, ma'am, I do.        If the

12   Patent Office gives somebody a patent, it's their

13   patent.      It should never be invalidated until the patent

14   time limit runs out.

15                        MS. AINSWORTH:      All right.      Thank you

16   very much.

17                        Does anybody feel the same as Mr. Bryant,

18   that, you know, outside of whatever the evidence is, it

19   was issued by the Patent and Trademark Office and,

20   therefore, it is valid and shouldn't be questioned?

21                        Mr. Powell, you feel that way, too?

22                        JUROR POWELL:      I don't necessarily feel

23   never, but it would take a lot, because -- I mean,

24   it's -- it's their job.           I'm not saying everybody that

25   they're perfect, but it is their job to look at
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 72 of 96 PageID #: 16019
72  


1    everything.       And without them, then who knows how the

2    system would be.

3                         The patents are a good thing, and very

4    minor details are very easily looked over.                 So it would

5    take a lot, but I'm not going to say never I wouldn't be

6    able to ever find one invalid, but it would take a lot.

7                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.

8                         A patent is what we would call a property

9    right.      It's not property like real estate, but it's

10   intellectual property.           Let me ask you one kind of

11   further question along this:            Does anyone feel like if a

12   patent is a property right, regardless of what the

13   evidence is or what the Judge says, I could never take

14   that away from somebody?           I could never take that away

15   from a company or a person and find it invalid?

16                        Does anyone -- other than Mr. Bryant or

17   Mr. Powell who have kind of told us their views, does

18   anybody else kind of feel that way?

19                        JUROR COX:     Can you repeat that, please?

20                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Yes, ma'am, Ms. Cox.         If

21   a patent is considered a property right, does anyone

22   feel like, regardless of the evidence, I could never

23   take someone's property away?

24                        Yes, Mr. Bryant?

25                        JUROR BRYANT:      The way you're wording
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 73 of 96 PageID #: 16020
73  


1    that --

2                         MS. AINSWORTH:      I understand that you

3    feel that way and thank you very much.               Does anybody

4    else feel like Mr. Bryant in that respect?

5                         THE COURT:     You have five minutes,

6    Counsel.

7                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you, Your Honor.

8                         Ms. Cox, you're kind of questioning

9    there?

10                        JUROR COX:     I am.      I sort of -- I agree

11   with him, but, you know, people make mistakes.                  But I

12   also know where I work they have intellectual property

13   rights for things that I have developed and I develop

14   things all the time.          But if you were to leave them, I

15   could change a minute detail, make it mine.                 Is that

16   wrong?      I don't know.

17                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.         I

18   appreciate it.

19                        Let me ask some questions of some people

20   that we haven't heard from yet and not let you get off

21   without -- without asking you a couple of questions.

22                        Mr. Davis, No. 6, I understand that you

23   work in the legal profession.             You work for -- is it

24   Legal Services of Northern Louisiana?

25                        JUROR DAVIS:       Yes.

74  


1                         MS. AINSWORTH:      What kind of work do you

2    do for the company?

3                         JUROR DAVIS:      I'm the office assistant.

4    I file all the stuff at the courthouse, and we just --

5    we do civil cases.         There's no criminal; just family

6    law.

7                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     And are you --

8    does your -- does your office usually represent people

9    who are bringing the cases or people who are being sued?

10                        JUROR DAVIS:      It's the people, either/or.

11                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.

12                        JUROR DAVIS:      It's either/or.

13                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you very much.

14                        Ms. Love, if I could ask you a couple of

15   questions.       You're a certified medication --

16                        JUROR LOVE:       Yes.

17                        MS. AINSWORTH:      -- aide?     How long have

18   you been doing that work?

19                        JUROR LOVE:      Basically since about '97.

20                        MS. AINSWORTH:      And then you also work on

21   tax preparation?

22                        JUROR LOVE:      Yes, but I'm not working in

23   the medical field.

24                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     So you don't do

25   the medical work anymore.           You're just doing the tax

75  


1    preparing?

2                         JUROR LOVE:      I just do the tax preparing,

3    but I still keep my certification up.

4                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     Thank you very

5    much.

6                         And, Ms. Palmer, since you are a

7    lawyer -- and is your law license still active?                  Are you

8    still practicing in any respect?

9                         JUROR PALMER:      I do not practice.        I took

10   inactive status with the Louisiana State Bar in the

11   early '90s.

12                        MS. AINSWORTH:      When you practiced, did

13   you do any kind of patent work or intellectual property

14   work?

15                        JUROR PALMER:      No, I did commercial -- I

16   had pretty much an office practice.              I did some

17   commercial litigation.           But generally speaking, I

18   avoided intellectual property matters.

19                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you.      Does anybody

20   on this jury panel know anybody else on the jury panel?

21   Mr. Williams, who do you know?

22                        JUROR WILLIAMS:       I just realized I knew

23   Randy Dilday.

24                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     You're both in the

25   Hallsville area.

2    close when we were younger.            They used to be friends.

3                         MS. AINSWORTH:      Thanks.

4                         Anybody else on the panel know anybody

5    else?

6                         That's all.

7                         Ladies and gentlemen, you spent a lot of

8    time this morning.         We appreciate your time.          We

9    appreciate your being straightforward and talking to us

10   and sharing your thoughts and opinions, and we look

11   forward to presenting this case to you.

12                        Thank you.

13                        THE COURT:     All right.      Counsel, approach

14   the bench, please.

15                        (Bench conference.)

16                        THE COURT:     Plaintiff have any members of

17   the panel they wish to challenge for cause?

18                        MR. CAPSHAW:      None from the Plaintiff,

19   Your Honor.

20                        THE COURT:     Defendants have any they wish

21   to challenge?

22                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Yes, Your Honor.         No. 8,

23   Mr. Bryant.

24                        THE COURT:     What's the basis for that?

25                        MS. AINSWORTH:      The basis?

1                         THE COURT:     Other than he doesn't like

2    you dropping your gun ads off Google?

3                         MS. AINSWORTH:        Right.     That and his

4    comments that he could never find patents invalid.

5                         THE COURT:     Okay.

6                         MR. STOCKWELL:        He's pretty firm in that,

7    Your Honor.

8                         THE COURT:     Anybody else you'd like to

9    challenge for cause?

10                        MR. STOCKWELL:        I did have questions

11   about the conflicts that 10, 14, and 20 raised, but I

12   assume the Court will address that.

13                        THE COURT:     Yes.     I'll do that.      So

14   otherwise, no challenges for cause other than Mr. Bryant

15   from the Defendant?

16                        MS. AINSWORTH:        No.     That's all, Your

17   Honor.

18                        THE COURT:     Okay.        Y'all have a seat.

19                        (Bench conference concluded.)

20                        THE COURT:     All right.        Ladies and

21   gentlemen, I'm going to excuse the majority of the

22   panel.      I'm going to ask some of you to remain, and I

23   have some questions to talk about you -- talk about with

24   you at the bench.

25                        For those of you that I'm excusing, a

1    couple instructions.          No. 1:    Stay inside the building.

2    Restrooms are out these double doors and to the left as

3    are the water fountains, but please stay close by.

4                         Second instruction:        Don't discuss

5    anything that happened during jury selection this

6    morning.      You have not heard any evidence yet, but

7    nonetheless talk about any subject; the weather, the NFL

8    playoffs, or anything you want to, but don't talk about

9    what happened in here during the process this morning.

10                        And for those of you who I'm asking to

11   stay, if you'll just step out of the way and keep your

12   same seats, and I'll call you up here one at a time.

13                        So with that, I'm going to excuse

14   everybody on the panel temporarily with those

15   instructions, except Panel Members No. 8, 10, 14, 15,

16   and 20.      So everybody but those folks, you are excused

17   at this time.

18                        COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

19                        (Jury panel out.)

20                        THE COURT:     All right.      Be seated,

21   please.

22                        If you'll make sure that back door is

23   closed, Mr. Floyd.

24                        Counsel, if you'll approach the bench.

1                         THE COURT:     I'm going to take these in a

2    different order.         Mr. Williams, will you come up,

3    please?

4                         This is -- step up, Mr. Williams.             If

5    you'll be sure to speak to that -- speak quietly.

6                         This is my question:        You indicated you

7    served on the Gregg County Grand Jury before?

8                         JUROR WILLIAMS:       Correct.

9                         THE COURT:     Do you live in Gregg County?

10                        JUROR WILLIAMS:       I used to, two years

11   ago.

12                        It's a Longview address, but it's

13   Harrison County.

14                        THE COURT:     I understand.       I just wanted

15   to make sure, because Gregg County is not in our

16   division; Harrison County is.             You're excused.       Just

17   don't discuss anything about the case.

18                        JUROR WILLIAMS:       So I go outside?

19                        THE COURT:     Yes, sir.

20                        Mr. Bryant, would you come up, please,

21   sir?

22                        We're going to talk softly.          You're

23   perfect.

24                        Let me ask you this, Mr. Bryant:            I heard

25   your comments about Google, and you didn't like the fact
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 80 of 96 PageID #: 16027
80  


1    that they'd stop their -- allowing gun-related

2    advertisements and things like that.               I also heard you

3    say you didn't think that would apply in a patent case.

4    I need to know if you can be fair and impartial on this

5    jury and treat Google just like SimpleAir, or whether,

6    for whatever reason, you're going to treat Google a

7    little differently, probably more negatively, than you

8    would SimpleAir?         That's basically my question to you.

9                         JUROR BRYANT:      I don't think I would.         I

10   think I would treat both parties the same.

11                        THE COURT:     Okay.    Now, you've made a

12   comment about being able to declare a patent invalid.                      I

13   think you said that would be a difficult thing for you

14   to do.

15                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, sir.     I think the

16   Patent Office may make mistakes occasionally, but not

17   that often.

18                        THE COURT:     Okay.    If the evidence showed

19   you by clear and convincing evidence that the patent in

20   this case was invalid, could you find it invalid?

21                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, sir, I sure could.

22                        THE COURT:     All right.      Any questions,

23   Mr. Stockwell, Ms. Ainsworth?

24                        MS. AINSWORTH:      If I could ask one

25   question, Your Honor.

1                         Mr. Bryant, you mentioned that you

2    thought Google's policy about -- can you hear, Your

3    Honor -- you mentioned that you thought Google's policy

4    about taking those ads down was un-American.

5                         Do you have strong feelings about whether

6    Google's -- Google is an un-American company or a deeply

7    held view of the type of company they are because of

8    that?

9                         JUROR BRYANT:      No, ma'am.      I just think

10   that that policy is un-American.              Google is an American

11   company.      I know that, so it's not it's not the issue.

12                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Okay.     All right.     Thank

13   you, sir.

14                        JUROR BRYANT:      You're welcome.

15                        THE COURT:     Any questions from the

16   Plaintiff?

17                        MR. CAPSHAW:      No, Your Honor.

18                        THE COURT:     All right.      Mr. Bryant, I'm

19   going to excuse you to join the rest of the group

20   outside.      Just don't discuss anything that's happened in

21   here.

22                        JUROR BRYANT:      Yes, sir.

23                        THE COURT:     Thank you.

24                        I'm not going to excuse Mr. Bryant.             He's

25   indicated he can be fair and impartial.                He may think

1    one of their policies is un-American, but I think that

2    stems more from his strong feelings about the Second

3    Amendment than Google itself.             And he was clear that he

4    could treat Google just like he could SimpleAir.                  So I'm

5    going to overrule the challenge for cause to Mr. Bryant.

6                         Ms. Cox, would you join us, please?

7                         And we're going to talk softly, but if

8    you'd just talk right into that little microphone with

9    me.

10                        JUROR COX:     Okay.

11                        THE COURT:     You indicated you had a

12   scheduling problem that might prevent you from being

13   available all week.

14                        JUROR COX:     Well, for Friday.        I've got a

15   prepaid flight at 11:30 on Friday.

16                        THE COURT:     Where are you going?

17                        JUROR COX:     Austin for a family reunion.

18                        THE COURT:     Okay.    When's the family

19   reunion?

20                        JUROR COX:     Friday night, Saturday.

21                        THE COURT:     Okay.    Well, it's possible we

22   might be through by Friday, but probably not at 11:00,

23   and certainly probably not early enough for you to get

24   to the airport.        Are you flying out of Longview?

25                        JUROR COX:     Gregg County.

1                         THE COURT:     Gregg County?

2                         JUROR COX:     Uh-huh.

3                         THE COURT:     Okay.     All right.

4                         JUROR COX:     I would be happy to do it if

5    I -- you know, if it could be done.

6                         THE COURT:     Well, that's -- that's what I

7    asked.      Okay.     Why don't you join the group outside?

8    Just don't discuss anything about this case.                 But I'm

9    going to excuse you so you don't have to worry about

10   being selected.

11                        JUROR COX:     Thank you.      Okay.

12                        THE COURT:     Mr. Powell.

13                        All right.     I'm going to excuse Ms. Cox.

14                        MS. AINSWORTH:         Your Honor, if we might,

15   just for the record, object to her being excused just

16   because Austin is not that far away and she could

17   probably join the family reunion that evening.

18                        THE COURT:     Your objection is noted.

19                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you.

20                        THE COURT:     We've got plenty of people on

21   the panel.       There's no way she can get to Austin by 11

22   o'clock unless you all give me back a lot of time during

23   this trial.         So all things considered, I don't see a

24   reason to make her be late for a family reunion,

25   especially since she's already got a prepaid ticket

84  


1    that's been bought.

2                         All right.     Mr. Powell, you indicated you

3    would have possibly a scheduling problem with serving

4    during the whole week if you were selected on the jury?

5                         JUROR POWELL:      Yes.

6                         THE COURT:     Tell me about that.

7                         JUROR POWELL:      I have an eye appointment

8    this Wednesday at 2:00 o'clock.             I'm currently in the

9    process of getting fitted for contacts.                I'm going

10   skiing at the end of January, and I've been noticing my

11   vision has been a little off, so I'm trying to get my

12   vision back right so I can steer right down the slope.

13                        THE COURT:     Where -- where do you have

14   this appointment?

15                        JUROR POWELL:      It's at Kilgore Eyecare or

16   Kilgore Eye Center, I believe.

17                        THE COURT:     Okay.

18                        JUROR POWELL:      But it's in Kilgore,

19   Texas.      It's at 2:00 o'clock this Wednesday.

20                        THE COURT:     All right.      If we needed you

21   to serve, could you reschedule that and still get your

22   eyes fixed before you go skiing at the end of the month?

23                        JUROR POWELL:      Well, this is my first

24   re-fitting and I have -- don't know how long -- they try

25   and leave a week in between, like I went originally last
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 85 of 96 PageID #: 16032
85  


1    Wednesday.

2                         THE COURT:     Uh-huh.

3                         JUROR POWELL:      And I got to go back this

4    Wednesday and possibly go back the next Wednesday.                   They

5    try and leave about a week in between, and I don't know

6    -- they said normally it takes two to three trips.                   I'm

7    leaving Friday, the 31st, to go to Colorado.

8                         THE COURT:     Okay.     All right.     Anything

9    else I need to know about your schedule for this week

10   other than the eye appointment?

11                        JUROR POWELL:      I believe that's it.

12                        THE COURT:     Okay.     I'm going to excuse

13   you to join the rest of the group outside.                 Just don't

14   discuss anything about what we talked about in here.

15                        JUROR POWELL:      Okay.

16                        THE COURT:     Thank you.

17                        I'm not going to excuse Mr. Powell.             He

18   can certainly reschedule at the eye clinic without any

19   difficulty, and he didn't give the Court any concrete

20   reason as to why he could only go this week, so those

21   things considered, I'm not going to excuse him.

22                        Ms. Crow, would you come up, please?             Ms.

23   Crow, you indicated you might have a scheduling problem

24   serving this week.         Tell me about that.

25                        JUROR CROW:      Yes, for one, I mentioned

1    that I do baby-sit for my sister and my brother-in-law

2    for their 18-month-old.           Well, my sister is starting

3    college this week, and we don't have a day care center

4    anywhere in Atlanta.          And, two, I'm sick.        I've got a

5    rash --

6                         THE COURT:     I see that.

7                         JUROR CROW:      -- under my arm, and it's

8    not just my arm.         It's my stomach and my legs and hips,

9    as well.      And I was going to go to the doctor for it

10   this morning, but I had to come here.

11                        THE COURT:     Okay.

12                        JUROR CROW:      And I was going to call, but

13   I didn't have a phone number.

14                        And, three, I don't have a car.            I had to

15   borrow my son's.         Luckily he was off today.

16                        THE COURT:     But he's not going to be off

17   every day of this week?

18                        JUROR CROW:      No.

19                        THE COURT:     Okay.    I'm going to excuse

20   you, Ms. Crow.

21                        JUROR CROW:      Plus his car, the starter is

22   going out so I have to constantly click it -- click it

23   to get it to start.

24                        THE COURT:       Well, you've got more

25   problems than anybody I have to deal with.                 I'm going to

1    excuse you.       Go ahead and join the rest of the group

2    outside.      Don't discuss anything about what we said in

3    here, but you're not going to be on the panel for jury

4    selection.

5                         JUROR CROW:      Okay.    Thank you.

6                         THE COURT:     Thank you.      Uh-huh.

7                         All right.     Counsel, how long do you need

8    to exercise your peremptory challenges?

9                         MR. CAPSHAW:      Can we have 20?

10                        THE COURT:     Let's make it 11:30.         I'll

11   give you 17.       All right.

12                        MS. AINSWORTH:      Thank you.

13                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Thank you.

14                        (Bench conference concluded.)

15                        THE COURT:     All right.      The Court will

16   stand in recess while counsel exercises their peremptory

17   challenges.       We'll reconvene at 11:30.          The Court stands

18   in recess.

19                        COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

20                        (Recess.)

21                        (Jury panel in.)

22                        COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

23                        THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

24                        All right.     Ladies and gentlemen, if you

25   will listen carefully as your name is called, if you'll

1    come forward and take your seat in the jury box.                  We're

2    going to seat eight jurors in this case, so I'd like to

3    put the first four on the front row and the second four

4    on the back row.         And given that there are extra seats

5    in the box and to -- to position the jury so that it

6    will be in the center of the box, I'd like to leave the

7    last two seats on each row.            And that means the seats

8    toward the doors coming into the courtroom.                 I'd like to

9    leave those two seats empty.

10                        So Juror No. 1 will actually come to the

11   front row of the box and sit in the third seat down, and

12   I think that should be clear.             And then the second row

13   will do likewise.

14                        So with that, Ms. Lockhart, our courtroom

15   deputy, will call the names of the persons selected to

16   serve on our jury at this time.

17                        COURTROOM DEPUTY:       Joyce Foster, Randy

18   Dilday, Philip Norris, Richard Davis, Mary Love, Conrett

19   Allen, Jonathan Williams, and Samuel Pemberton.

20                        THE COURT:     All right.      Would you be

21   seated, please.

22                        Those of you that were not selected to

23   serve in this case, I'm about to excuse you at this

24   time.     I excuse you with the sincere thanks of the

25   Court.      As I said earlier, you're performing a

1    significant public service by being here.                And I

2    recognize, as does everyone on the Court staff, that

3    each of you not selected had other places you could have

4    been this morning, other important things you could have

5    been doing, but it's vital to our system of justice that

6    you come and be willing to serve and be a part of the

7    panel, even though you weren't selected.                And you have

8    our sincere thanks for doing that.

9                         The only thing I would ask is when your

10   name is called again and you get to come back for jury

11   service in the future, just have the same positive

12   attitude we've seen today, and we'll appreciate it very

13   much.

14                        If you need anything for your employment,

15   please see Ms. Martin and the ladies in the Clerk's

16   Office.      They'll be glad to furnish you anything

17   regarding that.        And with that, ladies and gentlemen,

18   those of you not selected to serve on this jury are

19   excused at this time.

20                        (Jury panel out.)

21                        THE COURT:     Members of the jury, if you

22   will stand at this time, Ms. Lockhart will administer

23   the oath to you.

24                        (Jurors sworn.)

25                        THE COURT:     Be seated, ladies and

1    gentlemen.

2                         I'm about to excuse you for lunch, but

3    before I do, I need to give you a few additional

4    instructions.        This case is going to be decided solely

5    on the evidence that you hear in the courtroom and the

6    exhibits that are permitted to be received into evidence

7    during the trial.         Those are the only two sources of the

8    evidence that you'll base your verdict on.

9                         Up until this point, ladies and

10   gentlemen, you've heard absolutely no evidence in this

11   case.     What the lawyers tell you in this case is not

12   evidence.       That is simply their contentions of what they

13   think the evidence will show, but it is not evidence.

14                        Therefore, it's essential that the case

15   be decided solely upon the evidence that is presented

16   during the trial so that you as the judges of the facts

17   can make your decisions based solely on that evidence.

18                        Accordingly, it is absolutely essential

19   that there be no outside influences, no outside

20   information, nothing other than the sworn testimony and

21   the exhibits admitted into evidence that you should base

22   your verdict and your decision about the facts in this

23   case on.

24                        So as I excuse you for lunch today, I'm

25   excusing you with the specific instruction that you not
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 91 of 96 PageID #: 16038
91  


1    discuss the case among yourselves or with anyone else.

2                         And I can promise you that you'll hear

3    that instruction from me just about every time you get

4    up and step out of that jury box until the case is over.

5    And the reason I'm so repetitive with it is that it is

6    so vital and critical that there be no outside

7    influences, no outside information, that your decisions

8    in this case as the jury are based solely upon the sworn

9    testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits that come in

10   during the trial.         So don't discuss the case with

11   anyone.

12                        And until the evidence is all in and I

13   excuse you to retire to the delib -- to the jury room to

14   deliberate on your verdict, don't discuss the case among

15   yourselves.       Only after all the evidence is in and I've

16   excused you to deliberate on the verdict, then and only

17   then can you discuss the case among yourselves.                  Until

18   then, not among yourselves and not with anyone else

19   anywhere else to any degree whatsoever.

20                        Along those same lines about avoiding any

21   possible outside influences, whether it's over lunch

22   today and you're using your smartphone, whether it's at

23   home tonight and you're using your computer, don't go

24   online and do any research about this case.                 Don't seek

25   to gain any information from any source other than the
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 92 of 96 PageID #: 16039
92  


1    sworn testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits that

2    are admitted during the trial.

3                         Also, as far as not communicating about

4    the case in any way, that not only means verbal

5    communications, like a conversation, that means any

6    other type of communications.             So if you're users of

7    social media, whether it's Facebook or MySpace or

8    Twitter or any of the other many, many types of social

9    media out there, don't post anything, don't -- don't

10   publish anything digitally, electronically about this

11   case whatsoever.         That's just as much an unpermitted

12   communication as having a conversation with somebody

13   about the case would be.

14                        And as I said earlier, don't seek to do

15   any research, whether it's online or at the local

16   library or the newspaper or anywhere else.                 Don't seek

17   to do any research.          Again, the point is your

18   information that you base your verdict on in this case

19   must be limited solely to the sworn testimony from the

20   witnesses during the trial and the exhibits that are

21   admitted into evidence.           Those are the only two sources

22   from which you should make a decision.

23                        I don't think it will happen in this

24   case, it -- it is possible, but it is very rare.                  But

25   now that you have been selected as jurors in this case,
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 93 of 96 PageID #: 16040
93  


1    it is possible that some third party at some point might

2    try to approach you and influence you to rule a certain

3    way or to make a certain decision in this case.                  Again,

4    I think that's very unlikely, but I want you to know

5    it's possible.        Therefore, if at any time you feel that

6    you've received or someone's attempted to communicate

7    with you in an in -- in an inappropriate way, for

8    possibly the purpose of influencing you or getting you

9    to rule a certain way, then you should let the Clerk's

10   Office know immediately.           They'll notify me, and the

11   Court will deal with it.           Again, I don't think that's

12   likely, but it is possible.            So I want to at least put

13   you on notice about that.

14                        I'm going to excuse you for lunch until

15   1:00 o'clock.        I'd like you back in the jury room

16   assembled and ready to go about five minutes until 1:00,

17   and we'll do our best to start the evidence at 1:00

18   o'clock -- or start the trial at 1:00 o'clock this

19   afternoon.

20                        A couple other housekeeping matters.             If

21   you brought your cell phones with you, leave them in

22   your cars.       Don't bring your cell phones into the

23   courtroom.       There will be breaks and recesses during the

24   day where if you need to check e-mail or something like

25   that, you'll have an opportunity to go to your vehicle
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 94 of 96 PageID #: 16041
94  


1    and do that, but don't bring any electronic devices into

2    the courtroom.

3                         Also, if you haven't already done so, at

4    some convenient time, at least before you leave today to

5    go home, make sure that Ms. Martin in the Clerk's Office

6    has an accurate cell phone number that can be used to

7    reach you at any time.           If for any reason the Court

8    needed to get a message to you, I'd need a cell phone

9    number where we could do that.

10                        Again, don't discuss the case among

11   yourselves or with anyone else.             Have a good lunch.        And

12   we'll see you back here ready to go at 1:00 o'clock.

13                        You're excused for lunch at this time.

14                        COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

15                        (Jury out.)

16                        THE COURT:     All right.      Be seated,

17   please.

18                        Is there anything from the Plaintiff

19   before we recess for lunch?

20                        MR. CAPSHAW:      Nothing from the Plaintiff,

21   Your Honor.

22                        THE COURT:     Anything from the Defendant?

23                        MR. STOCKWELL:         Your Honor, I would

24   like to know if we can use this opening slide.

25                        THE COURT:     I will get you an answer
Case 2:11-cv-00416-JRG Document 610 Filed 01/23/14 Page 95 of 96 PageID #: 16042
95  

1    before 1:00 o'clock.          I've got a copy of it and my clerk

2    has a copy of it.

3                         MR. STOCKWELL:      Thank you, Your Honor.

4                         THE COURT:     All right.      Anything else,

5    Mr. Stockwell?

6                         MR. STOCKWELL:      That's it, Your Honor.

7                         THE COURT:     All right.      Counsel, you're

8    excused for lunch.         We'll start back at 1:00 o'clock.

9                         COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

10                        THE COURT:     Court stands in recess until

11   then.
