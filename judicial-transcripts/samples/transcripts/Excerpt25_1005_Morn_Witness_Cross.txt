11:58:32    4   Q.   But the question, sir, was, with respect to the number

11:58:36    5   of samples.     You're saying the number of samples is somehow

11:58:38    6   related to this Fast Fourier Transform, but that Fast

11:58:41    7   Fourier Transform has nothing to do with the weighting

11:58:44    8   factors.     We apply the weighting factors later when we get

11:58:47    9   to the Ws.     Right?

11:58:48   10              THE COURT:    Is that a question, counsel?       I heard

11:58:50   11   about five statements, and then a question at the end.

11:58:53   12              MR. HADDEN:    I'll rephrase it.    I apologize,

11:58:56   13   Your Honor.

11:58:56   14   Q.   (By Mr. Hadden)     You talked about the geometry somehow

11:59:01   15   being in the weighting factors.

11:59:03   16              Isn't it true, sir, that when we're doing the

11:59:06   17   Fourier Transform and we're creating these Xs, we haven't

11:59:11   18   dealt with anything regarding the geometry of those

11:59:15   19   microphones?     We're just dealing with the outputs and these

11:59:18   20   128 samples per frame; isn't that right?

11:59:21   21   A.   No, that's not correct.

11:59:22   22   Q.   So are you saying that the number of samples from each

11:59:27   23   microphone varies depending on its angle with respect to

11:59:32   24   the reference axis?

11:59:33   25   A.   There's nothing in the claim that says the number of

                                                                                    708



11:59:35    1   samples varies in accordance with; it's just represented by

11:59:40    2   a number of samples.

11:59:41    3   Q.   Okay.   But if the delays are going to be different,

11:59:47    4   then the number of samples has to be different, right?

11:59:50    5   A.   No.

11:59:50    6   Q.   No?

11:59:51    7   A.   It doesn't have to be.       It can be.

11:59:53    8   Q.   If you're going to have two delays that are not the

11:59:56    9   same and each of them is represented by or in terms of a

12:00:01   10   number of samples, don't the number of samples have to be

12:00:07   11   different between those two?

12:00:08   12   A.   The eventual result would result in a factor that when

12:00:13   13   it's converted back to a time domain would be

12:00:18   14   representative of a difference, yes.

12:00:19   15   Q.   But nowhere in this diagram or this process, have we

12:00:23   16   determined anything in terms of a number of samples other

12:00:27   17   than a fixed 128-sample frame, right?

12:00:32   18   A.   Again, that's per frame, and then you -- you -- the

12:00:35   19   different -- the value is different based upon the

12:00:36   20   weighting factors.       So it's going to be a difference.

12:00:44   21              THE COURT:    Let me interrupt here, gentlemen.

12:00:46   22              MR. HADDEN:    Sure.

12:00:46   23              THE COURT:    It's clear this cross-examination has

12:00:48   24   some additional time to go, and we're at the noon hour now.

12:00:51   25   So we're going to recess for lunch.
