# Feature 02I Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of feature-02I which fixed critical issues with page parsing, field naming, and section boundaries in the judicial transcript parsing system.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Field Naming Issue
**Problem**: The field `Page.parsedTrialLine` was incorrectly named - it actually contains a page number, not a line number.

**Solution**: Renamed field to `Page.parsedTrialPage` throughout the system:
- Updated Prisma schema
- Modified all parsers (TranscriptParser, EnhancedPageHeaderParser, EnhancedLineParser)
- Updated test files

### 2. Missing Page 2 in Summary
**Problem**: Page 2 of the summary section was not being created when page headers were encountered within the summary.

**Solution**: Added page break detection within summary processing:
- Check for page breaks while processing summary lines
- Create new page records when page headers are found
- Properly track page numbering across summary pages

### 3. Duplicate Page 3 Issue
**Problem**: Page 3 was being created twice - once at the end of summary and again at the start of PROCEEDINGS.

**Solution**: Modified PROCEEDINGS detection to reuse existing page:
- When PROCEEDINGS is detected, use the last created page instead of creating a new one
- Sync page numbering variables to maintain consistency
- Continue line numbering from where summary left off

### 4. CERTIFICATION Page Missing Headers
**Problem**: CERTIFICATION pages were missing header information (pageId, parsedTrialPage, etc.).

**Solution**: Look backwards for page header before CERTIFICATION marker:
- Search up to 10 lines before CERTIFICATION for page break
- Extract page info from the actual header location
- Properly populate all page header fields

### 5. Trial Page Numbering Reset
**Problem**: `trialPageNumber` was resetting to 1 for each new session instead of continuing from previous session.

**Solution**: Implemented global page counter:
- Added `globalTrialPageNumber` to track pages across all sessions
- Increment for each new page created
- Ensures continuous numbering (session 2 starts at 126 after session 1 ends at 125)

### 6. SessionSection Parsing Issues
**Problem**: 
- "VOCALIFE LLC," was incorrectly included in COURT_AND_DIVISION section
- Law firm information was creating duplicate CASE_TITLE sections
- No separation between case title and transcript info

**Solution**:
- Improved case party detection regex to identify company names
- Added TRANSCRIPT_INFO section type for "TRANSCRIPT OF JURY TRIAL" and session type
- Prevented CASE_TITLE detection when already in APPEARANCES section
- Fixed section boundaries to properly separate content

## Files Modified

### Core Parser Files
- `/src/parsers/TranscriptParser.ts` - Main parsing logic
- `/src/parsers/EnhancedPageHeaderParser.ts` - Page header extraction
- `/src/parsers/EnhancedLineParser.ts` - Line parsing
- `/src/parsers/SessionSectionParser.ts` - Summary section parsing

### Schema
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema

### Test Files
- `/test-improvements.ts` - Test utilities
- `/tests/verify-feature-02I.ts` - Verification script

## Database Management

### Creating Backups
After successful implementation and testing, backups were created:

```bash
# Create backups directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p backups

# Create phase1 backup after parsing
../scripts/db/backupdb.sh phase1

# Create phase2 backup after event processing
../scripts/db/backupdb.sh phase2
```

### Backup Files Created
- `backups/judicial_transcripts_phase1.sql` (6.0MB) - Contains parsed transcript structure
- `backups/judicial_transcripts_phase2.sql` (9.9MB) - Contains phase1 + event processing

### Restoring from Backups
```bash
# Restore to phase1 state
../scripts/db/restoredb.sh phase1

# Restore to phase2 state
../scripts/db/restoredb.sh phase2
```

## Running the Phases

### Phase 1 - Transcript Parsing
```bash
# Reset database
npx prisma db push --force-reset

# Load seed data
npm run seed

# Run phase1 with configuration
npm run parse:phase1 -- parse -c config/example-trial-config-mac.json --phase1
```

### Phase 2 - Event Processing
```bash
# Run phase2 (requires phase1 to be complete)
npm run parse -- parse --phase2 -c config/example-trial-config-mac.json
```

**Note**: The command syntax is awkward and should be refactored:
- `parse:phase1` script name with `--phase2` flag is confusing
- Consider renaming to clearer commands like `npm run phase1` and `npm run phase2`

## Verification

### Test Script
A verification script was created at `/tests/verify-feature-02I.ts` to validate:
- Field renaming completed successfully
- All pages have proper headers
- No duplicate pages exist
- Page numbering is continuous across sessions
- SessionSections are properly classified

### Run Verification
```bash
npx ts-node tests/verify-feature-02I.ts
```

## Results

### Pages
- ✅ All pages now have `parsedTrialPage` field (renamed from `parsedTrialLine`)
- ✅ Page 2 is properly created in summary sections
- ✅ No duplicate page 3
- ✅ CERTIFICATION pages have complete header information
- ✅ Continuous page numbering across sessions (1-125, 126-282, 283-406, etc.)

### SessionSections
- ✅ COURT_AND_DIVISION sections contain only court information
- ✅ CASE_TITLE section starts with party names
- ✅ New TRANSCRIPT_INFO section for transcript metadata
- ✅ APPEARANCES sections contain all attorney and law firm information
- ✅ No duplicate sections

### Statistics (for test trial)
- 12 sessions processed
- 1,530 pages with headers
- 9 section types per summary
- 16 witnesses identified
- 39 jurors created

## Future Improvements

1. **Command Line Interface**
   - Simplify phase execution commands
   - Make phase1/phase2 more intuitive
   - Consider single command with phase parameter

2. **Configuration**
   - All phase commands should use configuration file
   - Remove need for additional parameters

3. **Transcript Variations**
   - Current implementation handles Vocalife format
   - May need adjustments for other transcript formats
   - Consider making header patterns configurable

## Conclusion

Feature-02I successfully addressed all identified issues with page parsing and section boundaries. The system now correctly:
- Parses all pages including those within summary sections
- Maintains continuous page numbering across sessions
- Properly classifies all summary section content
- Has database backups for quick restoration to known good states

The implementation is ready for further testing with different transcript formats and variations.
