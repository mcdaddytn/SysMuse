02:26:19   15              MR. FABRICANT:   Thank you.

02:26:19   16              THE COURT:   You may proceed when you're ready.

02:26:23   19              Welcome to the members of the jury.        As you heard

02:26:30   20   this morning from Mr. Dacus during jury selection, my name

02:26:34   21   is Fred Fabricant.      I am not a Texan.     I am from the great

02:26:40   22   state of New York.

02:26:42   23              But I do spend a lot of time in Texas and spend a

02:26:46   24   lot of time in Marshall, Texas, working with Sam Baxter and

02:26:50   25   Jennifer Truelove, and many other attorneys in this

02:26:52    1   district.    And I've been coming here for nearly 20 years

02:26:56    2   working on patent cases in this Eastern District of Texas.

02:26:58    3              Just let me tell you a little bit about myself

02:27:00    4   because I didn't get to introduce myself.
