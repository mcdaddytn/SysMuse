Spin Control Multiple Spins

On any spin control, we should have multiple spins occur if the mouse button is held down over the up or down spin control.  Currently, we need to click the spin control over and over to increment a value, but we would like also to be able to click and hold over the up or down spin and get multiple increments at a reasonable speed (perhaps around 5 increments per second when spin held down if it is customizable otherwise if there is a standard rate with the control that should be OK).  If the rate of increment/decrement accelerates a bit with longer time held that is good too as the user if holding the button longer, probably wants it to move a greater distance.  The user will tend to switch to single clicks when getting close to desired value, so both modes should work seamlessly together.
