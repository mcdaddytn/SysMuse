# STATUS: Query Regression Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-01
**Session**: Query System Regression Investigation and Fix

## Issue Discovered

After running Phase 1-3 processing with the multi-pass parser on the Vocalife v Amazon trial, discovered that 48% of queries (23 out of 48) were returning zero results when they previously worked correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps
1. Checked witness examination data linking
2. Verified StatementEvent records existed with examination text
3. Compared working vs non-working query configurations
4. Identified trial name mismatch between database and query configs

### Root Cause
The multi-pass parser extracts a simplified trial name from the filename:
- **Database stored**: `"42 Vocalife Amazon"`
- **Queries expected**: `"VOCALIFE LLC, PLAINTIFF, VS. AMAZON.COM, INC. and AMAZON.COM LLC, DEFENDANTS."`

This mismatch caused queries filtering by `trialName` to return empty results.

## Solution Implemented

Updated 18 query configuration files to use the correct trial name:
- query-approach-bench.json
- query-attorney-multiple.json
- query-attorney-single.json
- query-cross-examination.json
- query-direct-examination.json
- query-enhanced-objections.json
- query-exhibit-handling.json
- query-judge-initiated.json
- query-judge-statements.json
- query-jury-instructions.json
- query-keywords-judge.json
- query-objections-analysis.json
- query-objections-detailed.json
- query-overruled-rulings.json
- query-strike-motion.json
- query-strike-variations.json
- query-top-witnesses.json
- query-witness-testimony.json

## Results After Fix

### Before Fix (Initial Run)
- Total Queries: 48
- Queries with matches: 25
- Queries with no matches: 23 (48%)
- Failed queries: 0

### After Fix
- Total Queries: 48
- Queries with matches: 42
- Queries with no matches: 6 (12.5%)
- Failed queries: 0

### Now Working
- ✅ Direct examination queries (22 matches)
- ✅ Cross examination queries (27 matches)
- ✅ Attorney-specific queries (7 matches for Hadden)
- ✅ Witness testimony queries (1336 matches)
- ✅ Judge statements queries (7 matches)
- ✅ Objections queries (44 matches for detailed)
- ✅ Strike motion queries (13 matches)
- ✅ Jury instruction queries (3 matches)
- ✅ Exhibit handling queries (1 match)

### Still Not Working (Different Issues)
These queries still return no matches but for different reasons:
1. **query-enhanced-court-directives.json** - May need different search terms
2. **query-enhanced-witness.json** - Configuration issue
3. **query-example-elasticsearch.json** - ElasticSearch proximity operators not working
4. **query-judge-by-session.json** - Session-specific filtering issue
5. **query-overruled-rulings.json** - May genuinely have no matches
6. **query-proximity-search.json** - ElasticSearch proximity feature not implemented

## Database State at Time of Fix

- Trial ID: 1 (Vocalife v Amazon, Case: 2:19-CV-00123-JRG)
- Sessions: 12
- Pages: 1,529
- Lines: 39,673
- Witnesses: 16 (22 after Phase 2)
- Markers: 146
- ElasticSearch Results: 510
- Court Directive Events: 125
- Witness Called Events: 56
- Statement Events: 6,334

## Lessons Learned

1. **Parser Consistency**: The multi-pass parser should ideally extract the full trial name from the transcript summary page, not just use the filename
2. **Configuration Management**: Query configurations should use more resilient identifiers (like caseNumber) rather than trial names
3. **Testing**: Need automated tests to verify queries work after parser changes
4. **Documentation**: This type of configuration dependency should be documented

## Next Steps

1. Consider updating multi-pass parser to extract full trial name from transcript
2. Update remaining queries to use caseNumber instead of trialName for better resilience
3. Investigate ElasticSearch proximity search implementation
4. Add query validation tests to prevent future regressions

## File Changes

All changes were made to files in `config/queries/` directory. Backup files with `.bak` extension were created for all modified files.
