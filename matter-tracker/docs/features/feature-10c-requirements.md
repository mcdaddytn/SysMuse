Report #2 (Medium Priority)
Matter Summary

Let's build a Matter Summary report that will show Matter name and description, task name and description, team member, projected hours and actual hours for any given timesheet period.  Let's add filter dropdowns next to date selection for Team Member and Matter, but they can default to blank (meaning include all).  If we select a single matter and/or team member, it should filter appropriately, and we should be able to remove the filters.

Report #3 (Low Priority)
Task Summary



Extra features for Report #1 (Medium Priority)

Implement a mouse-over popup on a given line of the report (for a given team member in the selected time period), that will show their full timesheet information.  Show each matter, task, projected, and actual hours when we mouse-over that particular team member in the summary report screen.

Extra features for Report #1 (Low Priority)

Also implement an export to csv feature that will export the report with the current sort settings.  It should bring up a dialog to save the csv to disk
