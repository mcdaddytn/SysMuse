03:44:50    3              THE COURT:   You have one minute remaining.

03:44:51    4              MR. RE:   And that's the main point.       The patent

03:44:54    5   wouldn't have been allowed.      The applicant knew about it.

03:44:57    6   The applicant is a very sophisticated applicant.           The

03:45:00    7   applicants had several patent lawyers.         He fired a patent

03:45:04    8   lawyer for not keeping him abreast of what's going on.

03:45:08    9              The privilege log showed he received each and

03:45:11   10   every amendment, each and every argument.         He participated

03:45:14   11   in the prosecution.

03:45:15   12              His language is very good.     He's very

03:45:19   13   knowledgeable, has dozens of patent applications, many

03:45:24   14   filed many, many years earlier than the dates we're talking

03:45:26   15   about here.

03:45:27   16              He knows about the publication system.        He knows

03:45:30   17   about prior art.     He knows about the different kinds of

03:45:33   18   patents.    And he had Kenyon & Kenyon, one of the most

03:45:37   19   sophisticated patent firms in the country at the time.

03:45:40   20   They no longer exist.     But he's very knowledgeable, and

03:45:44   21   dealt with his patent lawyer all the time.

03:45:46   22              And we cut a deal in this case to exchange any

03:45:51   23   transmittals of prior art being exchanged between the --

03:45:51   24   the lawyer and Dr. Li --

03:45:52   25              THE COURT:   Mr. Re, your time is up.       Take one or

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 341 Filed 10/09/20 Page 120 of 136 PageID #: 19915
                                                                                   1513



03:45:55    1   two more sentences and finish for me.

03:45:58    2           MR. RE:    And it shows he never gave Brandstein to

03:46:01    3   his lawyer, and he only gave Li, and Li was still not

03:46:06    4   disclosed.    Pretty good evidence.      I think it's plenty

03:46:14    5   reasonable to infer intent by Dr. Li, but particularly by

03:46:20    6   Mr. Tankha.

03:46:20    7           Thank you, Your Honor.

03:46:21    8           THE COURT:     Thank you.

03:46:21    9           Let me hear closing argument from Plaintiff.

03:46:23   10           MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:      Thank you, Your Honor.

03:46:31   11           So there are three specific issues here.

03:46:34   12           Issue one is Brandstein.        Defendant thinks that

03:46:38   13   the failure to disclose Brandstein within the body of the

03:46:41   14   non-provisional specification and removing it supposedly

03:46:45   15   from that specification is significant.
