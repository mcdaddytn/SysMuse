5                   Who's going to do the opening for Plaintiff?

6                   MR. HUESTON:      Good morning, Your Honor.         John

15                   (Jury in.)

16                   THE COURT:     Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

17      Please be seated.

18                   I'm going to welcome you back, ladies and gentlemen.

19      Thank you for being on time.          We're going to try to run the

20      trial along the timeline that I gave you during jury selection.

21                   But I now have some preliminary instructions I want

22      to give you before we start with the opening statements and

23      then get on to the evidence in the case.

24                   You've now been sworn as the jurors in this case, and

25      as the jury, you are the sole judges of the facts, and as such,
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 4 of 145 PageID #: 16515   4



1      you will determine and decide all the facts in this case.

2                   As the judge, I will give you instructions on the

3      law, I'll decide questions of law that arise during the trial,

4      including questions of evidence and procedure.               I'm also

5      responsible for managing the flow of the trial and maintaining

6      the decorum of the courtroom.

7                   At the end of the evidence, I'll give you detailed

8      instructions to apply in deciding this case.              And at that time,

9      I'll also give you a list of questions that you're then to

10      answer.     This list of questions is called the verdict form.

11      Your answers to those questions will need to be unanimous, and

12      those answers will constitute your verdict in this case.

13                   I now want to briefly tell you what the case is

14      about.    This case involves a dispute regarding certain United

15      States patents.       And I know that you've seen the patent film

16      that was played during jury selection, but I want to give you

17      some additional instructions here, now, and on the record about

18      a patent and how one is obtained.

19                   Patents are either granted or denied by the United

20      States Patent and Trademark Office, which you will most likely

21      hear referred to simply as the PTO.

22                   Patents -- a valid United States patent gives the

23      holder of that patent the right for up to 20 years from the

24      date the application is filed to prevent others from making,

25      using, offering to sell, or selling the patented invention
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 5 of 145 PageID #: 16516   5



1      within the United States or from importing it into the United

2      States without the patentholder's permission.               A patent is a

3      form of property called intellectual property, and like other

4      forms of property, a patent can be bought or sold.

5                   A violation of the patentholder's rights is called

6      infringement.      The patentholder may try to enforce a patent

7      against persons it believes to be infringers by filing a

8      lawsuit in federal court.         That's what we have in this case.

9                   The process of obtaining a patent is called patent

10      prosecution.      To obtain a patent, one must first file an

11      application with the PTO.         The PTO, the United States Patent

12      and Trademark Office, is an agency of the United States

13      Government that employs trained examiners to review patents or

14      patent applications.

15                   The application includes what is called a

16      specification.      The specification contains a written

17      description of the claimed invention telling what the invention

18      is, how it works, how to make it, and how to use it.

19                   The specification concludes or ends with one or more

20      numbered sentences.        These numbered sentences are the patent

21      claims.     When a patent is granted by the PTO, the claims define

22      the boundaries of its protection and give notice to the public

23      of those boundaries.

24                   Patent claims, ladies and gentlemen, may exist in two

25      forms.    They're referred to as either independent claims or
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 6 of 145 PageID #: 16517   6



1      dependent claims.

2                   An independent claim does not refer to any other

3      claim in the patent.        It is independent.       It's not necessary to

4      look at any other claim to determine what an independent claim

5      covers.

6                   However, a dependent claim refers to at least one

7      other claim in the patent.          A dependent claim includes each of

8      the elements or limitations of that other claim or claims to

9      which it refers, as well as the additional elements or

10      limitations within the dependent claim itself.

11                   Therefore, to determine what a dependent claim

12      covers, it's necessary to look at both the dependent claim

13      itself and the independent claim or claims from which it

14      refers, or as we say, from which it depends.

15                   The claims of the patents-in-suit in this case use

16      the word "comprising."         Comprising means including or

17      containing.      A claim that includes the word "comprising" is not

18      limited to the methods or devices having only the elements that

19      are recited in the claim but also covers methods or devices

20      that add additional elements.

21                   Take, for example, a claim that covers a table.                If

22      the claim recites a table comprising a tabletop, legs, and

23      glue, the claim will cover any table that contains these

24      structures, even if the table also contains other structures,

25      such as leaves to go in the top of the table or wheels to go on
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 7 of 145 PageID #: 16518   7



1      the ends of the legs.

2                   Now, that's a very simple example using the word

3      "comprising" and what it means, but, in other words, it can

4      have other features in addition to those that are covered by

5      the patent.

6                   After the applicant files the application for a

7      patent with the PTO, an examiner reviews the application to

8      determine whether or not the claims are patentable, that is, to

9      say appropriate for patent protection, and whether or not the

10      specification adequately describes the invention claimed.

11                   In examining a patent application, the examiner

12      reviews certain information about the state of the technology

13      at the time the application was filed.             The PTO searches for

14      and reviews this type of information that is publicly available

15      or that is submitted by the applicant.             This type of

16      information is called prior art.

17                   The examiner reviews this prior art to determine

18      whether or not the invention is truly an advance over the state

19      of the art at the time.         Prior art is defined by law, and I'll

20      give you at a later time specific instructions as to what

21      constitutes prior art.

22                   However, in general, ladies and gentlemen, prior art

23      includes information that demonstrates the state of the

24      technology that existed before the claimed invention was made

25      or before the application for a patent was filed.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 8 of 145 PageID #: 16519   8



1                   A patent contains a list of certain prior art that

2      the examiner has considered.          The items on this list are called

3      the cited references.

4                   After the prior art search and examination of the

5      application, the examiner at the PTO informs the applicant in

6      writing of what the examiner has found and whether the examiner

7      considers any claim to be patentable and, thus, it would be

8      allowed.     This writing from the examiner is called an office

9      action.

10                   If the examiner rejects the claims, the applicant has

11      an opportunity to respond to the examiner to try to persuade

12      the examiner to allow the claims.           The applicant also has a

13      chance to change or amend the claims or submit new claims.

14                   This process may go back and forth between the

15      examiner and the applicant for some time until the examiner is

16      satisfied that the application meets the requirements for a

17      patent, and in that case, the application issues as a United

18      States patent, or in the alternative, if the examiner

19      ultimately concludes that the application should be rejected,

20      then no patent is issued.

21                   Sometimes patents are issued after appeals within the

22      PTO or to a court.       The papers generated during these

23      communications back and forth between the examiner and the

24      applicant are called the prosecution history.

25                   The fact that the PTO grants a patent does not
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 9 of 145 PageID #: 16520   9



1      necessarily mean that any invention claimed in the patent, in

2      fact, deserves the protection of a patent.              While the issued

3      patent is presumed valid under the law, a person accused of

4      infringement has the right to argue here in federal court that

5      the claimed invention in a patent is invalid.

6                   It's your job as the jury to consider the evidence

7      presented by the parties and determine independently and for

8      yourselves whether or not the Defendant has proven that the

9      patent is invalid.

10                   To help you follow the evidence, I'm now going to

11      give you a brief summary of the position of the parties.

12                   The party who brings the lawsuit, as you know, is

13      called the Plaintiff.        The Plaintiff in this case is Core

14      Wireless S.a.r.l., who will simply be referred to during the

15      trial as the Plaintiff, or for short, as Core Wireless.

16                   The party against whom the suit is brought, as you

17      also know, is called the Defendant.            In this action, the

18      Defendants are LG Electronics, Inc., and LG Electronics

19      Mobilecomm U.S.A., Inc., who will be referred to collectively

20      through the trial simply as the Defendants or as LG.

21                   Now, as I told you during jury selection, this is a

22      case of alleged patent infringement.            There are two patents at

23      issue in this case.        The first patent at issue in this case is

24      United States Patent No. 8,713,476.            And patents are commonly

25      referred to simply by their last three digits, so this first
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 10 of 145 PageID #: 16521 10



1       patent will be referred to throughout the trial simply as the

2       '476 patent.

3                   The second patent at issue in this case is United

4       States Patent No. 8,434,020, which will simply be referred to

5       as the '020 or the '020 patent.

6                   The '476 and the '020 patents may be referred to

7       as -- at various times through the trial as the patents-in-suit

8       or the asserted patents.         And these patents generally relate to

9       cell phone features or to the functionality of smartphones and

10      tablets.

11                  You'll have a complete copy of these patents in your

12      juror notebooks, which will be passed out to you in a few

13      moments.

14                  The Plaintiff in this case, Core Wireless -- Core

15      Wireless, contends that the Defendants in this case, LG, are

16      directly and indirectly infringing certain claims of the

17      patents-in-suit by importing, making, and selling products that

18      include their patented technology.           Core Wireless also contends

19      that it is entitled to money damages.

20                  LG denies that it is infringing the patents-in-suit

21      and contends that the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit

22      are invalid as either being anticipated by what is called the

23      prior art or as being obvious in light of such prior art.

24                  I'll give you more detailed instructions regarding

25      the meaning of these terms in a few minutes.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 11 of 145 PageID #: 16522 11



1                    LG also contends that Core Wireless is not entitled

2       to any money damages.

3                    Now, I know that there are new words and concepts

4       that have been thrown at you this morning and that were thrown

5       at you during jury selection.

6                    I'm going to define a lot of those words and concepts

7       for you as we go through these instructions.              The attorneys are

8       going to discuss them in their opening statements.                The

9       witnesses are going to help you, through their testimony, to

10      understand these words and concepts.

11                   So don't feel overwhelmed at this stage, ladies and

12      gentlemen.     It will all come together as we go through the

13      trial, I promise you.

14                   Your job in this case is to decide whether the

15      asserted claims of the patents-in-suit have been infringed and

16      whether the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid.

17      If you decide that any claim of the patents-in-suit has been

18      infringed by LG and is not invalid, then you'll need to decide

19      what amount of money damages are to be awarded to the

20      Plaintiff, Core Wireless, as compensation for such

21      infringement.

22                   Now, my job in this case is to handle the rulings on

23      the law, evidence and procedure, and to oversee the conduct of

24      the trial.     In determining the law, it's specifically my job to

25      determine the meaning of any claim language from within the
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 12 of 145 PageID #: 16523 12



1       asserted patents that needs interpretation.

2                   However, in this case, since I have not provided you

3       with specific definitions or meanings of any of the terms in

4       the asserted claims, you should apply the plain and ordinary

5       meanings to those terms.

6                   In deciding the issues that are before you, you'll be

7       asked to consider specific legal rules, and I'll give you an

8       overview of those rules now and then again at the conclusion of

9       the case.     And at the end of the case, I'll give you further

10      detailed instructions.

11                  The first issue that you're going to be asked to

12      decide is whether LG has infringed any of the asserted claims

13      of the asserted patents.

14                  Infringement is assessed on a claim-by-claim basis,

15      and Core Wireless, the Plaintiff, must show by a preponderance

16      of the evidence that a claim has been infringed.               Therefore,

17      there may be infringement as to one claim but no infringement

18      as to another claim.

19                  There are also a few different ways that a patent can

20      be infringed, and I'll explain the requirements for each of

21      these types of infringement to you in detail at the conclusion

22      of the case.

23                  But in general, LG may infringe the asserted patents

24      by making, using, selling, or offering for sale in the United

25      States or importing into the United States a product meeting
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 13 of 145 PageID #: 16524 13



1       all of the requirements of a claim of the asserted patents.

2       I'll provide you with more detailed instructions on

3       infringement at the conclusion of the trial.

4                   The second issue you're going to be asked to decide

5       is whether the asserted patents are invalid.              Validity is a

6       defense to infringement.         Therefore, even though the PTO has

7       allowed the asserted claims and even though a patent is

8       presumed to be valid, you, the jury, must decide whether those

9       claims are invalid after hearing the evidence presented during

10      this trial.

11                  You may find a patent claim to be invalid for a

12      number of reasons, including because it claims subject matter

13      that is not new or it is obvious.

14                  For a patent claim to be invalid because it is not

15      new, LG, the Defendant, must show by clear and convincing

16      evidence that all of the elements of a claim are sufficiently

17      described in a single previous printed publication or patent.

18      We call these items prior art.

19                  If a claim is not new, it is said to be anticipated.

20      Another way that a claim can be found to be invalid is that it

21      may have been obvious.        Even though a claim is not anticipated

22      because every element of a claim is not shown or sufficiently

23      described in a single piece of prior art, the claim may still

24      be invalid if it would have been obvious to a person having

25      ordinary skill in the field of technology of the patent at the
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 14 of 145 PageID #: 16525 14



1       relevant time.

2                    You'll need to consider a number of questions in

3       deciding whether the invention claimed is -- in either of the

4       asserted patents is obvious.          And I'll provide you with more

5       detailed instructions on these questions at the conclusion of

6       the trial.

7                    If you decide that any claim of the patents-in-suit

8       has been infringed and is not invalid -- that is, the

9       presumption of validity has survived -- then you'll need to

10      decide what amount of money damages are to be awarded to Core

11      Wireless to compensate it for the infringement.

12                   A damage award must be adequate to compensate the

13      patentholder for the infringement, and in no event may the --

14      may the damage award be less than what the patentholder would

15      have received had it been paid a reasonable royalty for the use

16      of its patent.

17                   However, the damages you award, if any, are meant to

18      compensate the patentholder and are not meant to punish the

19      Defendant.

20                   You may not include in any damages award an

21      additional amount as a fine or penalty above what is necessary

22      to fully compensate the patentholder for the infringement.

23                   Moreover, damages may not be speculative, and the

24      Plaintiff, Core Wireless, must prove the amount of its damages

25      for the Defendant, LG's, alleged infringement by a
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 15 of 145 PageID #: 16526 15



1       preponderance of the evidence.

2                   I'll give you more detailed instructions on the

3       calculation of damages for LG's alleged infringement of the

4       patents-in-suit at the conclusion of the trial, including

5       giving you more specific instructions with regard to the

6       calculation of a reasonable royalty.

7                   However, the fact that I'm instructing you now on

8       damages does not mean that Core Wireless is or is not entitled

9       to recover damages.

10                  Now, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to be hearing

11      from a number of witnesses in this case.             And I want you to

12      keep an open mind while you're listening to the evidence and

13      not decide any of the facts until you've heard all of the

14      evidence.

15                  This is important.        While the witnesses are

16      testifying, remember that you will have to decide the degree of

17      credibility and believability to allocate to the witnesses and

18      the evidence.

19                  So while the witnesses are testifying, ladies and

20      gentlemen, you should be asking yourselves questions like

21      these:    Does the witness impress you as being truthful?

22                  Does he or she have a reason not to tell the truth?

23                  Does he or she have any personal interest in the

24      outcome of the case?

25                  Does the witness seem to have a good memory?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 16 of 145 PageID #: 16527 16



1                    Did he or she have an opportunity and ability to

2       observe accurately the things they've testified about?

3                    Did the witness appear to understand the questions

4       clearly and answer them directly?

5                    And, of course, does the witness's testimony differ

6       from the testimony of any other witness?             And if it does, how

7       does it differ?

8                    These are some of the kinds of things that you should

9       be thinking about while you're listening to each and every

10      witness during the trial.

11                   I also want to talk to you briefly about expert

12      witnesses.     When knowledge of a technical subject may be

13      helpful to the jury, a person who has special training and

14      experience in that particular field -- we refer to them as an

15      expert witness -- is permitted to testify to you about his or

16      her opinions on technical matters.

17                   However, you're not required to accept an expert's or

18      any other witness's opinions at all.            It's up to you to decide

19      whether do you believe an expert witness, or any witness for

20      that matter, and whether you believe they're correct or

21      incorrect and whether or not you want to believe what they have

22      to say.

23                   Now, I anticipate that there will be expert witnesses

24      testifying in support of each side in this case, but when that

25      happens, it will be up to you to listen to their
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 17 of 145 PageID #: 16528 17



1       qualifications.      And when they give an opinion and explain

2       their basis for it, you'll have to evaluate it and decide

3       whether you believe it and to what degree, if any, you want to

4       give it any weight or credibility.

5                    Remember, judging and evaluating the credibility and

6       believability of each and every witness is an important part of

7       your job as jurors.

8                    Now, during the trial, it's possible that some

9       testimony will come from one or more witnesses that are going

10      to be presented to you through what we call a deposition.

11                   In trials such as this, it's very tough, if not

12      impossible, to get every witness here in person at the same

13      time.    So the lawyers for each side, prior to the trial, take

14      the depositions of the witnesses.

15                   In a deposition, a court reporter is present, the

16      witness is placed under oath, just as if he or she were in open

17      court, and the parties ask them questions, and their answers to

18      those questions are recorded.

19                   Portions of the video recordings of those questions

20      and answers from the deposition may be played to you as a part

21      of this trial so that you can see the witness and hear their

22      testimony, even though they're not physically present in the

23      courtroom.

24                   That deposition testimony is entitled to the same

25      consideration insofar as possible and is to be judged as to the
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 18 of 145 PageID #: 16529 18



1       credibility, weight, and otherwise considered by the jury in

2       the same way as if the witness had been present in court and

3       given their testimony from the witness stand in front of you.

4                   Also, during the trial, ladies and gentlemen, it's

5       possible the lawyers are going to make certain objections, and

6       when they do, I'll make rulings on those objections.                It's the

7       duty of an attorney for each side of the case to object when

8       the other side offers testimony or other evidence which the

9       attorney believes is not proper under the rules of the Court or

10      the rules of evidence.

11                  Upon allowing the testimony or other evidence to be

12      introduced over the objection of an attorney, the Court does

13      not, unless express -- expressly stated, indicate an opinion as

14      to the weight or effect of such evidence.             As I said before,

15      you, the jury, are the sole judges of the credibility and

16      believability of all the witnesses and the weight and effect to

17      give to all of the evidence.

18                  Now, in this case, I want to compliment the parties,

19      because prior to today, both sides have worked very diligently

20      to go through a lot of exhibits and other pieces of evidence

21      that will save you a lot of time during this trial.

22                  We've already had the process of offering exhibits

23      and hearing arguments on their admissibility and obtaining

24      rulings on those arguments so that you will not have to sit

25      there and listen to all that during the trial.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 19 of 145 PageID #: 16530 19



1                   That means that if the parties show you an exhibit in

2       this trial, it means it's already been ruled on as to its

3       admissibility, and they can ask you such questions as they wish

4       to place it in context.        But that -- the time of going through

5       those arguments on admissibility has already been taken up and

6       taken care of so that you won't have to listen to that today or

7       during this week.

8                   Both sides have worked hard to streamline the issues

9       and to save all of us time during the trial, and they're

10      entitled to be complimented for that.

11                  However, all that being said, it is still possible

12      that objections may arise during the trial.              If I sustain an

13      objection to a question addressed to a witness, then you must

14      disregard the question entirely, and you may draw no inference

15      from its wordings nor may you speculate about what the witness

16      would have said if I had permitted them to answer the question.

17                  On the other hand, if I overrule an objection to a

18      question posed to a witness, then you should consider the

19      question and the answer just as if no objection had been made.

20                  You should know, ladies and gentlemen, the law of the

21      United States permits a judge to comment to the jury regarding

22      the evidence in the case, but those comments from the judge on

23      the evidence are only an expression of the judge's opinion and

24      may be disregarded by the jury entirely because, I remind you

25      again, you, the jury, are the sole judges of the facts in this
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 20 of 145 PageID #: 16531 20



1       case.

2                   I also want you to know that even though the law may

3       permit me to comment on the evidence to you, as I indicated

4       during jury selection, I am going to try very hard throughout

5       this trial not to comment on any of the evidence and not to let

6       you know what I think about any of the witnesses or any of the

7       matters submitted to you during the trial.

8                   Now, Ms. Holmes, in front of me, our court reporter,

9       is taking down everything that is said in the courtroom during

10      the course of the trial.         But the transcript of what has been

11      said will not be ready in time for you to use during your

12      deliberations.

13                  The transcript of what is said, the written version,

14      is prepared in the event that there is an appeal from this

15      case -- this court to an appellate court, but you will have to

16      rely on your memories of the evidence in this case.                You will

17      not have the transcript of the testimony to rely on.

18                  In a moment, you're each going to be given a juror

19      notebook.     In the back of those notebooks, you'll find a legal

20      pad or blank pages from which you can take notes.               You'll,

21      also, in the front pocket find a pen to use.

22                  It's up to each of you on the jury to decide whether

23      or not you want to take notes during the trial, and if you do,

24      how detailed you want your notes to be.             But remember, your

25      notes, if you decide to take them, are for your own personal
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 21 of 145 PageID #: 16532 21



1       use.    You're going to have to rely on your memory of the

2       evidence.

3                   And that's why you should pay close attention to the

4       testimony of each witness.         You should not abandon your own

5       recollection of the evidence just because someone else's notes

6       indicate something differently.           Your notes are to refresh your

7       recollection, and that's the only reason you should be keeping

8       them.

9                   At this time, I'm going to ask Mr. McAteer, our Court

10      Security Officer, to hand out the juror notebooks to the

11      members of the jury.

12                  (Pause in proceedings.)

13                  THE COURT:      In these notebooks, ladies and gentlemen,

14      you'll see that you each have a copy of the two asserted

15      patents that we've talked about.

16                  You'll also find in there a section for witnesses,

17      and you should have a single page for each possible witness

18      with a photograph of the witness at the top of each page and

19      their name underneath the photograph.            The remainder of those

20      pages are just ruled lines that you can take notes on if you

21      wish to.

22                  Also, in the back, as I mentioned, you should find a

23      legal pad or blank pages on which you can take notes and a pen

24      in there somewhere that you can use to take those notes if you

25      decide to do that.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 22 of 145 PageID #: 16533 22



1                    Those juror notebooks should either be in your

2       possession when you're in the courtroom or they should be on

3       the table in the jury room when you leave each day to go home.

4       They should not be left anywhere else but either in your

5       possession or on the table in the jury room.

6                    Now, that being said, there may be times during the

7       trial that we take a very brief recess when you're only going

8       to be out of the jury box for a matter of a few minutes, in

9       which case I may tell you it's all right to leave your juror

10      notebooks in your chairs.

11                   But unless I tell you that, they should either be in

12      your possession, or during lunch or at the end of the day, they

13      should be left on the table in the jury room when you leave the

14      courtroom.

15                   Now, we're going to have opening statements in a few

16      minutes, and I want to give you a brief roadmap before then of

17      how this trial is going to be structured.

18                   After the opening statements, the Plaintiff, Core

19      Wireless, will present its evidence in support of its

20      contentions that some of the claims of the patents-in-suit have

21      been and continue to be infringed by LG, the Defendants.

22                   To prove infringement on any claim, Core Wireless

23      must persuade you that it is more likely true than not true

24      that LG has infringed that claim; that is, by a preponderance

25      of the evidence.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 23 of 145 PageID #: 16534 23



1                    After Core Wireless has put on its evidence and rests

2       its case, the Defendant, LG, will present its evidence that the

3       asserted claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid.                They'll

4       also put on evidence to respond to the evidence of the

5       Plaintiff.

6                    Now, to prove the invalidity of any claim, LG must

7       persuade you by clear and convincing evidence that the claim is

8       invalid.

9                    After Core Wireless -- excuse me -- after LG has put

10      on its evidence and rested its case, then the Plaintiff, Core

11      Wireless, will be given an opportunity to put on additional

12      evidence that LG's evidence that the claims are -- to address

13      the claims by LG that the patents-in-suit are invalid and to

14      offer any other rebuttal evidence regarding infringement and

15      damages.

16                   Now, when Core Wireless puts on its second round of

17      evidence, that is called the rebuttal case.              And that will be

18      the last presentation of evidence during the trial.

19                   After Core Wireless finishes its rebuttal evidence,

20      then I will give you final instructions on the law that applies

21      in this case and the lawyers in the case will present their

22      closing arguments.       My final instructions to you are often

23      called the Court's charge to the jury.

24                   Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want to repeat my

25      earlier instruction to you not to discuss this case at all with
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 24 of 145 PageID #: 16535 24



1       anyone, and including that -- included in that is not to

2       discuss the case among yourselves until the time that you

3       retire to deliberate after you've heard all the evidence, after

4       my final instructions, and after closing arguments of the

5       attorneys.

6                    Then you'll deliberate in the jury room after you

7       retire at my instruction.         At that time, it's your duty to

8       discuss the evidence with each other during your deliberations.

9                    But until that time, you must not discuss the case

10      among yourselves in any way, and you must not discuss the case

11      with any person or communicate in any way about the case.

12                   As I indicated during jury selection, your decisions

13      as to how to answer the questions in the verdict form must be

14      based sole -- based solely and only on the evidence that you

15      hear during the trial, under oath, from the witness stand or

16      the exhibits that are admitted into evidence by the Court and

17      that have been scrutinized for admissibility prior to the

18      beginning of the trial.

19                   I'd also like to remind you of something that I also

20      mentioned during jury selection, and that is to leave your cell

21      phones either at home or in your vehicles.             That was to avoid a

22      disruption that might occur if they accidentally rang or

23      sounded during the trial.         And the same instruction applies to

24      the attorneys and the other persons in the courtroom.

25                   However, I want to add that this case deals with cell
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 25 of 145 PageID #: 16536 25



1       phones and how they work.         So you should not do any

2       investigation with your own cell phones or anyone else's cell

3       phones about anything you hear during the trial.

4                    Your cell phones and the cell phones of any other

5       person you're shown anywhere outside of this courtroom are not

6       evidence in this case, and they're not relevant to the issues

7       that you're to decide.

8                    Again, it's critical that your decisions as to the

9       facts in this case and how you answer the questions in the

10      verdict form are based only on the evidence that comes in on

11      the witness stand and is subject to cross-examination in open

12      court or the exhibits that I've admitted into evidence prior to

13      the trial beginning.        That should be the sole universe of the

14      evidence from which you answer the questions in the verdict

15      form.

16                   Any deviation from that calls into question and

17      jeopardizes all the work that's been done up until this point.

18      That's why -- that's why that instruction is so important, and

19      as I told you during jury selection, you're going to hear it

20      over and over again from me.          I promise you, you're going to be

21      tired of hearing about that by the time the trial is over.                     But

22      the reason I'm so repetitive with it is because it is so

23      important.

24                   I also want to remind you, as I did during jury

25      selection, that the attorneys, the witnesses, the party
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 26 of 145 PageID #: 16537 26



1       representatives in this case have been instructed not to talk

2       to you as you come and go from the courthouse, as you leave and

3       come from lunch, as you're on recess, or at any time.

4                   That's not that they're being rude or unfriendly;

5       it's so that the only information you have is what comes in

6       during the trial in the courtroom.

7                   So when that happens, when you pass one of these

8       lawyers on the steps coming in one morning or as you go out to

9       lunch and pass one of the witnesses, when they don't speak to

10      you, when they don't smile and -- and become engaging and open

11      a conversation with you, understand they're not being rude;

12      they're not being unfriendly; they're simply following the

13      Court's instructions to them.

14                  All right.      With those instructions, ladies and

15      gentlemen, we'll now proceed to hear opening statements from

16      the attorneys in the case.         We'll begin with the Plaintiff's

17      opening statement.

18                  Counsel, you may address the jury.

19                  MR. HUESTON:      Thank you, Your Honor.

20                  THE COURT:      Would you like a warning on your time?

21                  MR. HUESTON:      I would, Your Honor, at five minutes.

22                  THE COURT:      All right.     You may proceed when you're

23      ready.

24                  MR. HUESTON:      I'm ready to proceed, Your Honor.

25                  THE COURT:      You may proceed.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 27 of 145 PageID #: 16538 27



1                   MR. HUESTON:      Thank you.

2                   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.            This case is

3       about an inventor named Mathieu Martyn, and you're going to

4       meet him here today.        Here's a picture of him on the screen

5       before you.

6                   And this case is about his invention.             And it's about

7       the fact that LG has been using his invention and selling an

8       estimated 40 million cell phones to date, and they haven't been

9       paying a single penny for the use of that invention.                As jurors

10      in this case, you will have the right to require LG to pay

11      their fair share for using Mr. Martyn's invention.                And that's

12      what we're going to ask you to do.

13                  The story of this invention starts with the inventor

14      himself.    You're going to see Mr. Martyn, and you're going to

15      meet him today on the stand.          And you will learn that he grew

16      up in England, and he works there today.             And he's flown out

17      here to testify.

18                  He will tell you that he has dedicated his whole

19      career to making it easier for people to interact with machines

20      and electronic devices.        He works on things called user

21      interfaces, making it easier for people to use machines,

22      computers, and electronic devices.

23                  He'll tell you that this field of study really took

24      off in World War II.        During that time, ladies and gentlemen,

25      test pilots were trying new fighter aircraft, but the cockpit
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 28 of 145 PageID #: 16539 28



1       controls were so complicated that these pilots were crashing

2       and dying.

3                    Well, people who were experts in user interface got

4       together, studied those cockpits, and figured out ways to make

5       them work more easily, to be more intuitive for users, to make

6       it easier for humans to interact with them.              And they

7       succeeded.     They made the cockpit controls easier, and the test

8       pilots were no longer dying because of the cockpit controls.

9                    Mr. Martyn has worked in place after place making

10      user interfaces better.        You'll hear as one example him working

11      at British Airways.

12                   And there they had a computer kiosk set up, a desk

13      where people were supposed to get boarding passes.                But it was

14      confusing and hard to use.         He studied it and came up with a

15      solution that made it easy for people to interact with those

16      machines, get their boarding pass, and get right onto the

17      flight.

18                   By 1999, you will hear that Mr. Martyn worked at a

19      company called Symbian.        This is a very special company that

20      was actually established by a number of cell phone companies

21      around the world to try to make cell phones new and different,

22      to create a new and better cell phone.

23                   Mr. Martyn was very excited to be working there

24      because what he wanted to do was make cell phones work better

25      for people using those phones.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 29 of 145 PageID #: 16540 29



1                    He'll tell you that cell phones look a lot like the

2       one on the screen in front of you at that time.               They actually

3       had a lot of features and data in them.             They'd hold your

4       messages.     You'd be able to do a text message.            You'd be able

5       to look at your calls.        You'd be able to launch calls, lots of

6       things.

7                    But the problem was those features and data were

8       buried beneath layers of menus, and you had to punch a lot of

9       buttons to get there.        It was confusing and difficult.

10                   In fact, Mr. Martyn will walk through a demonstrative

11      with you -- this one right here -- where he'll show you that

12      just to look for your messages and then to create a new

13      message, it took many, many steps.

14                   You start at the menu.        You'd then push for the phone

15      book.     Then you had to find your messages, Step 3.             Then you

16      have to press again, go down to text messages.               Then you'd have

17      to select again, find the inbox and then go to new.                Then you

18      had to select again, find the inbox.            Then you had to press

19      open, and there finally, after seven steps, you'd see the

20      people who had been leaving you messages.

21                   And if you wanted to create a new message, it would

22      be even more steps.       You had to back out by pushing a different

23      button to the inbox.        You had to move again going up to write a

24      new message.      And then you had to select your recipient.

25      Already you're at 10 steps.         And you'll hear there were even
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 30 of 145 PageID #: 16541 30



1       more steps to find the recipient and then make a message and

2       then finally send a message.

3                   This, ladies and gentlemen, is an example of a bad

4       user interface.      It was confusing and difficult to use.

5                   Many of you may have had a TV remote control where

6       you're spending more time pushing the buttons on the remote

7       control than enjoying your movie or your entertainment device.

8       This is the problem that Mr. Martyn wanted to solve.

9                   Mr. Martyn, you will hear, spent day and night

10      thinking about a solution to this issue.             And then one day,

11      while he was riding a subway train, he had his eureka moment.

12      The idea came to him.        He figured out how to solve the problem.

13                  And you'll hear he can remember to this day because

14      it was one of those once in a lifetime things where he quite

15      clearly had a new idea and something that was groundbreaking.

16                  He went back to his company -- company, Symbian, and

17      told them about it, and they were very excited about it.                 But

18      you will hear that Mr. Martyn had to pass a number of tests.

19                  But, first, what was the idea of his invention?               He

20      came up with a way to bring all that critical, important

21      information about who's been calling you and a way to go ahead

22      and start writing a message or reply to an email right to the

23      top of the phone where, with just a single step, instead of

24      many steps, you could get right into it.

25                  It was called -- what he called it an application
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 31 of 145 PageID #: 16542 31



1       snapshot and lawyers later called the application summary

2       window.

3                    Here's an example of what it would look like right

4       next to the old way of doing things.            So the problem that he

5       solved was it took 10 steps to go into the inbox and see that

6       there were three unread messages and then to write a new email,

7       but now under his solution, with one step, you could get to

8       those emails and with one easy step that didn't get you

9       frustrated and was obvious and easy right from this main menu,

10      you could create a new message.           Problem solved.

11                   But here's the test that he had, ladies and

12      gentlemen.     First, he put himself through a test.            Even though

13      he had been working in cell phones for a long time and knew the

14      industry, he searched, he did Internet searches, he made sure

15      that there was nothing else out there that he had just come up

16      with.

17                   And then his company, Symbian, made sure that it was

18      a good invention.       They actually had at their company a patent

19      review board.      They actually encouraged employees to come up

20      with ideas.     But you'll hear that they rejected a lot of ideas,

21      they did their own research because they had to put their own

22      money behind potential new ideas.

23                   So you will hear that Mr. Martyn submitted his idea,

24      his invention to Symbian, the company, and they gave it the

25      thumbs up.     They hired a British patent lawyer to meet with
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 32 of 145 PageID #: 16543 32



1       him, and you'll hear the British patent lawyer filled out an

2       application and submitted it to the United Kingdom.                And later

3       there was an issued United Kingdom patent.

4                   But there was yet another test, and the most

5       important test, his invention was submitted to the U.S. Patent

6       Office.    And you will hear that the U.S. Patent Office studied

7       and reviewed his invention for 13 years before they issued two

8       related patents, the patents in this case, what we will be

9       calling the '020 and '476 patents.

10                  Now, you will hear that Symbian, the company, for

11      business reasons, moved on and took on other projects.

12      Mr. Martyn's invention and his team's projects were put on the

13      shelf.    But Mr. Martyn's invention was so ahead of its time, it

14      wouldn't stay on the shelf for long.            In fact, in just a few

15      years, Mr. Martyn started seeing his invention in phones,

16      including the LG phones.

17                  And you'll see, here's an example of an LG phone with

18      just the type of thing that Mr. Martyn had invented, the

19      summary of key information, like three new messages, and an

20      ability right at the top of the phone to launch right into a

21      function, like to reply to a message or make a call.

22                  Let's talk briefly -- you've heard a lot about it so

23      far, but briefly about what a patent is.             A patent is a piece

24      of property, just like a piece of land.             And just like you have

25      the right, if you own a piece of land, to lease it out, with a
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 33 of 145 PageID #: 16544 33



1       patent, you have the right to let others use it and to get a

2       license for the patent.        They pay you a fee to use it.           That's

3       your right.

4                   And just like if you own a piece of land, it's not

5       right for people to trespass on your piece of land, if you have

6       a patented invention, it's not right for people to use your

7       invention, to trespass on your invention.             And the legal word

8       that's used is "infringe" when people do that.

9                   And ladies and gentlemen, that's what we are bringing

10      to you today, LG's infringement to Mr. Martyn's invention.

11                  Now, you will see that the patents -- the idea of the

12      patent and the patent system is so important to the United

13      States, it's even protected in the U.S. Constitution at

14      Article 1, Section 8.

15                  And, ladies and gentlemen, the founding fathers

16      didn't just create any old patent system.             They wanted to make

17      sure that everybody, even the little guy, could get patents.

18                  They specifically rejected the idea that you had to

19      be able to make the thing you invented, because they realized

20      that only wealthy companies and individuals could get patents

21      that way.     They wanted to make it so that an inventor could

22      invent and get a patent.         Leave the manufacturing to others.

23                  And, ladies and gentlemen, they made it so that

24      patents could be bought and sold.           Just like a house can be

25      sold from a builder to a buyer to another buyer, patents can be
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 34 of 145 PageID #: 16545 34



1       sold as well from the inventor to a company to another company.

2                    You will hear that the patents in this case changed

3       hands a few times.       Symbian, which owned Mr. Martyn's

4       invention, sold it to Nokia, a cell phone company.                And later,

5       Microsoft had a financial interest in the patents, and these

6       patents were sold to Core Wireless, the Plaintiff here today.

7                    Now, Core Wireless is a small company.            You'll hear

8       they have a couple of offices, couple of very small offices,

9       one in Europe, one here in Texas.           And they have a related

10      company, something called a parent company, in Canada.                 You'll

11      also hear that LG has offices in many places, and they're a big

12      company, and they have a parent company, too, and it's in

13      Korea.

14                   But, ladies and gentlemen, this case is not about the

15      size of these companies and where they are and the offices.

16      And if you hear anybody trying to spend time on that and

17      focusing you on that, they're just trying to distract you.

18      This case is just about the two patents here and Mr. Martyn's

19      invention.

20                   Now, let me briefly tell you what Core Wireless has

21      paid for these two patents as part of a large group of 2,000

22      patents.     You will hear that they have paid and they are

23      obligated to pay a total of $36 million.

24                   This comes in three parts.         First, a very small

25      upfront payment of just $20,000 to get started.               Then they,
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 35 of 145 PageID #: 16546 35



1       through their deal with Nokia, had to pay and have paid

2       $14 million to maintain those patents and to prosecute them, to

3       move them along.

4                   And finally, ladies and gentlemen, they owe Nokia two

5       minimum payments, one this year for approximately $4 million

6       and one the next year for $14 million.            Adding all that up, the

7       cost for this portfolio of patents is a minimum of $36 million.

8                   But, ladies and gentlemen, you'll hear from Professor

9       Magee from the University of Texas in this case, and he'll tell

10      you about what these two patents are worth.              And that's the

11      focus for you in this case, not what the overall portfolio has

12      been brought for.

13                  Now, there's no dispute that Core Wireless didn't

14      make the invention here.         It's Mr. Martyn's invention.          And

15      there's no dispute that Core Wireless doesn't make cell phones.

16                  Now, LG may try to make an issue of it, but if they

17      do, you set that aside.        Don't fall for it.        Just because you

18      didn't build your own house doesn't mean you can't protect it.

19      Core Wireless, it's undisputed, owns these patents.                They have

20      the right to protect them.

21                  Now, in this case, ladies and gentlemen, there's

22      going to be overwhelming proof that LG infringed or trespassed

23      on Mr. Martyn's invention.

24                  You're going to hear from a Professor Ken Zeger, and

25      he's going to tell you he looked at 30 different cell phone
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 36 of 145 PageID #: 16547 36



1       types from LG, and he found in every single one of them the

2       application summary window in the patents.             He found -- and

3       there's the screen on the left -- the idea or invention of

4       Mr. Martyn in the LG cell phones.

5                   Now, Mr. Zeger will walk through the elements of

6       proving infringement, and I know it's a lot of legalese, but

7       I'm going to give you a taste for now how, in fact, LG has

8       infringed the patents here.

9                   And this is a claim -- a major claim in the case, and

10      there are a series of elements that have to be met, and you

11      will see in this trial that we easily meet the elements here

12      proving LG's infringement.

13                  THE COURT:      Counsel, speak up a little bit, please.

14                  MR. HUESTON:      Thank you, Your Honor.

15                  First, there needs to be a Computing Device with a

16      display screen.      Well, you will see that LG has a cell phone, a

17      computing device with a display screen.             We meet that first

18      element.

19                  Second element, the Computing Device being configured

20      to display on a screen a main menu listing at least a first

21      application.      You will see a device, and there on the main menu

22      at least one application.         We meet the second element.

23                  Then the third one, additionally, being configured --

24      this is a bit of a mouthful -- to display on the screen an

25      application summary window that can be reached directly from
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 37 of 145 PageID #: 16548 37



1       the main menu.

2                   Well, you'll see, just like you saw, that with the

3       swipe of a finger, the application summary window has reached

4       directly from the main menu.          That element is met.

5                   And next, wherein the application summary window

6       displays a limited list of at least one function offered in the

7       first application.       And, again, it's pretty simple.           There is

8       the application summary window, and, look, you can launch a

9       function reply right from it.          That's an example.       It meets the

10      element.

11                  And next, each function in the list being selectable

12      to launch the first application and initiate the selected

13      function.     Yes, that happens, again.         In that application

14      summary window, you can press and launch the application, and

15      there popping up in front of you is the reply email.                That

16      element is met.

17                  And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, I'm giving you

18      just some examples of the many ways that Mr. Martyn's invention

19      worked.

20                  Next element, wherein the application summary window

21      is displayed while the application is in an unlaunched state.

22      What does that mean?

23                  This was Mr. Martyn's invention that you could see

24      right up top the key information, like you got a message with

25      some text in it, and you could opt to reply to it without
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 38 of 145 PageID #: 16549 38



1       digging down into your applications.            That's exactly what you

2       could do here without launching anything.             So that element is

3       met.

4                   And the final one is the easiest, that there's a

5       computing device, and it's a mobile telephone.               And, yes, this

6       case is about LG's cell phones.           And so you will see that this

7       element is met as well.

8                   In fact, ladies and gentlemen, LG is not even going

9       to contest most of the infringement evidence in this case.                     In

10      fact, all they have are two-hands-in-the-cookie-jar excuses to

11      respond to this.

12                  The first one has to do with this element there,

13      application summary window that can be reached directly from

14      the main menu.      You will hear the inventor, Mr. Martyn, and the

15      expert say that's exactly what happens in the LG phone.                 Your

16      finger comes up from the main menu or home screen, and you're

17      there.    You meet the elements.

18                  So what did they say?         Their hand-in-the-cookie-jar

19      excuse is that the very top part here of the home screen -- I'm

20      trying to circle it there -- that doesn't count.               You should

21      slice that part of the home screen off and just call it --

22      consider it the status bar.

23                  It's -- they're going to say -- not part of the home

24      screen.    And because the window starts when you bring up the

25      application summary window, because you swipe starting there
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 39 of 145 PageID #: 16550 39



1       across the main menu, that somehow that doesn't count.

2                    Well, ladies and gentlemen, that doesn't work for

3       them.     There are two major problems with that position.              First,

4       it's simply not true.        We're going to show you LG documents

5       where LG tells consumers that the status bar is part of the

6       home screen.      It's not separate.       So the defense doesn't work

7       at all.

8                    And secondly, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to

9       hear that that defense doesn't matter anyway.              Why?    Because

10      with a single finger swipe right from the main menu or home

11      screen, you can get to the application summary window.                 And

12      that's just what the inventor had in mind, and that's just what

13      the patent describes.        So you can put that excuse aside.

14                   The second one is, in the summary window, while the

15      application is in an unlaunched state, so they're going to say

16      here, ladies and gentlemen, here's their -- here's their --

17      what they're going to try to say here is that somehow all the

18      applications are always launched, and so, therefore, this

19      element is not met.

20                   Well, ladies and gentlemen, take a look at the screen

21      before you.     To believe that, you're going to have to believe

22      that when you see on the left, if you missed a call from Joe

23      McGarry and you pushed to call him back and then your screen

24      lights up on the right with call in progress, big aqua blue

25      screen, the phone is on, they're going to have you believe that
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 40 of 145 PageID #: 16551 40



1       even though the phone is showing you that you've launched the

2       application, it isn't really launched at all.

3                    Ladies and gentlemen, that makes no common sense.

4       You are here to apply your common sense.             You can take that

5       excuse and set it aside.

6                    At the end of this case, you will see more than just

7       a preponderance of the evidence, but an overwhelming amount of

8       evidence that LG has, in fact, infringed all the elements here.

9                    Now, LG may actually try to blame Google here and

10      say:     Wait, they developed this Android software that has

11      Mr. Martyn's trespassing invention.            We're not to blame.

12                   Well, here, ladies and gentlemen, that -- that

13      doesn't get them off the hook.          If you take somebody else's

14      trespassing software and you put it in your cell phone and you

15      sell it, you're on the hook, too.           You've trespassed the

16      invention.

17                   Now, let's talk about invalidity.           LG here is going

18      to say that somehow the U.S. Patent Office has made a mistake,

19      not just once but twice with these patents.              This is what I

20      call the lawnmower defense.

21                   Let's say your neighbor steals your lawnmower, and

22      you catch them redhanded.         And you say:      Hey, what are you

23      doing?     Why did you do this?       And they say to you:        I didn't do

24      it.    But if I did, your lawnmower is broken.

25                   That's a form of what you're going to hear from LG on
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 41 of 145 PageID #: 16552 41



1       invalidity.     They're going to say:        We didn't infringe the

2       patents, but if we did, your patents are no good.

3                    Ladies and gentlemen, they have a big mountain to

4       climb on that because they have to show a lot of people were

5       wrong.     They got to show that Mr. Martyn was wrong when he

6       searched everything and thought about everything he knew about

7       cell phones, that the Symbian patent board was wrong when they

8       did their research and put their money behind it, that the

9       British patent lawyer was wrong when he went forward with the

10      application in the United Kingdom, and most importantly, that

11      the U.S. Patent Office was wrong not once but twice.

12                   You'll hear they had 13 years to consider these

13      patents.     And, in fact, you'll hear that they considered over

14      30 prior patents and technical articles.

15                   But LG is going to tell you:         Oh, that's not enough.

16      Well, take a hard look at what LG says everyone missed.                 You'll

17      see that there's nothing like Mr. Martyn's application summary

18      window where you have key data and the ability to launch and

19      move into functions right at the top of the phone.

20                   In fact, LG stretches so much that they'll show you

21      patents like this one, Mr. Blanchard's, which is the opposite

22      of what Mr. Martyn was trying to do.            You can see by looking at

23      this thing that it has menu after menu after menu.                This is

24      just the kind of thing that Mr. Martyn thought was a problem

25      and was trying to solve.         It doesn't work.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 42 of 145 PageID #: 16553 42



1                   And so, ladies and gentlemen, you will be asked to

2       consider what is the appropriate amount of money that LG should

3       pay for trespassing on Mr. Martyn's invention.

4                   Well, ladies and gentlemen, I will want you to start

5       with what LG itself knew the value of Mr. Martyn's invention to

6       be.   You will see -- and let's put it up, please,

7       Mr. Wietholter, Plaintiff's Exhibit 184 -- before this lawsuit

8       was filed, before LG had any incentive to say today:                We don't

9       value this and we don't infringe, internally, in their own

10      documents, they were talking about how important the types of

11      features were that Mr. Martyn had in his invention.

12                  This document here is produced after LG surveyed

13      hundreds of consumers about what they really wanted in their

14      cell phones.

15                  Let's go to the next slide, please.

16                  You'll see that they came up with five key insights

17      to present to their company as critical for consumer

18      acceptance.

19                  Next slide, please.

20                  One of them was -- you can see it there -- Eliminate

21      unnecessary work.       Consumers want to complete tasks in as few

22      steps as possible.

23                  That's what Mr. Martyn was doing, giving shortcuts to

24      get to data and functions.

25                  And the handset that is most organized and efficient
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 43 of 145 PageID #: 16554 43



1       will win the heart of the consumer.

2                   That's exactly what Mr. Martyn was trying to bring to

3       cell phones.

4                   Next slide.

5                   And then, in fact, their specific recommendation to

6       eliminate unnecessary work, look at Recommendation No. 1:

7       Provide innovative ways for easier access to core applications

8       and features.

9                   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Martyn couldn't better

10      summarize what his invention was doing.             These documents show

11      that LG itself knew the value of what Mr. Martyn was bringing

12      with his invention.       They knew that value, and they took that

13      invention and put it in their phones.            And they haven't paid a

14      penny for its use.

15                  Now, you will hear from Professor Magee from the

16      University of Texas, and he will talk to you about the value of

17      these two patents, and he will tell you about what is a

18      reasonable royalty that LG should pay for use of these patents?

19                  And he's going to tell you that that's about 10 cents

20      per phone that's been sold.         And he's going to tell you that's

21      reasonable because the phones -- as LG's own documents were

22      showing, the phones work better with the invention that

23      Mr. Martyn brought.

24                  THE COURT:      Five minutes remaining, Mr. Hueston.

25                  MR. HUESTON:      Thank you, Your Honor.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 44 of 145 PageID #: 16555 44



1                    Now, to be clear, we're not saying that LG hasn't

2       made other great inventions with their phone.              They've come up

3       with a nice-looking outer hard case, microprocessors, radio

4       antennas, a touchscreen.         There are other applications they

5       have for emails, calendars, web browsers, lots of good things

6       that LG has brought.

7                    But let's keep our focus in this case, ladies and

8       gentlemen.     We're talking about their use of Mr. Martyn's

9       invention, the specific application summary window which comes

10      up in all their LG phones.         That's what we're talking about

11      here.

12                   And Professor Magee will tell you that by that

13      10 cents per phone, LG's still going to be able to keep

14      99 percent of their profits.

15                   Now, you may hear LG try to talk about how, well, if

16      all the patents in this phone were worth 10 cents, what --

17      where would we be then?        Well, ladies and gentlemen, there's

18      going to be no evidence in this case that all the patents in

19      the phone are worth 10 cents.          That's a distraction.        Put it

20      aside.     Your focus is on the invention here and just these two

21      patents.

22                   Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude with this:

23      Just like strangers are not allowed to trespass into your

24      property and on your land, LG is not allowed to use

25      Mr. Martyn's invention without paying its fair share.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 45 of 145 PageID #: 16556 45



1                    And that's just what LG is doing.           They knew and know

2       the value of what he brought with his invention, and they're

3       using it for free without paying what they should.

4                    This is your chance to vindicate patent rights.              At

5       the end of this case, we'll have a chance to talk to you again,

6       and we'll ask at that time that you give credit where credit is

7       due.

8                    Thank you.

9                    THE COURT:     All right.     Defendants may now present

10      their opening statement.

11                   MR. HARRIS:     Thank you, Your Honor.

12                   THE COURT:     Would you like a warning on your time,

13      Mr. Harris?

14                   MR. HARRIS:     I would, Your Honor.        Five minutes, if

15      you would.

16                   THE COURT:     That will be fine.

17                   MR. HARRIS:     Thank you.

18                   THE COURT:     Proceed when you're ready.

19                   MR. HARRIS:     Thank you, Your Honor.        I'd like to

20      proceed.

21                   May it please the Court.

22                   Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Richard Harris, and

23      with me is several attorneys who, with me, represent -- have

24      the privilege of representing LG.

25                   Mr. Nafei, the senior vice president of LG, is
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 46 of 145 PageID #: 16557 46



1       joining us at the tables, as are several representatives for LG

2       in the courtroom.

3                    This is a very important case to them, and they've

4       waited a long time to be able to present this case to you for

5       your consideration.

6                    Now, the case is actually very simple, very

7       straightforward.       This is a case about an idea that someone

8       came up with 16 years ago, Mr. Martyn.

9                    And contrary to the way it's been portrayed to you,

10      that idea was not shelved for a period of time.               That idea was

11      in the inventor's own words, canned, killed, the entire project

12      was gutted, it was let go, and nothing further was done.

13                   Nothing further was done, ladies and gentlemen, to

14      the extent that not one other phone company anywhere, including

15      the phone companies for which that idea was created, including

16      Nokia, who, by the way, is out of business today.               Used to be

17      one of the biggest phone companies in the world, phone

18      manufactures.      They don't make phones anymore.           They do other

19      things.

20                   No other phone company in the world ever used the

21      idea, not the ones it was intended for and not any other

22      company, including LG.        LG does not infringe those -- those --

23      that idea.     It was killed.

24                   Now, what we want to do is give you some context,

25      some relevance with regard to what the purpose of that idea was
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 47 of 145 PageID #: 16558 47



1       and why it was around.

2                   Your Honor, if I may go back to counsel table for a

3       second?

4                   THE COURT:      You may.

5                   MR. HARRIS:      Thank you.

6                   Now, ladies and gentlemen, you saw an old phone in

7       some of the slides that Plaintiff's counsel was showing you.

8       Those phones used to be called candy bar phones because they

9       were the size a candy bar.         And I've got another one here.              I

10      hope you can see it.        Small phones.

11                  The one thing that those phones all had in common is

12      that they had a very small display screen.             And as you saw on

13      Mr. Hueston's screen, you could only fit four or five lines of

14      text in it.     And because of that limitation, it was difficult

15      to operate the menu.

16                  You used to have to hit one line and then wait for

17      three more to come up, then hit a line.             And it may take you

18      two or three -- not always seven, but two or three efforts to

19      get where you wanted to go.

20                  The idea there is expressed in the patent.              In fact,

21      it's in the notebook that you were given.             If you look -- and

22      by the way, the patents are arranged by column and line number.

23      And there will be references to it throughout.

24                  But in the copies that you've got, in both the '020

25      patent and the '476 patent, you'll see in Column 1, Line 25,
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 48 of 145 PageID #: 16559 48



1       under the title background of the invention, you will see right

2       from the get-go the -- the problem with phones today is the

3       screens are too small, and you have to punch one, punch it

4       again, punch it again.

5                   You may recall, ladies and gentlemen, that in the old

6       days, if you wanted to send a text message, you might have to

7       hit a key three times or four times to go from the P to the Q,

8       the Q to the R, and the R to the S.            Well, that was the

9       problem.    Those were the phones back then.

10                  Now, around that time in 2000 when this idea first

11      arose and then was put away, killed, canned, in the inventor's

12      own words, phones were starting to get larger screens.                 You're

13      going to see some.

14                  In today's day and age, this is what the accused

15      product looks like.       In comparison, the background, the need,

16      the necessity, the purpose, the importance simply isn't there.

17      That's not -- it's not relevant to the operation of a phone

18      now.   It's simply not there.

19                  There's something else that Mr. Hueston didn't go

20      into that I wanted to address, which the Court did go into.

21      The Court, if you recall, in that videotape that you watched

22      when the jury was being impaneled, talked about what goes on

23      when -- when you prosecute a patent application.

24                  You file an application.         You get back a response.

25      On occasion, you may narrow that application.              You may add
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 49 of 145 PageID #: 16560 49



1       requirements to get around prior art that the examiner is

2       citing.    And it's a process that goes back and forth until,

3       ultimately, if there is a patentable subject matter, perhaps a

4       patent will issue.

5                    And if there's not patentable subject matter, a

6       patent will not issue.        But there's that process, the give and

7       take that makes up what the Court referred to as the

8       prosecution history.

9                    Now, you're going to see prosecution histories in

10      this case.     And one of the things you're going to see is that

11      along the way, in prosecuting these two patents, and for all

12      intents and purposes, ladies and gentlemen, these patents are

13      identical.     They have the same specification.           The only thing

14      that's different is the claims.

15                   All right.     In the claims, things had to be added in

16      both of these patents, which Mr. Hueston neglected to mention.

17      And what was added were key words.

18                   Now, the original applications didn't have these

19      words in it, and that, you'll learn from the Court, is

20      significant.      It's significant because, if you had to add the

21      words to distinguish this invention over the prior art, oh,

22      those words are very important.           You can't have something close

23      or near.     You've got to have exactly what those words are

24      requiring.

25                   And during the prosecution of the patent applications
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 50 of 145 PageID #: 16561 50



1       for the '020 and the '476, two very important things had to be

2       added to distinguish this invention, to make it patentable over

3       the references, the old patents, the old publications, what was

4       called the prior art as described by the Court to you.                 Two

5       things had to be added.

6                   Number one, there has to be an application summary

7       window that could be reached -- it says right there, that can

8       be reached directly from the main menu.

9                   It doesn't say that can be reached from the main menu

10      or that simply can be reached.          It requires that the

11      application summary window be reached directly from the main

12      menu.    And that's because amongst the prior art references,

13      there were references that suggested you could reach it

14      indirectly or from somewhere else.

15                  So this claim was narrowed during this prosecution

16      history to require that for a response, and the response is the

17      whole test here, does it infringe?           Does it not infringe?

18                  You've got to have that particular requirement.                  It

19      narrowed the claims.        That was the territorial fence post that

20      was narrowed, that was minimized, decreased to get the patent.

21      That was one item.

22                  There was also another item that was added along the

23      way, even later.       The people prosecuting the patent application

24      added the words that the application summary window is

25      displayed while the application is in an unlaunched state.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 51 of 145 PageID #: 16562 51



1       That's very important.

2                    Ladies and gentlemen, back in the year 2000, phones

3       like this, these candy bar phones, were telephones that had

4       evolved since the '80s when cellular communications came into

5       being.    They evolved from the old bag phone that you used to

6       put in your car from the old brick phone that you used to walk

7       around with that looked like a walkie-talkie from World War II.

8       It evolved, and it got good and small.

9                    Those were phones that as technology advanced,

10      companies that were making these attempted to add features that

11      computers had so that you could have applications; you could

12      text; you could send an email; you could do things that a

13      computer does.      This is a phone with a few computer-like

14      functions.

15                   On the other hand, today's phones, looking at

16      context, looking at relevance, today's phones are computers on

17      which you can make a phone call.           That's a huge, huge

18      distinction.

19                   The fact is, I looked into it.          These phones are nine

20      times faster, memory, battery capacity, with a display, nine

21      times more powerful than a computer, a standard PC, a desktop

22      computer from the year 2000.          This is a computer with which you

23      can make a phone call.

24                   Now, we're going to be going through with the expert

25      witnesses in this case and we're going to be looking at the
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 52 of 145 PageID #: 16563 52



1       evolution of that claim, because when you get your instruction

2       from the Court, again, as you already heard twice now from the

3       video before you were impaneled and with the Court's

4       instructions before the opening statements, you're going to

5       see, you're going to realize, you're going to be able to feel

6       the importance of the claim and be able to look at the products

7       and compare -- compare them to the claims.             That's going to be

8       very important.

9                   And when you do, we believe you'll come to the

10      conclusion that the accused LG product, the accused phone that

11      I was just holding up, a picture of which is on your screen,

12      cannot infringe, does not infringe.

13                  Now, back to context.         The importance, the relevance

14      to patents, there are patents that we have seen throughout

15      history that have been very important, very relevant.

16                  On your screen is a copy of Thomas Edison's lightbulb

17      patent.     Also is a copy of the Wright brothers patent on the

18      airplane.     Those are significant.        Those are iconic patents in

19      history along the way.        Sure, they expired years ago, but those

20      were important.      They were useful.       They were relevant.

21                  Now, the patents we're looking at here, the '020 and

22      '476, in the context of cellular communication, the patents

23      that were permitted to lay on the floor, cutting room floor,

24      canned expressly by Symbian, who stopped the project, those are

25      less relevant, less useful.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 53 of 145 PageID #: 16564 53



1                   Just as today coming up with a -- a way of saving

2       your -- your film from your camera to make it easier to go to

3       your pharmacy to get your film developed, well, you may get a

4       patent on it, but it certainly isn't all that useful because

5       people don't get film developed anymore at the pharmacy.

6                   People are using, ironically, these to take pictures.

7       They're using these to give you directions to go from one

8       location to another location and telling you along the way when

9       to take a turn and which direction to take that turn.                This is

10      a computer.

11                  Now, I mentioned the fact that this is 16-year-old

12      technology.     Mr. Hueston touched on it as well.            The original

13      application was filed in the UK, in England, in July of 2000.

14      Mr. Hueston didn't really go through the drawings so much of

15      the patent as he did the overlays on his phone.               But the patent

16      drawings now is what I'd like to go through with you.

17                  If you look at the patent drawings, as you will --

18      it's in your -- it's in your folders.            If you look at the

19      patent drawings, you'll see Figure 1 shows what used to be on

20      the screen of these candy bar phones back in the year 2000.                    It

21      shows the words "launcher," and then below that "messages,"

22      "context," "calendar," "phone."

23                  Now, in the patents themselves, it uses the word

24      "main listing."      It's only when you get to the claims -- when

25      they prosecuted the claims, that they sort of changed the words
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 54 of 145 PageID #: 16565 54



1       "main listing" to "main menu."

2                    "Main menu" is a very important term in this case.

3       And while Mr. Hueston was looking at his phone, instead of the

4       drawings, he referred to the entire screen as the main menu or

5       the main listing.       It's not.     In fact, not only did the

6       inventor, Mr. Martyn, describe why he was doing this because of

7       the size of the display, he also described what makes up the

8       main menu.

9                    If you go to Column 4, Lines 30 and 31, you'll see

10      that he helped define -- for anyone reading this patent, for

11      anyone looking at the prosecution history, he told them what's

12      the main menu.      And what he told them the main menu was, was

13      all the language on the screen between the word "launcher" at

14      the top and the word "phone" at the bottom.              That's the main

15      menu.

16                   He did not include the Figure 1 at the bottom.              That

17      was not part of the main menu.          Heck, that's part of the

18      drawing from the patent application.            And he expressly excluded

19      that status bar at the top, which you see on almost all phones.

20                   Now, back in the year 2000, that status bar was

21      important for three purposes.          How much battery do I have?

22      What time is it?       And how good is my signal strength?           That's

23      what it was for.       That's all it was used for.

24                   Mr. Martyn made it clear, as well as his patent

25      attorneys, that the main menu was only that which was in green.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 55 of 145 PageID #: 16566 55



1       And to use his invention, you would hover over one of the

2       applications on that main menu.

3                   You hover over it for, say, a minute-and-a-half --

4       excuse me -- a second-and-a-half.           Get my numbers right.        You'd

5       hover over it for a second-and-a-half or -- or click, and if

6       you wanted this application snapshot view, you would get it.

7                   Here I've bolded messages.          And, again, this is

8       Figure 2 from the '020 patent drawings.             That's the application

9       snapshot that Mr. Hueston was talking about and that Mr. Martyn

10      described in detail in his application.

11                  Now, that one shows create a message or enter chat

12      room.    You would get an upfront indication of what you could do

13      without having to open your app, without having to open the

14      application, because processors were slow back then.                Memories

15      were small.     Battery life was small.

16                  You didn't want to actually go in and open things up.

17      That was the purpose of the invention.            And it's in the '020,

18      and it's in the '476 patent.          That's what the purpose of the

19      invention was for.

20                  Now, that's the application summary window.

21                  And another version of it, if you had yet another

22      category of information that could pop up in that application

23      snapshot, again, you have to do it directly from the main menu

24      or the main listing as is described.

25                  It could open like that.         That's Figure 3.       These are
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 56 of 145 PageID #: 16567 56



1       the figures from the patent, as opposed to a phone that's being

2       shown that isn't described in the patent.

3                    Okay.   Now, Mr. Hueston touched on it, and it's true,

4       just as you have the right, after hearing the video from the

5       other Court, the other U.S. District Judge, just as you have

6       the right to look at your -- your invention as a deed of trust,

7       as property that you could -- you could work with, that you

8       could handle, that you have a right to own, there's something

9       else that goes with that particular deed of property, and that

10      is that when you go back and forth with the Patent Office and

11      you keep adding requirements to the claims, you make your

12      property fence posts smaller and smaller.

13                   All right.     The more information you add to a patent

14      claim, the narrower you make it, the smaller your deed of

15      property is.      And at the end of the day, once you're left with

16      what the Patent Office gives you in the way of a patent, you

17      can't then stretch that fence post to cover someone else's

18      property.

19                   That's not your property.         That's your neighbor's

20      property.     That's not your property.         That's LG's property.

21      That's a significant point.         There's the fence post.         Not to be

22      stretched.

23                   So let's take a look at the fence post and how they

24      operate in this patent.        Again, you have the fact that

25      Claim 1 -- and that's true for both the '020 and the '476
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 57 of 145 PageID #: 16568 57



1       patent -- both of them require an application summary window

2       that can be reached -- not just reached but reached directly

3       from the main menu.

4                    Now, we go back to the drawing.          We go back to

5       Figure 3.     And if you notice, there's another thing on Figure 3

6       that up until this point was not included by Mr. Martyn as part

7       of his invention.       You got that status bar at the top.            It's in

8       red.     It's flashing red.

9                    That was never considered part of the main menu

10      because the status bar was never contemplating as having any

11      role in this invention whatsoever.           The word "status bar"

12      doesn't even appear in the patent application.               Doesn't appear

13      in the patent.      I don't believe the word "hours," "battery," or

14      "signal strength" appear either.

15                   It requires that you access the snapshot directly

16      from the main menu, not some other portion.              Status bar is not

17      part of the main menu.

18                   Here's another phone.        Here's a picture of a Nokia

19      phone.     Unless you're going through eBay, you will not be able

20      to buy a Nokia phone so easily.           As I mentioned before, they're

21      out of business.       That was the company that worked in

22      partnership with Symbian to create the invention in the first

23      place, an invention they never used.

24                   All right.     If you notice on this particular candy

25      bar phone, it too has a status bar at the top, and next to it
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 58 of 145 PageID #: 16569 58



1       is the accused LG phone.         One is a phone with some limited

2       computer capabilities.        The other is a computer that happens to

3       make a phone call.

4                   The LG phone does, indeed, have a status bar, but

5       what it has here is an invention that was developed by Google

6       on its Android operating system, all the way back in 2008 and

7       2009, and that is a completely separate structure.                It's called

8       a notification panel, a notification drawer notification panel.

9                   And how that works is, is the status bar is the

10      handle, is the grip.        You take your finger, you completely

11      bypass the main menu, by the way.           You take your finger, you go

12      to the top, and you draw down over the main menu which

13      deactivates the main menu.

14                  And you get -- you don't get one snapshot of -- of a

15      particular application; you get everything, everything that's

16      gone on during the night and day during your phone, with all

17      your applications that you've set up to give you announcements.

18      You get announcements galore, you get notifications everywhere,

19      and you have an opportunity to open those up.

20                  That is not coming from any main menu.             That's a

21      notification drawer, and it was invented by Google, and it's

22      not in a Google patent, rather, it's in the Google operating

23      system which is free to LG and the other phone manufacturers

24      and everybody else in the world.

25                  It's free, so that people have an impetus, a desire
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 59 of 145 PageID #: 16570 59



1       to draw up new apps, new applications, and get them into

2       mainstream congress so that people can enjoy their phone even

3       more.

4                   What's in it for Google?         Plenty.     Google, once they

5       get you on an Android operating system phone, has an

6       opportunity to sell you Google Maps.            They have you use the

7       Google search engine, which they make money on, and other

8       things that's in Google's best interest.

9                   But the use of this Open Source operating system, the

10      Android system is absolutely free.           This was invented by

11      Google.    No one's blaming Google for it.           This is huge, huge

12      technology that's been used for years.

13                  Taking a look, again, this time in animation, you

14      see -- you see the hand bypass the main menu.              You see it draw

15      down the notification shade -- the notification panel, which

16      deactivates the main menu, at which point you've got all your

17      announcements.

18                  And, yes, some of them might give you an option to be

19      able to go directly to one or another location, but that's not

20      a main menu snapshot.        That's something else.        That's Google's

21      notification drawer.

22                  Now, this is what the notification drawing looks like

23      after it's completely deployed.           If you try to hit items, and

24      you can sort of see underneath some of the main menu items,

25      those will not work.        That's because the main menu has been
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 60 of 145 PageID #: 16571 60



1       deactivated.

2                   All right.      The accused summary window on one of your

3       notifications, that's on the notification drawer; that's not on

4       the main menu.

5                   The status bar is not the main menu.             And as -- as

6       proof of that, there are different screens on these computers

7       that you could make a phone call with.

8                   There's the main menu screen on your left.              There's

9       your contacts application after it.            There's your calendar

10      application after that.        There's your Gmail application on --

11      after that.     And there's your messaging application after that.

12                  And if you notice, the one consistent thing across

13      the board with all those applications -- and by the way, the

14      main menu is an application.          The one thing that's consistent

15      is the status bar always remains at the top.              The status bar is

16      not an application.       It's a user interface function.           That's

17      the one design and program with Google software.

18                  Across the board, it remains the same.             The color

19      changed because your application screen color changed, but it

20      remains the same across the board.

21                  The other thing that shows that the status bar and

22      the notification drawer has nothing to do with any of your

23      screens, be it the main menu screen or any other screen, is

24      look what happens no matter what screen you're at, as long as

25      that status bar is working.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 61 of 145 PageID #: 16572 61



1                   Watch what happens by looking at your screen.               You

2       can access your notification drawer from any screen because

3       you're not using the screens themselves.             You're using the

4       status bar as a handle for the notification drawer.

5                   Now, you're going to hear testimony from Dr. Sandler

6       who was in charge of the software engineers who developed this

7       user interface at Google.         He was asked:      Can a user navigate

8       to the notification shade by pulling down one finger as you

9       described before?

10                  He answered:      Yes, because the status bar is

11      available, and the user is actually interacting with the

12      summary window to do that.

13                  Home screen is -- that's a euphemism.             That's the

14      same words as main menu.

15                  THE COURT:      Five minutes -- five minutes remaining.

16                  MR. HARRIS:      Thank you, Your Honor.

17                  The home screen is uninvolved.

18                  Now, there's another requirement that was added, that

19      the application summary window be displayed while the

20      application is in an unlaunched state.            That was important

21      because there was prior art that showed summaries that would be

22      provided when the application is in a launched state.

23                  So the people prosecuting this patent application at

24      the Patent Office, the people going back and forth, they added

25      the fact that when you see the summary window pop up, it's got
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 62 of 145 PageID #: 16573 62



1       to be in a situation where your other applications are not

2       launched and running.

3                   Both of those features, the inability to access a --

4       any kind of a summary window directly from the main menu and

5       the nonexistence of an unlaunched state, both are missing, both

6       patents are not infringed.

7                   Now, you're going to hear from Dr. Rhyne, LG's

8       expert, that's going to tell you the significance of that

9       prosecution history.        He went through it.       He'll be testifying

10      on the fact that you cannot get from the main menu -- you

11      cannot do that -- you cannot get to any kind of notification

12      panel with any kind of snapshot.

13                  Dr. Sandler you just heard from.

14                  Dr. Mahon, Core's expert, agreed that if it's not

15      directly -- that's Core's expert, not LG's, he agreed that if

16      you can't get there directly from the main menu, that does not

17      respond to the patent.

18                  Mr. Martyn is going to talk about the fact that his

19      application snapshot has absolutely nothing to do with the

20      status bar.

21                  And Dr. Zeger's, whose explanation is, is -- again,

22      he sort of ignores the fact that you have to get there directly

23      from the main menu, and he says, well, as long as you can see

24      the main menu, for him, that's good enough.

25                  That's not the way patents work.           The words mean
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 63 of 145 PageID #: 16574 63



1       something.     They're important.

2                    Now, not only are you going to see that there's no

3       infringement here, but you're going to see some prior art that

4       was never considered by the examiner at the U.S. Patent Office.

5       You're going to see prior art such as the Blanchard reference

6       and other items.

7                    And, frankly, you're going to have the ability to go

8       and -- through a checklist, just like Mr. Hueston did, and

9       you're going to see each one of the elements in both the '020

10      and the '476 claims is present in that prior art.               And for that

11      reason, neither of those patents should have issued.                These

12      patents are not infringed, and they are invalid.

13                   Now, what was not mentioned is the fact by

14      Mr. Hueston that Core Wireless is in the business of buying

15      bulk patents and enforcing them for an income.               That's their

16      business.     And in this particular case, where do the parties

17      start?

18                   Symbian is in London, England, just to show you how

19      we got here.      That's where the patent applications were filed.

20      They were eventually transferred to Nokia in Helsinki, Finland,

21      through a transaction -- through the holding company for Core

22      Wireless in Canada so that Core Wireless in Luxembourg could

23      come first to its subsidiary in Plano and ultimately to

24      Marshall, Texas, for trial.

25                   It's a tortuous route that these patents have taken,
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 64 of 145 PageID #: 16575 64



1       but those patents were part of a 2,000-patent-bundle that was

2       purchased for an upfront payment of approximately $19,750,

3       approximately 900 -- excuse me -- $9.98 apiece.               That's what

4       the patents -- the upfront payment at least was paid.                That

5       19,975 (sic), that's for 2,000 patents.

6                   So please remember all along throughout this trial --

7       you'll hear it from the witnesses -- it's Core Wireless's

8       burden to prove infringement.          And it remains their burden.

9       Merely saying so and making you feel bad about Mr. Martyn, the

10      fact that he's not getting any of it, Core Wireless is, still,

11      you have to meet an element-by-element analysis for the claims.

12      You have to compare them to the claims.

13                  Please listen to, look at the evidence.             You'll see

14      where Core Wireless ended up with its fence post and where

15      they're attempting to stretch them now.

16                  These patents are both non-infringed, and they're

17      invalid.

18                  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.              And we look

19      forward to presenting the evidence to you.

20                  Thank you.

21                  THE COURT:      All right.     If you are present in the

22      courtroom and you anticipate being a witness in this trial, I'd

23      like you to come forward.         I'm going to ask all the witnesses

24      to come forward at one time and be sworn all at the same time.

25      That will save us time going through the trial.               If you'll come
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 65 of 145 PageID #: 16576 65



1       forward, our courtroom deputy will administer the oath to all

2       the witnesses present.

3                   (Witnesses sworn.)

4                   THE COURT:      All right.     You may return to your seats.

5                   Counsel, does either side wish to invoke the Rule?

6                   MR. HUESTON:      No, Your Honor.

7                   MR. HARRIS:      We do, Your Honor.

8                   THE COURT:      And do you wish the Rule to cover -- to

9       cover experts and corporate representatives or not?

10                  MR. HARRIS:      The Rule should exclude experts and

11      corporate representatives, Your Honor.

12                  THE COURT:      All right.     The Rule has been invoked,

13      except for expert witnesses and corporate representatives.

14      Therefore, if you're a witness in this case, but you are not an

15      expert witness, and you are not a corporate representative of

16      one of the parties, then you are subject to the Rule and must

17      be -- you must maintain your -- your place outside the

18      courtroom until you're called to testify.

19                  So if you're a witness and not an expert witness or a

20      corporate representative, you should excuse yourself from the

21      courtroom at this time and remain outside until you're called

22      to testify.

23                  (Witnesses leave the courtroom.)

24                  THE COURT:      All right.     Is the Plaintiff prepared to

25      call their first witness?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 66 of 145 PageID #: 16577 66



1                   MR. HUESTON:      Yes, Your Honor.

2                   THE COURT:       Well, before the Plaintiff begins their

3       evidence and calls their first witness, ladies and gentlemen,

4       we're going to take a short recess.

5                   This is one of those opportunities where you may just

6       leave your juror notebooks in your chairs.              We'll be back in

7       here shortly.      Use this opportunity to stretch your legs and

8       get a drink of water.

9                   Don't discuss the case among yourselves, follow my

10      other instructions, and we'll be back in here shortly to hear

11      from the Plaintiff's first witness.

12                  The jury is excused for recess at this time.

13                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

14                  (Jury out.)

15                  THE COURT:      All right.     The Court stands in recess

16      for approximately 10 minutes.

17                  (Recess.)

18                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

19                  THE COURT:       Be seated, please.

20                  Counsel, having sworn the witnesses present in the

21      group, if you notice later in the trial that a witness is

22      called who hasn't been sworn, please be sure to let me know,

23      and I'll try to watch that as well.

24                  All right.      Let's bring in the jury, Mr. McAteer.

25                  MR. NELSON:      Your Honor, we have basically an
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 67 of 145 PageID #: 16578 67



1       objection that we hope to resolve outside the presence of the

2       jury, that it seems like they're going to have Mr. Martyn say

3       something that we would object to.

4                   I think it would be more efficient if we address it

5       now so we don't have to interrupt the direct examination for

6       that objection, if that's acceptable to the Court.

7                   THE COURT:      Well, I didn't know you had a crystal

8       ball and knew what they were going to ask a witness.                I usually

9       don't take up anticipatory objections, but if -- I mean, have

10      you met and conferred with the other side?             Do you know this is

11      coming?

12                  MR. NELSON:      I haven't had time to, Your Honor.           I

13      know it's coming because they said it on opening.

14                  THE COURT:      A lot of things get said on opening that

15      never see the light of day during a trial, but...

16                  MR. NELSON:      We can hold it, and I'll make the

17      objection when the question is asked.

18                  THE COURT:      Tell -- tell me what the problem is.

19                  MR. NELSON:      The problem is their statements in

20      opening from Mr. Martyn that when -- that the statement was

21      that when he saw his invention being used out there in the

22      wild, that they knew that he was using his invention.

23                  Here's the problem:        Mr. Martyn has never seen the

24      patent claims, didn't see the patent claims until after this

25      lawsuit was filed.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 68 of 145 PageID #: 16579 68



1                   And so there's two problems with that opinion,

2       essentially, by Mr. Martyn.         The first thing is it's an expert

3       opinion.    He's not disclosed as an expert witness.              But more

4       importantly, whenever he made his observation, whether it was

5       in the 2007, 2008, 2009, Mr. Martyn didn't have any patent

6       claims to compare to whatever product it was he saw.

7                   So he can't draw conclusions about infringement based

8       on patent claims he's never seen.           He wasn't involved in the

9       prosecution of the patent.

10                  So from LG's perspective, testimony from Mr. Martyn

11      that, oh, I saw this in the wild, and they took my idea, well,

12      that's improper expert opinion.           It's not properly established

13      by comparing the claims to the accused product.               It's highly

14      prejudicial, Your Honor, and it shouldn't be allowed into

15      evidence.

16                  THE COURT:      What's the response from the Plaintiff

17      briefly?

18                  MR. HUESTON:      Yes, Your Honor.

19                  He's not going to say, I saw it, and here's what I

20      see in the claims that are violated.            He's simply going to give

21      his lay opinion of, I knew what my invention was, and I saw it,

22      and this was my response.

23                  Additionally, Your Honor, I note that in their

24      opening, they've now opened this door.            I think they even said,

25      you know, something about what the language of the patent that
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 69 of 145 PageID #: 16580 69



1       Mr. Martyn worked on and what it means.             And they're walking

2       into this direction.

3                    But the short of it is, we're not going to have them

4       say:     And when you saw it, did it meet all the claims?              We're

5       not doing that because we're not presenting him in that manner.

6                    THE COURT:     All right.     Well, I'll carry the matter

7       until I hear the witness's testimony.            And if there's an

8       objection raised, I'll rule on it at that time.

9                    I will -- since we have this opportunity brought to

10      us by courtesy of the Defendants in the case, I will tell you

11      that I think the Defendants got very close to violating an

12      order in limine on claim construction in their opening

13      statement, but I assume that's a fight we'll take up in the

14      trial.

15                   But it's clear that the claim construction order does

16      not require a combination of the summary window and the main

17      menu.    There wasn't an objection raised, so we'll wait and see

18      if it comes up in the course of the trial.             But I caution the

19      Defendant to stay within the bounds of the limine orders that

20      are in place, particularly with regard to the Court's prior

21      claim construction.

22                   Is there anything else, counsel, before we bring in

23      the jury?

24                   MR. HUESTON:     Not from the Plaintiff, Your Honor.

25                   MR. NELSON:     No, Your Honor.

1                     THE COURT:     Let's bring in the jury, Mr. McAteer.

2                     COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise for the jury.

3                     (Jury in.)

4                     THE COURT:     Please be seated, ladies and gentlemen.

5                     Plaintiff, call your first witness.

6                     MR. HUESTON:     Thank you, Your Honor.

7                     The Plaintiff calls as its first witness Mr. Mathieu

8       Martyn.

9                     THE COURT:     All right.     Mr. Martyn, if you'll come

10      forward.      If you'll come forward, sir, have a seat here at the

11      witness stand.      And you'll need to pull that microphone where

12      you can be heard.

13                    Be seated.

14                    THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

15                    THE COURT:     All right.     Mr. Hueston, you may proceed.

16                    MR. HUESTON:     Thank you, Your Honor.

19      BY MR. HUESTON:

20      Q     Good morning, Mr. Martyn.

21      A     Good morning.

22      Q     If you could pull the microphone in front of you to make

23      sure that your voice can be heard.

24      A     Okay.

25      Q     Mr. Martyn, would you please give your full name for the
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 71 of 145 PageID #: 16582 71



1       record?

2       A     Yes.    My name is Mathieu Kennedy O'Brien Martyn.

3       Q     All right.     Is this your first time testifying in court?

4       A     Yes, it is.

5       Q     All right.     What do you understand you're here to testify

6       about today?

7       A     I'm here to testify about my invention as represented in

8       the '020 and '476 patent.

9       Q     All right.     Generally, let's -- if you can begin, describe

10      what your invention is, and we'll get into the specifics later.

11      A     Well, the idea is to draw key data and functionality up to

12      the top of the phone that would otherwise be buried deep in

13      applications and make it very easily -- very easily accessible

14      to use as -- in one simple step.

15      Q     All right.     Let me ask you a couple of questions about the

16      patents in this case.        Are you the owner of those patents?

17      A     No.

18      Q     Do you have any financial interest in either of those

19      patents?

20      A     No, I don't.

21      Q     Do you have any financial interest in the outcome of this

22      trial?

23      A     No.

24      Q     Do you have any financial interest in either of these

25      parties in the case?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 72 of 145 PageID #: 16583 72



1       A     No.

2       Q     Now, are you being compensated for your time in any way?

3       A     I'm being compensated for my time, and I'm having my

4       travel expenses reimbursed, yes.

5       Q     And what is the rate of your compensation?

6       A     It's 200 Euros an hour.

7       Q     All right.     And is there a cost for you out-of-pocket to

8       come here and testify?

9       A     Well, yes, I'm using my vacation days from work.               And I

10      have to buy additional vacation days from my employer and

11      surrender salary to free up the dates to be able to come here.

12            And I can't have all of my vacation days doing this

13      because I have children.         I need to be able to look after them

14      when they're on vacation from school.            And we like to have

15      family holidays so I need to preserve some days for that.                 But

16      to be able to attend here today I have to buy days from my

17      employer.

18      Q     All right.     Sir, where do you live?

19      A     I live in a city called Townsville, which is in United

20      Kingdom about 30 miles north -- northeast of London.

21      Q     Okay.    In England in the United Kingdom?

22      A     Yes, that's right.

23      Q     All right.     And do you have a job in England?

24      A     Yes, I do.

25      Q     And what is that job?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 73 of 145 PageID #: 16584 73



1       A     I am the principal interaction designer at a company

2       called Telephonica, which is a mobile carrier that operates in

3       Europe and has a large presence in Latin America.

4       Q     Okay.    And this is your first time testifying, but if you

5       could slow down a little bit --

6       A     Sure.

7       Q     -- so we make sure the court reporter gets everything.

8       A     Sure.

9       Q     Now, Telephonica, what is that company?

10      A     It's a mobile carrier.        They operate in Europe providing

11      cell phone service to customers in Europe and in Latin America.

12      Q     All right.     And you said principal interaction design, and

13      what is that?

14      A     Well, the principal part means I'm a very senior designer

15      within the company.       And interaction design -- design

16      interaction is designing how a human would interact with a

17      system, a computer system.         In this case in particular, mobile

18      phones.    So I design how people interact with mobile phones.

19      Q     Okay.    And what are you currently working on at

20      Telephonica?

21      A     I'm working on an application that's called TUGo, and the

22      application is a way to connect your mobile number over

23      wireless networks for situations where you don't have good cell

24      phone coverage.

25            Because I noticed you don't really in Marshall very much.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 74 of 145 PageID #: 16585 74



1       When you come off the interstate and off the big roads, the

2       cell phone coverage dies away quite a lot.             This application

3       lets you stay connected by your mobile phone number to the

4       phone network over WiFi, so if you're at home with no WiFi

5       phone signal, you can still receive a phone call over WiFi in

6       your house.

7       Q     And that's what you're working on now?

8       A     Yes.

9       Q     All right.     Let's move to a different topic.           Let's tell

10      the jury a bit about your background.

11            Where did you grow up?

12      A     I grew up in London in the UK.

13      Q     All right.     And did you go to college or university?

14      A     Yes.    I studied for an undergraduate degree in psychology

15      at the University of Lieges which is in the north of England.

16      And after a few years working low-pay jobs, I studied for a

17      graduate degree in human factors in ergonomics at University

18      College in London.

19      Q     Did you graduate from the University College of London?

20      A     Yes.

21      Q     All right.     And you mentioned human factors and

22      ergonomics.     Can you describe for the jury, what is that?

23      A     It's the study of human capacities and limitations.                So

24      it's the study of how effective your memory is in certain

25      situations, how much thinking you can do at the same time.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 75 of 145 PageID #: 16586 75



1               The ergonomics part also looks at your physical dimensions

2       and how products should be designed to fit around your

3       capacities and limitations so that you can perform effective

4       work.

5       Q       All right.   And does your work in this area, human factors

6       and ergonomics, does that include interaction with computers

7       and devices?

8       A       Yes, it does.

9       Q       Let me ask you, what made you want to study this field,

10      human factors and ergonomics?

11      A       I touched on it a little in my undergraduate degree, and

12      in one of the jobs I was working in between the degrees, I was

13      working in a university library, and there were some students

14      there who were having trouble finding useful information to

15      help them with their studies.

16              There was a large pile of newspaper articles that would

17      have been very useful for them, but they couldn't use them

18      because it was too hard to search through everything.                The pile

19      was this high (indicating).         You don't want to search through

20      all of that to find one article.

21                   So I interviewed them and found out what kinds of

22      things they were looking for.          You know, I spoke to a few -- a

23      few students and asked them what things they were looking for,

24      what would be useful to them, and I looked through the articles

25      and designed a system that would allow them to search for
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 76 of 145 PageID #: 16587 76



1       articles and would help them find them in an organized --

2       organized way.

3                     So I organized the -- all of the articles, developed

4       an indexing system and worked with someone to build that so

5       that they could just go up to a computer, input a search term,

6       find an article, get the information, and then return it.

7                     So I made a big pile of unusable documents useable.

8       That was really enjoyable.         So I enjoyed that so much I looked

9       around to see if I could work more in that field.               Discovered

10      this master's course in human factors and ergonomics, applied

11      for and got a place.

12      Q     Okay.     And can -- do you have an understanding as to how

13      this field of human factors and ergonomics developed?

14      A     Yes.     It came mostly after the second world war where very

15      experienced test pilots were still crashing new planes.                 And

16      obviously, that's very expensive, and you can lose a human

17      life, as well as the aircraft crashing.

18            And they began to realize that this was because the

19      controls and the displays in the cockpits were too hard to use.

20      You know, you're in a safety -- critical situation in a plane

21      going very fast, you don't want to have to sit there figuring

22      out how to operate a control or what does it mean.

23                    So a lot of effort was invested in looking at how

24      controls should be designed to better fit user capabilities,

25      the pilot's capabilities in those situations.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 77 of 145 PageID #: 16588 77



1                     Also, there were -- there was a lot of research done

2       on radar and radar operators because they found they had very

3       motivated radar approaches that were still missing enemy

4       planes.      They could still get through despite the fact that

5       people were looking really, really hard for them.

6                     And so they invested time and effort in looking at

7       how -- how much people -- how long people can attend for -- how

8       long they can concentrate on a screen, and -- and they

9       redesigned the displays to make it much easier to detect

10      targets so that we can knock the enemy out of the sky.                 That's

11      where it came from.

12      Q     All right.     And is human factors and ergonomics important

13      in the world today?

14      A     Yes.     Practically every product that we interact with

15      enjoys the -- the benefit of the experience of a human factors

16      and ergonomics professional to support the design of that

17      product, to make it useful.

18      Q     Now, after you got your degree -- and when was that, your

19      graduate degree?

20      A     That was in 1996.

21      Q     Okay.     After you graduated, did you work in the field?

22      A     Yes.

23      Q     Put these -- this training to work?

24      A     Yes.

25      Q     And can you give us an example of that?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 78 of 145 PageID #: 16589 78



1       A      One of the companies I worked for was British Airways,

2       which is the main airline carrier in the UK.

3       Q      And was there a particular problem that you wanted to work

4       on and that you tried to solve?

5       A      Yes.    They had developed some self-service check-in

6       kiosks, very expensive kiosks that was installed at main UK

7       airports.

8              And these were -- the users could just walk up to the

9       machine and check in without having to join the queue and wait

10      for ages and -- and they were designed so you could have a

11      stretch free experience at the airport, check in yourself, go

12      straight to the gate, and have a pleasurable experience at the

13      airport.

14             They were experiencing lots of failures with check-in.                  It

15      just wasn't working very well.          People weren't succeeding in

16      checking in.

17      Q      People were not having a pleasurable experience?

18      A      No.    It was failing.     It wasn't working.       So they had

19      these very expensive terminals, and they weren't getting the --

20      the high level of successful check-in that they were looking

21      for.

22      Q      So what did you do about it?

23      A      Well, I took it upon myself to find out what the problem

24      was by going to the airport very early and -- and videoing

25      users using the machines.         And I developed a coding sheet so I
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 79 of 145 PageID #: 16590 79



1       could later watch the video and mark boxes to see what they did

2       do and what they didn't do.

3             And so I videoed a series of users and interviewed them

4       afterwards and discovered what the problem was that was causing

5       the check-in to fail and subsequently did a redesign of the

6       front screen and after redesigning that so that users weren't

7       just completely focused on getting their air miles, they could

8       successfully check in with the new front screen design.

9       Q     Okay.    Now, you've used the term "user interface" and

10      "user interface design."         Can you explain to the jury exactly

11      what you mean by that?

12      A     Well, a user interface is the bridge between a computer

13      and a human being.       So it's whatever you interact with to

14      communicate with the computer and how the commune -- the

15      computer communicates with you.

16            So in the case of a court reporter, it's the screen, it's

17      the keyboard that -- that she's using.            It's how the keyboard

18      is arranged so that she can input text very, very quickly.

19      That's -- that's the interface.

20      Q     Great.    Let me ask you, in your view, what makes a user

21      interface good?

22      A     It's one that makes for an effective interaction.                You can

23      get the job done.       You can get the job done quickly.           You can

24      get the job done without frustration.            And ideally, it's

25      pleasurable to have that interaction.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 80 of 145 PageID #: 16591 80



1       Q     And in your view, what makes a user interface harder or

2       worse, what kind of features?

3       A     One that's hard to understand; one that makes you feel

4       stupid; one that causes you frustration; one where you just

5       can't work out what to do, what the next -- what -- what the

6       right thing to do is in the situation.

7       Q     Can you give an example of a bad user face that you've

8       seen used?

9       A     Well, a TV remote control is not terribly easy to use.

10      You have a big slab that's absolutely covered in buttons and

11      sometimes with very small text labels above them.

12            And you need to be able to read in the dark while you're

13      watching TV to -- to try and operate the TV, and it's a bit of

14      a -- bit of a nightmare sometimes to figure out how to change

15      the channel, how to get up a list of programs.

16      Q     Mr. Martyn, was your invention in this case related at all

17      to user interfaces?

18      A     Yes.    It's entirely to user interfaces.

19      Q     All right.     We're going to get to the details of that in a

20      few minutes, but do you recall what year you had the idea for

21      this invention?

22      A     Yes.    It was either late 1999 or early 2000.            I think more

23      likely late 1999.

24      Q     All right.     And where were you working at the time?

25      A     I was working at Symbian at the time.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 81 of 145 PageID #: 16592 81



1       Q     And what was Symbian?

2       A     Symbian was a company that was set up by the leading

3       mobile manufacturers at the time to take smartphones into -- to

4       build smartphones.       Smartphones weren't smart at the time.

5             It was a company that was specifically set up to make a

6       whole new generation of phones, moving away from the existing

7       paradigms and designing a whole new kind of phone that you

8       could have the Internet on and that you could have music on and

9       that you could do all kinds of things with.

10      Q     Okay.     And how was your work related to your background in

11      human factors and ergonomics?

12      A     Well, I was taking all of that background and using some

13      design skills as well to design new interactions, to design new

14      ways of interacting with phones.           That's what the -- the role

15      of my team was.

16      Q     Okay.     What was it like to work at Symbian at that time?

17      A     It was a -- a fantastic opportunity for a number of

18      reasons.      It was a company set up by the leading manufacturers

19      of the day, like Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, Matsushita,

20      Panasonic, and Samsung joined the consortium after a while.

21            So there were lots of big companies there that wanted --

22      wanted to move to the next stage.           We had a great boss who had

23      come from Apple and worked on a meeting.             We had a great -- my

24      boss's boss was also a great boss.           And we were working in a --

25      a kind of operation like a skunk works.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 82 of 145 PageID #: 16593 82



1       Q     What do you mean by skunk works?

2       A     We were a bit isolated from the rest of the company.                We

3       didn't have to follow any kind of company rules.               We were just

4       given a mission and left alone to do the right thing.                We had

5       to report maybe once every couple weeks just so they could see

6       what our progress was.

7             But we were just unfettered.          We were left alone and to

8       get on with the job and to do the best job that we could as

9       quickly as we could.

10      Q     And briefly, what was the main project that you were

11      working on there -- well, first, let me ask you this:                Were you

12      ever promoted while you were there at Symbian?

13      A     Yes, I was promoted a few months after I joined.

14      Q     And what was the position you were promoted to?

15      A     Interaction design manager.

16      Q     And what did that -- what were your responsibilities in

17      that position?

18      A     I was responsible for projects.           I was responsible for

19      line management of members of staff.            I was responsible for

20      recruiting for pay reviews and that kind of thing for

21      motivating my staff.

22      Q     Okay.    And now, let me ask, what do you recall is the main

23      project you were working on at that time?

24      A     The main project I worked on at Symbian was a smartphone

25      user interface project called Pearl.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 83 of 145 PageID #: 16594 83



1       Q     All right.     And what do you recall Symbian was trying to

2       do with that project, this Pearl project?

3       A     Symbian at the time was involved in designing and making

4       user interfaces to be licensed by mobile phone manufacturers.

5       Pearl was one of those user interfaces, so the idea was to make

6       a new user interface for a smartphone and license it to as many

7       manufacturers as possible.

8       Q     Now, at that time, 1999, 2000, did mobile phones of the

9       time have user interfaces?

10      A     Yes.

11      Q     Okay.    And describe for the jury, what type of -- what

12      type of mobile phone interfaces, what were they like at that

13      time for mobile phones?

14      A     They were quite difficult to use.           You had a very small

15      screen and a range of buttons, and they were quite clunky.                     And

16      it was a lot of work to -- to navigate to features and

17      functions within the phone.         You could only see one function at

18      a time at the top level.

19            So there was a lot of slipping around, a lot of moving

20      around to find the thing that you wanted through lots of

21      different levels of hierarchy, and you often had to go menu,

22      down, down, select, down, select, down, down, up, up, up, up,

23      down, down, down.

24            And at each point in that sequence, you had to look at the

25      screen and figure out if that's the right situation for you, is
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 84 of 145 PageID #: 16595 84



1       that the option you wanted in the screen.             If not, move to the

2       next one, select.        And there was a lot of hunting around.           It

3       was quite a frustrating, time-consuming experience.

4       Q       All right.     And I'd like you to be able to illustrate that

5       to the jury.

6                       MR. HUESTON:     And so at this time, Your Honor, I'd

7       like to retrieve my clicker and present it to the witness so he

8       could walk through a visual demonstrative.

9                       THE COURT:     All right.   You may proceed.

10                      MR. HUESTON:     Thank you, Your Honor.

11      Q       (By Mr. Hueston) And so, Mr. Martyn, I've given you a

12      clicker there to walk through a demonstrative of -- of the

13      Nokia phone, 5185.           Have you reviewed this demonstrative?

14      A       Yes, I've seen it.

15      Q       And does it accurately depict what it's like to go through

16      those menus and retrieve information?

17      A       Yes, it does.

18      Q       Okay.     And were you familiar with the user interface at

19      that time of that phone?

20      A       Yes.     I used this phone at some point in 1999, I believe,

21      yeah.

22      Q       And is it a fair example of the -- what user interfaces

23      were like at the time of your invention?

24      A       Yes.

25      Q       All right.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 85 of 145 PageID #: 16596 85



1                     MR. HUESTON:    Let's go ahead and put that up, please,

2       Mr. Wietholter.

3       Q     (By Mr. Hueston) And there it is.           It's on your screen,

4       Mr. Martyn, and it's on the screens of the jurors.

5             Is that a picture of the phone we just discussed?

6       A     Yes.

7       Q     All right.     If you could, using your clicker, I'd like you

8       to walk through an example of what it would take to get down to

9       a point where you could see messages that were left for you and

10      then to take steps to try to create a message.

11            Can you do that?

12      A     Yes, certainly.

13      Q     All right.     Please proceed.

14      A     Okay.     So this is the -- the menu screen that you would

15      see after you'd unlock the phone.           You'd probably lock the

16      phone to stop from calling someone in your pocket by mistake,

17      which has happened quite a lot.

18            And so in this situation, after unlocking, you'd press the

19      menu key.      And then here we see the first of a list of

20      applications.      So it can only show you one at a time because

21      the screen is so small and because the dots on the screen are

22      so big.      And so the text has to be a certain size, which limits

23      the number of items you can display.

24            So this is the first one.         The phone book is not what

25      we're looking for, we're looking for messages, which probably
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 86 of 145 PageID #: 16597 86



1       won't be in the phone book.              So we'll scroll down, press the

2       down button to move to the next screen.

3               Messages looks more promising.             So now we press the -- the

4       big button in the middle which changes its label all the time

5       depending on where we are.              So we'll press that one, select.

6               Okay.     Here we are one level down inside messages, and

7       this looks like the first of a series of other options, so I

8       think beneath this, if you press down, you'd see voicemails and

9       maybe other kinds of messages.

10              So text messages, I think, is what we're looking for.                  So

11      we press select.        And here we see another level of menu.           So

12      this is the -- we've gone four levels down.                We've gone across

13      once.     So we're four lines, you see write new.             That's to write

14      a new message.        And the inbox, which is probably where we'll

15      find new messages, so we'll press down go to the inbox.                 And

16      then we'll press select to open the inbox.

17                      THE COURT:     Mr. Martyn, I know this is your first

18      time to testify, but if you'd slow down a little bit and if

19      you'd speak up just a little bit, it would be helpful.

20                      THE WITNESS:     Yes.     Sorry.

21                      THE COURT:     I promise you, you're going to get out of

22      here alive.

23                      THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

24                      THE COURT:     All right.     Let's continue.

25      A       Okay.     So we've just pressed select, and we're looking at
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 87 of 145 PageID #: 16598 87



1       the inbox.     And now we can see a list of messages finally on

2       our seventh step through.

3             And we've seen the list of messages, so the next thing

4       we're going to do is move back up and try and write a new

5       message.     So I press the C key to go back up, and I'm back

6       where I was before I was looking at messages.              I can see write

7       new as a suitable option for writing a new message.

8             Obviously, if I was elsewhere in the phone, if I was back

9       at the top level, I'd have to come all the way back down here

10      to get to write new.        But because we happened to be here

11      already it's a simple scroll up, and then select to write a new

12      message.

13            And at this point, the interface isn't really very clear.

14      It's not clear what you should do next.             It's a bit hard to

15      understand.     And -- but at this point, you would start

16      addressing the message.        You'd choose who you wanted it to be

17      to, and you'd start adding some text to the message.

18            So as you can see, there are quite a few new steps here.

19      It's a lot of work.       And at each point, you have to think about

20      what to do next.       Is this the right screen?         Should I go away

21      from here and find something else?           And it ends up being a lot

22      of work.     And it can be quite frustrating.

23      Q     (By Mr. Hueston) And at the time you were at Symbian --

24      and thank you for going through that example, which shows at

25      least ten steps, at -- at the time you were at Symbian -- did

1       you view this as a problem that should be solved?

2       A       Yes, definitely.

3       Q       And so what did you do in response to this problem?

4       A       Well, we did a lot of thinking.         We did a lot of

5       sketching.      We did a lot of research, looking at all of the

6       phones that were available in the market at the time.                We

7       did -- we had a lot of brainstorming meetings.               It was a very

8       creative atmosphere.        We were trying to come up with lots and

9       lots of new ideas.

10              So we were -- there was no rules really as to what was

11      allowed and what wasn't allowed.           Anything went.      And we were

12      trying to be as creative as possible.            So we did a lot of

13      research, a lot of thinking, a lot of sketching.

14      Q       Okay.   Now, when you left Symbian at the end of the day,

15      closed door, and started going home, did you stop thinking

16      about these problems?

17      A       No, it doesn't work like that.         You can't carry it around

18      in your head all the time.         You're always churning these things

19      over.     You're always stewing around in your subconscious.              You

20      can't -- you can't just stop it.           You can't turn it off like a

21      tap.

22      Q       Now, you mentioned a sketchbook.         Can you describe what

23      you did with your sketchbook?          Is that -- how did that -- how

24      was that part of your work?

25      A       Well, a designer normally always has a sketchbook to help

1       develop ideas.        You know, you draw something out so you can see

2       it.     That helps you think about it.         It helps you look at

3       alternatives.        It helps you evaluate it.       It's just a real

4       useful tool to have on you all the time to test ideas to see if

5       they're any good.

6       Q       Did you leave the sketchbook behind at work when you left

7       at the end of a particular day?

8       A       No.     It would be in your bag all the time or in your

9       pocket.

10      Q       And why?

11      A       Well, because you never know when inspiration is going to

12      come.

13      Q       Well, let me talk about that, do you have a memory of when

14      you actually had the idea for the invention in this case?

15      A       Yes.     It would have been late '99 or early 2000.

16      Q       And what do you remember about that?          Share this

17      experience with the jury.

18      A       Okay.     I was on my way to work riding a Tube train and --

19      you call them subway here -- so I was riding a -- a subway

20      train in London on my way to work, and it was early in the

21      morning.

22              And I was kind of in that zone you get to when you're

23      commuting or you're traveling to work, just going with the roll

24      of the train and trying to be as calm and relaxed as possible.

25      And an idea just suddenly bubbled up and came to me, and I
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 90 of 145 PageID #: 16601 90



1       pulled my sketchbook out from my bag and started drawing out

2       what this idea could be and then sat for a minute thinking

3       about it and thought this is good.

4             This is -- this -- this is new.           This solves a huge amount

5       of problems for people.        This -- this brings everything

6       useful -- the most useful stuff, the cream of the apps right to

7       the top.     This is -- this is good.

8       Q     And can you describe what you remember sketching out at

9       that time?

10      A     I can't remember exactly what it was, but it's very

11      similar to, I think, some of the exhibits in the case and

12      certainly to what's in the -- in the patents, the '020 and the

13      '476 figures.

14      Q     Now, did you have -- did you come up with a name for this

15      idea -- this invention?

16      A     Yes.    I called it at this time App Snapshot.

17      Q     And why did you call it that?

18      A     It was kind of hard to come up with a name for it because

19      it was quite a new thing, but the -- I mean, it came from the

20      fact that it's related to apps, and it provides you a snapshot.

21      It provides the key elements and the -- and the key data and

22      the functionality from apps and brings them up to the top so it

23      gives you a snapshot of what an app can do, but the real useful

24      stuff.

25      Q     Up at the top of the phone?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 91 of 145 PageID #: 16602 91



1       A     Yes, that's right, at the top level in a very easily

2       accessible place.

3       Q     Instead of going through menus and digging down?

4       A     Yes.

5       Q     All right.     At this time, I would ask you -- you should

6       have a notebook there.        And the notebook, Mr. Martyn, has some

7       exhibits.      If I can have you turn to Exhibit 176.

8       A     Yes.

9       Q     Do you recognize it?

10      A     Yes.

11                    MR. HUESTON:    Mr. Wietholter, if you could please

12      post it so the jurors can see it?

13      Q     (By Mr. Hueston) What is this document?

14      A     This is the patent disclosure document that I submitted to

15      Symbian where I described what the idea was to the patent board

16      at Symbian.

17      Q     All right.     And I noticed there's an author listed there.

18      Is that you?

19      A     Yes.

20      Q     Okay.     And what did -- let's go into the next page.             What

21      was the purpose of this document?

22      A     The purpose of this document was to explain the idea to

23      the Symbian patent board so that they could consider whether

24      the idea was worth filing for a patent.

25      Q     All right.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 92 of 145 PageID #: 16603 92



1                     MR. HUESTON:     And let's turn to Page 3 of this

2       document, if we can.

3       Q     (By Mr. Hueston) There's a Figure 2 there up at the top.

4       Do you see that?

5       A     Yes.

6       Q     Okay.     Do you recognize that figure?

7       A     Yes.

8       Q     What is this showing?

9       A     This is showing one example of the implementation of the

10      App Snapshot.

11      Q     Okay.     You said one example of the implementation.             What

12      do you mean by that?

13      A     Well, the -- the idea isn't limited to just what you see

14      in the figures here.         These are just an example.        It could be

15      presented in different ways.          We had other ways of presenting

16      it that we moved on to later in the course of the design

17      project to -- to make the smartphone user interface.                This is

18      just one example for the purposes of this document.

19      Q     Okay.     So did you mean, when you drew it out, to keep it

20      to just, you know, unread emails or text messages, for

21      instance?

22      A     No.     These are just example items in an example

23      presentation style.

24      Q     Okay.     To use this kind of lettering and format, was that

25      important to you?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 93 of 145 PageID #: 16604 93



1       A      No, not at all.

2       Q      So describe for the jury how this invention -- we have an

3       example of it here -- in your view, solved the problem of

4       that -- all the steps and the menu of mazes that you walked

5       through with the jury.

6       A      Okay.     Well, in one simple step, you can see all of the --

7       the -- the cream of an application at the top level.                The core

8       data and functionality of an application brought up to you at

9       the top level so you don't have to do lots of work to navigate

10      around the phone.

11             You can just browse and -- and choose what you want.                You

12      know, you're in control.         You don't have to do work to get it.

13      It's delivered to you, and you can access it in a very easy

14      way.

15                     MR. HUESTON:   All right.     Mr. Wietholter, can I

16      please have pulled up the comparative demonstrative?                Yes.

17      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) So, sir, in front of you on the left,

18      this is what you described as the problem.             It had at least 10

19      steps to do the task of looking to see what messages you've had

20      and then to start your steps of writing an email; is that

21      right?

22      A      Yes.

23      Q      Okay.     And what do we have on the right there?

24      A      This is one example of the -- the solution.             One example

25      of an App Snapshot.       So in this example, you can see all of
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 94 of 145 PageID #: 16605 94



1       those steps bypassed by being able to access those options

2       right at the top level of the phone in an App Snapshot.

3       Q     And how is it that this bypassed all those steps?

4       A     Well, it was a new kind of phone.           It was a new paradigm.

5       You know, we weren't designing for the old phones.                We were

6       designing for a completely new kind of phone, a bigger screen.

7       You could fit a lot more on the screen.

8             So we -- we didn't -- we didn't have to follow the old

9       model.    We were trying to move away from the old model and into

10      something new.

11            And we were looking at screens that were maybe three or

12      four times bigger than the Nokia 5185, and it was a -- we were

13      designing for a different context.           We were designing for

14      smartphones, for new devices.          You're always designing maybe

15      two years ahead of the phones that were out in the market,

16      maybe three.      So we were designing for -- for the future.

17      Q     And in your solution, how is it that this allowed a user

18      easier and quicker access to data and functions?

19      A     It's many fewer steps.        It's a much lower cognitive load.

20      You don't have to think so much about finding the data and the

21      functions that you want at that time.

22      Q     Because it's right at top?

23      A     Yes.    It's available to you in a really accessible place.

24      With one step, you can see all of that information, all of

25      those data and -- you know, that data and those functions.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 95 of 145 PageID #: 16606 95



1       Q       Do you remember showing your idea -- your invention to

2       people at work?

3       A       Yes.    I showed it to a colleague when I arrived at work,

4       and I showed it to my boss.

5       Q       What do you recall the response to be?

6       A       They were very interested, quite excited.

7       Q       Now, did Symbian ask people who came up with ideas,

8       inventions to take any steps before giving it to Symbian for

9       consideration?

10      A       Yes.    The people on the patent board were very experienced

11      in intellectual property matters.           My boss used to work at

12      Apple.     He had developed a lot of intellectual property while

13      he was there.        His boss in turn had also developed a lot of

14      intellectual property.        He had patents of his own.

15              So they knew the situation.        And they had a big

16      expectation on us to do due diligence before submitting ideas.

17      Yes.     We had to do a lot of research before we would submit

18      something for filing.

19      Q       Okay.   And you mentioned a patent board.          Can you describe

20      that?     Was that the company's patent board?

21      A       Yes.    It was a collection of senior staff members at

22      Symbian who had experience with intellectual property and

23      developing new ideas.

24      Q       All right.     And before we get to that process, did you,

25      Mr. Martyn, do some of your own research to confirm to yourself
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 96 of 145 PageID #: 16607 96



1       that your idea really was new?

2       A     Yes.

3       Q     What did you do?

4       A     I looked at all the phones that we had in the business,

5       and I did some Internet searching and other searching.                   I think

6       I searched the ACM, which is Association for Computing

7       Machinery, digital library, and -- and as much Internet

8       searching was possible at the time.            This was 2000.      The

9       Internet was a different thing.           But, yes, yes.

10      Q     All right.     And after you did your own searching and

11      diligence, did you submit it to this company patent board?

12      A     Yes.

13      Q     And what happened after you submitted your idea?               Well,

14      let me -- before I ask you that, did the company patent board

15      accept all ideas and suggested inventions from employees at

16      Symbian?

17      A     No.

18      Q     What was your understanding and experience about what

19      they -- what they often do?

20      A     Well, they would consider the -- the merits of each idea,

21      in turn, and figure out whether they considered it to be new,

22      novel, different, and -- and whether it was worth investing

23      company money in trying to get a patent for the idea.

24            So they would reject anything that they didn't think was

25      worth proceeding with.        I had a few ideas that were rejected.
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 97 of 145 PageID #: 16608 97



1       I had a few ideas that were taken forward.

2       Q     All right.     So what happened after you submitted this

3       invention to the company patent board?

4       A     I think after a few weeks, I heard that they'd accepted it

5       and were going to submit it for filing.

6       Q     And then what happened next?

7       A     I was put in touch with a patent lawyer that they engaged

8       to describe the idea to him and make sure he understood so that

9       he could go and draft a patent document describing the

10      invention.

11      Q     And who paid for that -- who paid for that patent lawyer?

12      A     Symbian.

13      Q     Now, were you involved in any way, then, in working with

14      this patent lawyer?

15      A     Yes.    It's my -- it was my responsibility to explain the

16      idea really clearly to him so he had a good enough

17      understanding of it to then draft a patent document.

18      Q     Now, at Symbian, did they give you an award or bonus for

19      this invention?

20      A     Yes.    I think there were two levels of payment.             One was a

21      filing bonus, so if they decided to file, you would get a bonus

22      at that point.      And if the patent was subsequently granted,

23      then you would receive another bonus.

24      Q     Okay.    And did the United Kingdom issue a patent for that

25      invention?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 98 of 145 PageID #: 16609 98



1       A     Yes, they did.

2       Q     Is it your understanding that your invention was submitted

3       for a patent in the United States?

4       A     Yes, I believe it was.        It clearly was.       That's why we're

5       here today.

6       Q     And is it your understanding that the U.S. Patent Office

7       has granted patents for your invention?

8       A     Yes.

9       Q     All right.

10                   MR. HUESTON:     At this time, Your Honor, I would like

11      permission to hand the two patents, the ribbon copies, to

12      Mr. Martyn.

13                   THE COURT:     You may approach the witness.

14                   MR. HUESTON:     Thank you.

15                   THE COURT:     Hand them to the Court Security Officer.

16                   MR. HUESTON:     Thank you, Your Honor.

17      Q     (By Mr. Hueston) Mr. Martyn, I have just put two exhibits

18      before you, 166 and 168.         If you could pull the original patent

19      copy out of Exhibit 166, please.           There should be a hard paper

20      copy, yes, with a ribbon on it.

21      A     Yes.

22      Q     Which patent number is that?

23      A     This one is '476.

24      Q     And if you could, could you hold it up so that the jury

25      can see the front page of it?
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 99 of 145 PageID #: 16610 99



1       A      (Complies.)

2       Q      And, sir, is your name on the front page of that patent?

3       A      It's not on this page (indicating).

4       Q      All right.

5       A      It's on this page (indicating).

6       Q      On the -- thank you.

7              And what does it say about you?

8       A      Inventor, Mathieu Kennedy Martyn, London, GB.

9       Q      And, sir, how does that make you feel to see your name on

10      that patent?

11      A      That's great.     This -- I've never -- I've never seen this

12      before.       This -- this particular version with the seal on the

13      front.    It looks fantastic.       I'm very proud of this.

14      Q      Let me ask that you turn to the other patent that came

15      from your invention.        I think it should be 166 -- I'm sorry --

16      168.

17             Do you see the original one there?

18      A      Yes.

19      Q      All right.     And which patent is this one?

20      A      This one is '020.

21      Q      And could you also hold it up so the jury can see the

22      front page?

23             And, again, sir, if I could have you turn to the second

24      page, does your name appear on this patent?

25      A      Yes.
                                                                                 100
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 100 of 145 PageID #: 16611



1      Q      And how does it list you?

2      A      Inventor, Mathieu Kennedy Martyn, London, GB.

3      Q      All right.     You may put that down because we will now look

4      on -- look in the computer here on the screens at some of the

5      specifics in the patent.

6             But have you had a chance to review both of the patents in

7      this case?

8      A      Yes.     I've seen them in another format, yes.

9      Q      And do both of them accurately describe the new idea, the

10      invention you had?

11      A      Yes, they do.

12                     MR. HUESTON:   Let's pull up, Mr. Wietholter,

13      Exhibit 166, so the jury can see it.

14      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) And this is a copy of the first written

15      page of the patent; is that right?

16      A      Yes.

17      Q      And you see it before you.         Which patent number is this?

18      A      '020.

19      Q      And on the left-hand side under United States patent, is

20      that your name?

21      A      Yes.

22      Q      All right.     And what I'd like to turn your attention to on

23      that front page in the bottom right-hand corner, it says:

24      Abstract.

25             Do you see that?
                                                                                 101
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 101 of 145 PageID #: 16612



1      A      Yes.

2      Q      Can you read it aloud, please?

3      A      The present invention offers a snapshot view which brings

4      together, in one summary window, a limited list of common

5      functions and commonly accessed stored data which itself can be

6      reached directly from the main menu listing some or all

7      applications.       This yields many advantages in ease and speed of

8      navigation, particularly on small screen devices.

9      Q      Mr. Martyn, how does this summary description compare to

10      the invention as you had it starting on that day on the subway?

11      A      It's a pretty good encapsulation of the idea.

12      Q      All right.     And let's -- these patents have things called

13      claims in them.       They're numbered paragraphs that come later in

14      the patent.      So I'd like to have you turn to Claim 1, please.

15                    MR. HUESTON:     And I'll ask Mr. Wietholter to move the

16      visual to Claim 1.

17                    THE COURT:     Counsel, approach the bench.

18                    (Bench conference.)

19                    THE COURT:     Mr. Hueston, you need to stop with the

20      sidebar comments.

21                    MR. HUESTON:     Okay.

22                    THE COURT:     "These patents have things in them called

23      claims."      You're just testifying.       "Thank you for going through

24      that, which shows at least ten steps."             Again, that's

25      testifying.
                                                                                 102
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 102 of 145 PageID #: 16613



1                    MR. HUESTON:     All right.     I'll stop.

2                    THE COURT:     You need to avoid sidebar comments.

3                    MR. HUESTON:     I will, Your Honor.       Thank you.

4                    THE COURT:     All right.     Let's proceed.

5                    MR. HUESTON:     Thank you.

6                    (Bench conference concluded.)

7                    THE COURT:     All right.     Let's proceed.

8                    MR. HUESTON:     Okay.   If we can pull up Claim 1,

9      please.       And there we -- there we are.

10      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) Can you please, this is a lot -- excuse

11      me.

12             Mr. Martyn, could you please read Claim 1?

13      A      Yes.

14             A computing device comprising a display screen, the

15      computing device being configured to display on the screen a

16      main menu listing at least a first application and additionally

17      being configured to display on the screen an application

18      summary window that can be reached directly from the main menu

19      wherein the application summary window displays a limited list

20      of at least one function offered within the first application,

21      each function in the list being selectable to launch the first

22      application and initiate the selected function, and wherein the

23      application summary window is displayed while the application

24      is in an unlaunched state.

25      Q      All right.     Does that language in Claim 1 accurately
                                                                                 103
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 103 of 145 PageID #: 16614



1      describe your invention, sir?

2      A      Yes.    It's kind of complicated, but, yes, it does.

3      Q      And does this language describe the App Snapshot that you

4      invented?

5      A      Yes, it does.

6      Q      I'd like to focus on the language inside of Claim 1.

7                    MR. HUESTON:     Mr. Wietholter, if you could please

8      underscore -- I'll quote it.

9      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) So each function in the list being

10      selectable to launch the first application and initiate the

11      selected function and wherein the application summary window is

12      displayed while the application is in an unlaunched state.

13             Mr. Martyn, do you see that language?

14      A      Yes.

15      Q      In inventing and designing your idea, do you ever use the

16      terms "launch" or "unlaunch"?

17      A      Yes, we did.

18      Q      And what did the term "launch" mean to you at the time?

19      A      It means whether the application is in the foreground or

20      not, whether it's filling the display, whether that's the one

21      you're working with now, or whether it's one that's not in the

22      display at the moment.

23                    MR. NELSON:    We have an objection, Your Honor.           May

24      we approach?

25                    THE COURT:     Approach the bench.
                                                                                 104
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 104 of 145 PageID #: 16615



1                   (Bench conference.)

2                   MR. NELSON:     Your Honor, my concern is, at this

3      point, we are now --

4                   THE COURT:     This is the microphone.

5                   MR. NELSON:     My concern, at this point, is we are now

6      attempting to backdoor some claim construction arguments into

7      the inventor's testimony as to what he thinks the language

8      means.

9                   The Court's construed the claim.           The Court's

10      construed -- the claim construction is plain and ordinary

11      meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art, but as you

12      know, the parties have a fairly sharp dispute over what the

13      plain and ordinary meaning is, and I believe they're using the

14      inventor to, you know, contradict the Court's claim

15      construction.

16                   THE COURT:     Response?

17                   MR. HUESTON:     Your Honor, we're not attempting to do

18      that at all.      We're just simply using that as a point for him

19      to describe what he understood "launch" and "unlaunched" meant,

20      which I think is helpful for the jury to understand what his

21      invention was.

22                   THE COURT:     Well, I'm going to sustain the objection.

23      I do believe you're asking for this witness to define specific

24      claim language.       There's pretty clear authority that the

25      inventor's opinions as to claim language have minimal, if any,
                                                                                 105
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 105 of 145 PageID #: 16616



1      weight in the claim construction process.

2                   And I understand there may be sharp disputes about

3      what the plain and ordinary meaning is, and I expect that the

4      experts to disagree about that.           This is not an expert witness.

5      And we're not going to collaterally attack the claim

6      construction order.

7                   Even though Defendants MIL 2 was denied, the Court

8      explicitly said the parties are not to collaterally attack or

9      attempt to undermine the claim construction of the Court.

10      That's what I was referring to earlier before the jury came

11      out.

12                   So I'm going to sustain the objection.

13                   MR. HUESTON:     Okay.    Thank you, Your Honor.

14                   THE COURT:     All right.

15                   (Bench conference concluded.)

16                   THE COURT:     All right.     For the record, the objection

17      is sustained.

18                   Let's proceed with the next question, Counsel.

19                   MR. HUESTON:     Yes, Your Honor.

20      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) Mr. Martyn, did you try to write any

21      computer code for your invention?

22      A      No.

23      Q      Why not?

24      A      I'm not a software engineer.         I'm a designer.

25      Q      Well, was coming up with computer code important, in your
                                                                                 106
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 106 of 145 PageID #: 16617



1      view, for the invention that you had come up with?

2      A      Well, if you want to make it in a phone, you need to write

3      code to support the design, yeah.           Yes.

4      Q      The fact --

5      A      But that's not a part of the invention.            The invention is

6      an idea about user interface.

7      Q      And how is an idea about user interface different from the

8      separate project of computer code -- coding?

9      A      Well, you're describing the experience you want the user

10      to have with the product.         You're describing how it should

11      look, how it should feel, what the user needs to do to perform

12      certain functions.       You're describing an interaction.           It's up

13      then -- it's then up to the software engineers to write the

14      code to make that interaction possible.

15      Q      Mr. Martyn, in coming up with your invention, did you

16      consider reaching your application snapshot or application

17      summary window in a short step?

18      A      Yes.    The whole point was to make it very easy to access

19      with practically no effort from the user.

20      Q      When you were coming up with your invention, did you have

21      in mind any very specific steps that had to be taken to make

22      that step?

23      A      No.    The patent's quite clear that there are any number of

24      ways that you could trigger the App Snapshot.              It wasn't

25      limited to the technology we had available at the time.                 We
                                                                                 107
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 107 of 145 PageID #: 16618



1      were designing, like I said, for the future, so we -- it was

2      very important to us that it be possible to trigger the

3      application summary window with any kind of technology that was

4      available.

5      Q      Mr. Martyn, let me turn to another topic.             While you were

6      at Symbian, tell us now what happened to the project you were

7      working on.

8      A      The project was ended because Symbian changed strategy and

9      decided to stop making user interfaces themselves.                So the

10      product ended and -- and Symbian then just made software, and

11      the licensees of Symbian, the companies that set Symbian up,

12      made the interfaces themselves.           Symbian just supplied the

13      software that was under the hood.

14      Q      Okay.     So was your project canned?

15      A      The project was canned, but the idea lived on because

16      the -- the patent was granted, I think, two years after the

17      project was canned.

18      Q      And let me ask you this:        After the project was canned or

19      shelved, did Symbian stop the presses and stop paying for the

20      patent attorney to proceed with the application?

21                     MR. NELSON:   Objection, leading, Your Honor.

22                     THE COURT:    Sustained.

23      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) Did Symbian take any steps one way or the

24      other to try to stop the patent application process?

25      A      Well, I guess not because it was granted in the UK in
                                                                                 108
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 108 of 145 PageID #: 16619



1      2003.

2      Q       Did anyone ever come to you and ask -- stop working on

3      that idea?

4                   MR. NELSON:     Objection, leading, Your Honor.

5                   THE COURT:     Sustained.

6      Q       (By Mr. Hueston) Do you remember anyone asking you about

7      whether you should proceed with your idea or not?

8                   MR. NELSON:     Objection, Your Honor.        It's the same

9      question.

10                   THE COURT:     Sustained.

11                   Restate your question in a non-leading form, Counsel.

12                   MR. HUESTON:     All right.      Thank you.

13      Q       (By Mr. Hueston) Sir, after the project was canned or

14      shelved, did Symbian communicate any thoughts to you about

15      whether your project should -- your application should proceed

16      or not?

17                   MR. NELSON:     Same objection, Your Honor.

18                   THE COURT:     Sustained.

19      Q       (By Mr. Hueston) Do you remember Symbian saying anything

20      to you after the -- the point in time when the project was

21      canned?

22      A       Not really, no.     Symbian changed its strategy, and we

23      moved on to other things.

24      Q       Did Symbian ever make any criticisms of your invention at

25      the time it changed strategy?
                                                                                 109
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 109 of 145 PageID #: 16620



1      A      No.     As far as I know, they continued to prosecute the

2      patent and seek to get it issued.

3      Q      Okay.     Mr. Martyn, have you seen your idea -- your

4      application snapshot in any smartphones today?

5                     MR. NELSON:   Objection, Your Honor.        This would

6      relate to the objection we discussed before the jury came in.

7                     THE COURT:    I'll overrule this objection.         He can

8      answer the question if he knows from his own personal

9      knowledge.

10      A      Yes.     I've seen some phones that have a pretty good

11      encapsulation of the idea presented in them.

12      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) And what phones do you remember seeing

13      like that?

14      A      Android phones made by Samsung, LG, HTC.

15      Q      And how did that make you feel when you saw these other

16      manufacturers with your invention?

17                     MR. NELSON:   Objection, relevance, Your Honor.

18                     THE COURT:    This witness doesn't own the patents.

19      I'll sustain the objection.

20      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) Mr. Martyn, are you -- do you have any

21      interest in trying to prevent LG from using your invention?

22      A      No, not at all.       I think it's -- it's really good to see

23      my idea out there in the market.           I designed it for users to

24      make users -- user's experience better with phones.                So it's

25      good that it's out there.
                                                                                 110
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 110 of 145 PageID #: 16621



1                   MR. NELSON:     Your Honor, we would object and move to

2      strike statements about seeing his idea out there in the

3      market.      He's not an expert witness and cannot testify as to --

4                   THE COURT:     You're going to have to speak up,

5      Counsel.

6                   MR. NELSON:     Sorry.

7                   Your Honor, we object to his statement as to what's

8      out in the market.        He's not an expert witness.         He cannot

9      testify as to alleged infringement.

10                   MR. HUESTON:     Your Honor, he's just giving his view

11      of his own invention.        That is all.

12                   THE COURT:     I'll allow the question.         Objection is

13      overruled.

14                   Let's proceed.

15                   MR. HUESTON:     All right.

16      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) Mr. Martyn, just a couple more questions.

17             Do you deny that modern day cell phones are more advanced

18      than the phones you worked on back in '99 or 2000 at Symbian?

19      A      No.   The technology has moved on a long way, but the --

20      the principals of user interface design remain the same and

21      people's needs and desires in needing phones remain the same.

22      Q      (By Mr. Hueston) Mr. Martyn, why did you agree to take

23      time off from work and come here to testify today?

24      A      Because I think it was a good idea I had.             I think it's

25      worth protecting that idea.           I think it's worth giving credit
                                                                                 111
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 111 of 145 PageID #: 16622



1      where credit is due.

2      Q      Thank you.

3                   MR. HUESTON:     Pass the witness, Your Honor.

4                   THE COURT:     Cross-examination.

5                   MR. NELSON:     Your Honor, may Mr. Harris pass up a

6      couple of binders for the witnesses?

7                   THE COURT:     Yes, Counsel.      You can have standing

8      leave to do that whenever you either put on a new witness or

9      cross an existing witness.         Although it's usually not lead

10      counsel that gets to pass them all out; it's usually some --

11      somebody lower on the food chain.           But that's fine, however you

12      want to do it.

13                   All right.     Mr. Nelson, you may proceed with your

14      cross-examination.

15                   MR. NELSON:     Thank you, Your Honor.

16                                   CROSS-EXAMINATION

17      BY MR. NELSON:

18      Q      Good afternoon -- or good morning, Mr. Martyn.              Welcome

19      back to the United States.

20      A      Thank you.     Good morning.

21      Q      You're -- that sketchbook you had back in the year 2000,

22      you don't have that anymore, do you?

23      A      No.

24      Q      So we won't be seeing that today?

25      A      No.   We used to get through lots and lots of sketchbooks.
                                                                                 112
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 112 of 145 PageID #: 16623



1      Q      And your boss or coworkers that you say were excited, we

2      won't be hearing from them today either, correct?

3      A      No.

4      Q      And we won't be hearing from any patent board at Symbian

5      today, correct?

6      A      As far as I know, you won't.

7      Q      And you don't have any of that research you say you did

8      back in the year 2000, do you?

9      A      No.

10      Q      Did you submit any of that research to the Patent Office

11      when you applied for your patent?

12      A      I didn't apply for the patent.          I didn't submit anything

13      to the Patent Office.        All of that was handled by the patent

14      lawyer.

15      Q      You didn't personally get involved in what that patent

16      board at Symbian did or did not do in assessing your patent,

17      correct?

18      A      I liaised with the patent board to explain the idea.               They

19      considered the idea.        They then engaged a patent lawyer who

20      drafted the patent after meeting with me.             I then reviewed the

21      patent draft with the lawyer, which was then submitted to the

22      Patent Office.

23      Q      Let me see if I can rephrase my question and make it

24      clear.       You don't know what the board did to -- in part of its

25      decision process to decide whether or not to pursue that
                                                                                 113
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 113 of 145 PageID #: 16624



1      patent, correct?

2      A      No.

3      Q      You didn't attend those meetings, correct?

4      A      No.     It was a board.     I was not in the board.

5      Q      Okay.     Now, you understand that it's the patent claims,

6      those numbered paragraphs at the end of the patent that define

7      the scope of the patent, right?

8      A      Yes.

9      Q      And you understand that you can't claim something that

10      already exists out there, correct?

11      A      Yes.

12      Q      And you understand that when you file a patent, the Patent

13      Office may reject the patent and ask you to narrow those

14      claims, correct?

15      A      I don't really know exactly how the patent prosecution

16      works, but if you say so, yes.

17      Q      Okay.     You do know that the patent claims that are in your

18      patents as issued are narrower than they were when you filed

19      them, correct?

20                     MR. HUESTON:     Objection, Your Honor.       May I have a

21      sidebar?

22                     THE COURT:     Approach the bench.

23                     (Bench conference.)

24                     MR. HUESTON:     Your Honor, I was just told not to go

25      into the patents and have him talking about that, and I obeyed
                                                                                 114
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 114 of 145 PageID #: 16625



1      the instruction.       And I'm hearing counsel doing just that.                So

2      I'm going to object to this line of questioning.

3                   THE COURT:     Mr. Nelson?

4                   MR. NELSON:     Your Honor, I'm really looking, for

5      example, for a "yes" or "no" for the witness.              We had much

6      testimony on direct about how he's comparing, I saw my

7      invention out there, they took my invention.

8                   I just wanted to establish for the jury that that

9      testimony is fine, I guess, for his state of mind, but what

10      matters in this case is whether the claims match the product,

11      not whether his idea of the invention matches the product.

12                   THE COURT:     Well --

13                   MR. HUESTON:     Can I have a response?

14                   THE COURT:     No, no.    You've -- I've heard enough.

15      You -- you've asked it in a way you're, in effect, asking him

16      to comment on the breadth of the narrowness of the claims, and

17      that is the same thing that Plaintiff's counsel did.                And we're

18      not going to do that.

19                   And don't consider that what he did in my sustaining

20      of your objection opens the door for you to do the same thing.

21      I don't want the nonexpert witnesses opining about the scope of

22      the claims.      You -- but let's move forward on that basis.

23                   MR. NELSON:     I understand your ruling.         I want to

24      make sure I don't step on it.

25                   THE COURT:     Well, I don't want you to.
                                                                                 115
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 115 of 145 PageID #: 16626



1                    MR. NELSON:    I would like to ask him just to confirm

2      that he just doesn't understand the claims, and he's not

3      opining or expressing an opinion on that.

4                    MR. HUESTON:     Well --

5                    MR. NELSON:    I just want to establish -- I just want

6      to neutralize the prior testimony.            I won't opine on the

7      claims.

8                    MR. HUESTON:     Your Honor, if I may respond?

9                    THE COURT:     You can -- you can ask him to confirm

10      that he's not here to give opinions on the claims.

11                    MR. NELSON:    Okay.    Thank you.

12                    THE COURT:     Then let's move on after that.

13                    (Bench conference concluded.)

14                    THE COURT:     Let's proceed.

15      Q       (By Mr. Nelson) Mr. Martyn, you're not here to provide

16      opinions on your patent claims, correct?

17      A       No.   I hope not.    It's the job of the attorneys to do

18      that.

19      Q       Now, you weren't involved at all in the prosecution of

20      your patent, correct?

21      A       Beyond reviewing the first, well, the draft of the patent

22      that was submitted to the UK Patent Office, no, I wasn't.

23      Q       So that patent application was filed in July of 2000,

24      right?

25      A       Correct.
                                                                                 116
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 116 of 145 PageID #: 16627



1      Q      And you assigned -- signed over the patent to Symbian in

2      June of 2003, right?

3      A      As far as I knew, any patents that were filed during the

4      course of your work at Symbian were the property of Symbian.

5      That was -- that's usually the way it goes when you work for an

6      organization.       Any ideas you come up with whilst working for

7      them belong to that company.

8      Q      So you did sign over your patent application to Symbian on

9      June 12th of 2003?

10      A      I don't know the date.        I mean, any ideas that I came up

11      with while I was working for them was theirs anyways.                That's

12      the way it works.        I can't comment on the date.

13      Q      You actually signed a separate document giving your patent

14      rights to Symbian, correct?

15      A      I don't recall signing that document.            I may have done it.

16      Q      Okay.     Good.

17                     MR. NELSON:   Let's take a look, Mr. Buitrago, on --

18      at Exhibit 306, Page 006.

19      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) So, Mr. Martyn, this is an assignment

20      document that is on file at the U.S. Patent and Trademark

21      Office.       That is your signature on that document, correct?

22      A      Yes.

23      Q      And that is the date June 12th of 2003 that you wrote on

24      that document, correct?

25      A      Yes.
                                                                                 117
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 117 of 145 PageID #: 16628



1      Q      So this is a separate document that you signed giving up

2      your patent rights to Symbian in 2003, correct?

3      A      Yes.

4      Q      So since -- it's been 13 years since you signed this

5      document, right?

6      A      Yes.

7      Q      And in those 13 years, after you signed this patent

8      over -- patent application over to Symbian, you didn't have any

9      discussions with the patent lawyers prosecuting the patent

10      application, correct?

11      A      No.    That's correct.

12      Q      You didn't have any discussions with anyone at Symbian

13      about this patent application, correct?

14      A      No.

15      Q      You didn't ask them how it was going, correct?

16      A      Correct.

17      Q      You didn't --

18                    THE COURT:    Speak up -- speak up, please, Mr. Martyn.

19      Make sure -- I want to make sure the jury hears you.

20                    Go ahead, Counsel.

21      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) This assignment and another document you

22      signed in August of 2003 were the last involvement you had in

23      any way with these patent applications, correct?

24      A      Correct.

25      Q      Now, you had left Symbian by 2003, correct?
                                                                                 118
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 118 of 145 PageID #: 16629



1      A      I left Symbian in early 2002.

2      Q      Okay.   So -- and you worked for about four separate

3      companies since then, right?

4      A      Yes.

5      Q      You moved on after the Pearl UI project was canceled,

6      didn't you?

7      A      Yes.    I -- well, I did other work at Symbian for a while,

8      then found another position, yes.

9      Q      And when you -- when you did apply for these patents, you

10      talked with your counsel about an award.             You got about 500

11      Euros; is that correct?

12      A      It was 500 UK pounds.

13      Q      Okay.   So -- and you were happy to move on after you left

14      Symbian to other projects, right?

15      A      Yes.

16      Q      You never called Symbian back and said:            I want a license

17      fees for my invention, right?

18      A      No.

19      Q      You claimed that you saw people using your idea.              Were

20      you -- when did that happen?

21      A      I remember seeing Android phones that had something very

22      similar to the idea in around 2000 -- I think 2011, 2012.

23      Q      Okay.   And you didn't call Symbian then?

24      A      No.

25      Q      You didn't call anyone?
                                                                                 119
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 119 of 145 PageID #: 16630



1      A      No.

2      Q      You didn't have plans to travel to Marshall, Texas, this

3      year until you got a phone call from Core Wireless's lawyers,

4      correct?

5      A      When I was speaking with their previous lawyers, they

6      mentioned attending court and mentioned where it would be.                     I

7      didn't know exactly when it was going to be, but they asked me

8      if I could attend court.         And that was sometime last year.

9      Q      So you got a phone call out of the blue from some lawyers

10      from Core Wireless, and they offered you a consulting contract,

11      right?

12      A      Well, they didn't offer me -- they -- first of all, they

13      told me that my -- my patent, the patent I filed had been

14      infringed.     They weren't dangling some big carrot in front of

15      me saying, here's a consulting contract.             They said:     You're --

16      you have this patent, and it's been infringed.               Will you help

17      us with the infringement case?

18      Q      At the time this patent -- at the time this phone call

19      took place, this lawsuit had already been filed, right?

20      A      I don't know.

21      Q      This lawsuit was filed in September of 2014, and that

22      phone call took place around May of 2015, right?

23      A      March, April, May, sometime around then, yes.

24      Q      Okay.   So nobody asked you about your patent, not a single

25      question about your patent, before deciding to file this
                                                                                 120
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 120 of 145 PageID #: 16631



1      lawsuit against LG?

2      A      I don't -- I don't recall any communication or knowing

3      about it, no.

4      Q      Well, to be clear, that phone call you got in May of

5      2000 -- 2015 was the first time you learned about this lawsuit,

6      correct?

7      A      Yeah.     I think it was an email I got from the previous

8      lawyers, yes.

9      Q      Okay.     And they did offer you a consulting deal on that

10      phone call, correct?

11      A      They agreed to compensate me for my time and getting

12      involved with the case.         I have a day job, and I work long

13      hours.       I commute a long way to work.

14             So volunteering my free time to help them with -- with

15      understanding the patent and explaining the idea is some kind

16      of sacrifice for me.        So, yes, they agreed to compensate me for

17      my time.

18      Q      And they're paying for your expenses as well?

19      A      Yes.

20      Q      Including your travel here to the United States for trial?

21      A      Yes.

22      Q      At the time that they called you in 2015, you weren't even

23      aware of the U.S. patents, were you?

24      A      No.

25      Q      Okay.     In fact, at that time, you -- the only thing you
                                                                                 121
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 121 of 145 PageID #: 16632



1      were aware of was a UK patent application, right?

2      A      I -- yeah, that's right.

3      Q      Okay.     And you had no idea that someone had filed and

4      attained U.S. patents with your name on them, right?

5      A      Correct.

6      Q      You had no idea that they had filed a second patent

7      application based on the first one, did you?

8      A      No.     That's correct.

9      Q      Normally, based on your interaction with patent lawyers,

10      you're supposed to sign something when a patent application is

11      filed, right?

12      A      I don't know quite how it works.          You produced a document

13      earlier that showed I did sign something.             I don't know.

14      Q      Okay.     You signed a document when you filed a patent

15      application in the UK, right?

16      A      I guess so.      I guess that's what that document was that

17      was produced a second ago, yes.

18      Q      Well, I don't want to confuse you.           If you don't remember,

19      you don't remember.         The document I showed you a second ago was

20      an assignment.

21      A      Yes.     Okay.

22      Q      So I'm asking you a different question.

23             Did you sign --

24                     THE COURT:    Well, let's just ask a question without

25      an explanation, okay?
                                                                                 122
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 122 of 145 PageID #: 16633



1                     MR. NELSON:     Yes, Your Honor.

2                     THE COURT:    All right.    Proceed.

3      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) You signed a patent application under oath

4      for your UK patent, correct?

5      A      I believe so.

6      Q      Okay.     We're not going to see that UK patent here today,

7      are we?

8      A      I don't know if it's going to be produced or not.

9      Q      Okay.     Have you even read it?

10      A      No.

11      Q      Okay.     So in the 13 years since -- do you know when that

12      patent issued?

13      A      No.     No, I didn't.

14      Q      Did you know that it issued in 2003?

15      A      No.

16      Q      And so you had this patent issued in 2003.             You've never

17      read it?

18      A      I didn't know it was issued.         I knew it was filed, but I

19      didn't know it was issued.

20      Q      So you haven't read the prosecution history of the

21      patents, I take it?

22      A      No.

23      Q      Okay.     And so you don't have any knowledge of the back and

24      forth between the Patent Office and Symbian's lawyers over the

25      years?
                                                                                 123
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 123 of 145 PageID #: 16634



1      A      No.

2      Q      Okay.     And when Symbian transferred the patent application

3      from itself to Nokia, you didn't -- no one told you about that?

4      A      No.

5      Q      And when Nokia, two years later, transferred the patent

6      application to Core Wireless, nobody told you about that?

7      A      No.

8      Q      When Core Wireless filed the second patent application in

9      the United States, they filed it without speaking with you,

10      didn't they?

11      A      I didn't have any communication with anyone about it, no.

12      Q      Okay.     I'd like to direct your attention to LG

13      Exhibit 109.

14                     MR. NELSON:   Mr. Buitrago, can we put that on the

15      screen, please?

16      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) So this is a three-page document.               I

17      want -- and you have a paper copy of it, but I want to give

18      you an over -- sorry.

19             First page of the document is -- says:            Substitute

20      Statement in Lieu of an Oath or Declaration.

21             Do you see that?

22      A      Yes.

23      Q      Okay.     Second page of the document --

24                     MR. NELSON:   If we could just show that, please?

25      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) -- contains a signature from a Philippe
                                                                                 124
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 124 of 145 PageID #: 16635



1      Salpetier.

2             Do you see that?

3      A      Yes.

4      Q      Now, Mr. Salpetier never spoke with you, didn't try to

5      speak with you in 2013 before signing this document?

6      A      I can't comment on whether he tried to.            I have no idea

7      whether he tried or not, and I don't recall ever speaking to

8      him.

9      Q      You've never met him?

10      A      No.

11      Q      You -- you have no idea who he is?

12      A      I have no idea who he is, correct.

13      Q      So someone named Philippe Salpetier signed this substitute

14      statement in 2013, correct?

15      A      I guess so, yes.

16      Q      And there's a check box.        You see up there towards the top

17      of that page, it says:        Inventor cannot be found or reached

18      after diligent effort, right?

19      A      Yes.

20      Q      So you had no knowledge of any of this until we showed you

21      this document at your deposition, right?

22      A      I think the lawyers in -- the other lawyer in

23      San Francisco may have shown it to me before.

24      Q      Okay.   So you had no knowledge of any of this until at

25      least you got that phone call in May of 2013, right?
                                                                                 125
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 125 of 145 PageID #: 16636



1      A      Correct.

2      Q      And have you ever -- had you ever read the claims of the

3      patents until May of 2015?

4      A      No.

5      Q      You haven't done any comparison of those claims to any LG

6      products, right?

7      A      It's not really my job to do that.           That's the job of the

8      experts.       I didn't know the patent was being prosecuted still.

9      I didn't know it had been issued.           I wasn't aware of this whole

10      process.

11      Q      And as Mr. Hueston confirmed, you don't have any financial

12      interest in the outcome of this case?

13      A      That's correct.

14      Q      That 500 Euros you got a long time ago, that's the extent

15      of your compensation for this patent, correct?

16      A      That's the extent of my compensation for the initial

17      filing of the patent whilst I was at Symbian.

18      Q      That's the extent of your compensation ever, isn't it?

19      A      Well, no.        As we mentioned before, I'm being paid

20      consulting for my time in attending this case to compensate me

21      for the money I have to pay my employer to get the extra days

22      and to compensate me for my vacation and my travel expenses.

23      Q      That's compensation for your time, right?

24      A      Okay.     Yes.

25      Q      Okay.     My question was --
                                                                                 126
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 126 of 145 PageID #: 16637



1      A      Okay.

2      Q      -- at end of this case, you're -- you're never going to

3      receive another dollar for this patent, right?

4      A      I don't think so.

5      Q      Okay.

6                     THE COURT:   Let's move on, Counsel.

7      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) Now, you testified that you did a lot of

8      research and you were generally aware of other phones and

9      product out in the marketplace?

10      A      Yes.

11      Q      And you are -- as a user interface guy, you were

12      interested in what other companies were doing on their phones,

13      right?

14      A      Yes.

15      Q      And you showed a Nokia phone on the screen there, but

16      that's certainly not the only type of phone that was available

17      in July of 2000, right?

18      A      No.     But the patent searching was done early in 2000.                It

19      wasn't in July.       It was probably in January and February.

20      Q      Okay.     So there were other phones available in January and

21      February of 2000, right?

22      A      Yeah.     The Nokia 5185 wasn't the only phone in the market

23      in January of 2000.

24      Q      There were phones that were easier to use than the one you

25      showed during your direct examination, weren't there?
                                                                                 127
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 127 of 145 PageID #: 16638



1      A       There were phones that had different button sets, phones

2      that had different models.           That -- that was one of the most

3      popular phones from '99/2000.

4      Q       There were phones with big screens in January of 2000,

5      right?

6      A       I don't recall seeing any with big screens in 2000.

7      Q       There were PDAs on the marketplace like the Palm Pilot,

8      right?

9      A       Yeah.     They were PDAs, but they weren't phones.

10      Q       Well, your app -- your patent and your patent application

11      are not limited to mobile phones, are they -- is it?

12      A       I don't know.        That's in the patent.

13      Q       Well, let's direct your attention to the patent.

14                      MR. NELSON:    LG Exhibit 60, please.      Let's just go to

15      the first column of that patent.

16      Q       (By Mr. Nelson) Now --

17                      MR. NELSON:    And let's highlight the text just under

18      the heading, Mr. Buitrago, of Background of the Invention, so

19      under the Background of the Invention.

20      Q       (By Mr. Nelson) Now, this stuff about the background of

21      the invention, that's not stuff that was in the patent

22      application you signed in Great Britain way back in July of

23      2000?

24                      MR. HUESTON:     Objection, Your Honor.

25                      THE COURT:     What's the basis for your objection,
                                                                                 128
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 128 of 145 PageID #: 16639



1      Counsel?

2                     MR. HUESTON:     He's opening the door into what the

3      patent has and doesn't have.

4                     THE COURT:     Overruled.     He can answer whether this

5      was in what he signed or not.          But interpretation of it is

6      beyond the scope of what he ought to be pursuing.

7                     All right.     Next question -- or restate your

8      question.

9      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) Yeah.        I just wanted to confirm that the

10      words above "background of the invention" aren't necessarily

11      your words?

12      A      No.     They were drafted by the patent lawyer.

13      Q      Okay.     Now, that stuff below the background of the

14      invention, those words were in the patent application you

15      signed under oath, right?

16      A      Do you mean the one in 2003?

17      Q      Yes.

18      A      Yeah.     But I don't recall signing that document.           But yes.

19      Q      And in that document you signed, you made it clear that

20      the invention can -- can relate to any mobile -- mobile

21      device -- computing device -- I'm sorry -- including PDAs,

22      right?

23      A      I didn't draft this text.           So I may have signed a

24      document, but I didn't write the text.

25      Q      So -- well, let's -- let me direct your attention to your
                                                                                 129
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 129 of 145 PageID #: 16640



1      signature under oath and under the penalty of perjury.

2                     MR. NELSON:   LG Exhibit 62, please, at Page 131?

3      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) This is the Declaration and Power of

4      Attorney.       Do you see that title at the top, sir?

5      A      Yes.

6      Q      Okay.     And I just want to show you all three pages of it

7      before I ask you questions.          The next page of it has some

8      paragraphs and some blank lines, and then there's a third page

9      that has your signature again, correct?

10      A      Yes.

11      Q      Okay.     You signed that in March of 2003, right?

12      A      Yes.

13      Q      All right.

14      A      April, I think.       That's a UK date format.

15      Q      All right.

16                     MR. NELSON:   Let's go back to the first page of the

17      document.

18      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) So right there at the top it says:               I

19      believe I am the original, first, and sole inventor.

20             Do you see that?

21      A      Yes.

22      Q      And further it down it says:         I hereby state that I have

23      reviewed and understand the contents of the above identified

24      specification, including the claims as amended by any -- by any

25      amendment referred to above.
                                                                                 130
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 130 of 145 PageID #: 16641



1             Do you see that?

2      A      Yes.

3      Q      You did review and understand your patent application when

4      it was filed, right?

5      A      Yes.

6      Q      Okay.     So you did review and understand that your patent

7      application applied to all computing devices, including PDAs,

8      right?

9      A      Yes.

10      Q      Now, we -- in the year 2000, you were aware of larger

11      screen devices such as the Palm Pilot?

12      A      Yes, Symbian made one as well callid the Series 5.

13      Q      And you were also -- you were aware of computers, right?

14      A      Yes.

15      Q      And you didn't disclose any -- any devices that you looked

16      at to the Patent Office when -- when you filed your

17      application, correct?

18      A      I didn't file the application to the Patent Office.               Do

19      you mean the patent board at Symbian?

20      Q      Well, sure.     Did you disclose it to anyone?

21      A      No.

22      Q      Okay.

23      A      I couldn't find anything in any devices that was similar

24      to the invention or that was the invention.

25                     THE COURT:   Mr. Martyn, limit your answers to the
                                                                                 131
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 131 of 145 PageID #: 16642



1      questions asked.       Your answer was, no, you didn't.           You don't

2      need to furnish the other explanation unless he calls for it.

3                     THE WITNESS:     Yes, sir.

4                     THE COURT:     Plaintiff's counsel will have an

5      opportunity to redirect later if they choose to.

6                     Let's move on, Mr. Nelson.

7      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) You're not a programmer, right,

8      Mr. Martyn?

9      A      Correct.

10      Q      There's no source code in your patent application?

11      A      No.

12      Q      There's no source code written by you anywhere in

13      connection with this invention, right?

14      A      No.

15      Q      Now, your patent -- you coined the term "App Snapshot"

16      while you were working at Symbian, correct?

17      A      Yes.

18      Q      And you believe that term to be synonymous with -- with

19      your invention?

20      A      Yes.

21      Q      Okay.     And you wrote some documents while you were at

22      Symbian further describing what you thought your App Snapshot

23      to be, correct?

24      A      Yes.     We write specifications for software engineers to

25      build it in code.
                                                                                 132

1                     MR. NELSON:   Let's look at LG Exhibit 108.

2      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) You've seen this document before, right,

3      Mr. Martyn?

4      A      Yes.

5      Q      This is -- you authored this document?

6      A      I wrote it with the other main contributors listed on the

7      document.

8      Q      It's a thick document, right?

9      A      Yes.

10      Q      All right.     And it's actually just one of many documents

11      that you wrote that describe the Pearl user interface project

12      that you were working on?

13      A      Correct.

14      Q      Now, the Pearl user interface project was the entire user

15      interface for a phone that unfortunately never existed, right?

16      A      Correct.

17      Q      And the App Snapshot is just a small portion of the Pearl

18      user interface, right?

19      A      Correct.

20      Q      Okay.     So you offered this document.        This one is actually

21      dated a little bit after you filed your patent application,

22      right?

23      A      Yes.

24      Q      Okay.     So this would reflect your best understanding of

25      your invention after you filed your patent application, right?
                                                                                 133
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 133 of 145 PageID #: 16644



1      A      Not necessarily, but it's an approximation.

2      Q      Let's look at the table of contents.

3                     MR. NELSON:   Next page, please.

4      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) So in the table of contents, you've got a

5      whole section down there No. 4:           Snapshot and Snapshot

6      Behaviors.

7             Do you see that?

8      A      Yes.

9      Q      And that's the portion of this document where you describe

10      what you call the App Snapshot?

11      A      Yes.

12      Q      At Section 2 there, do you see "menu component"?

13      A      Yes.

14      Q      Okay.     The -- that's something else; that's something

15      other than the App Snapshot, right?

16      A      Correct.

17      Q      Okay.     Let's take a look at it real quick.

18                     MR. NELSON:   Let's look at LG -- or Page -- I'm

19      sorry.    Let's look at Section 2.         It's going to be Pages 13,

20      14, and 15.

21      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) So I'd like to first ask you to look at

22      Pages 13, 14, and 15.        We'll put them up on the screen for you

23      and confirm that these are, in fact, drawings that you created.

24      A      Yes.

25      Q      Okay.
                                                                                 134
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 134 of 145 PageID #: 16645



1      A      Or they were drawings created under my direction, yes.

2      Q      Okay.     So these drawings that you created or approved are

3      not part of the App Snapshot, right?

4      A      Correct.

5      Q      Okay.     These illustrate a menu that floats in from off the

6      screen?

7      A      Correct.

8      Q      I'd like to direct your attention to LG Exhibit 107, which

9      is a document you already saw on your direct.

10             So the document we just looked at, that's something you

11      wrote in your late 2000, early 2001, after your patent

12      application was filed, right?

13      A      Correct.

14      Q      The document we're looking at now, this one you wrote in

15      February of 2000 -- and this is sort of at the beginning of the

16      App Snapshot idea, right?

17      A      Yeah.

18      Q      And this is several months before you filed your patent

19      application, correct?

20      A      Yeah.     Yes.

21      Q      Okay.

22                     MR. NELSON:   Could we turn to the second page of this

23      document, please?

24      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) Now, the document you were shown on direct

25      was black and white, but the original document you produced in
                                                                                 135
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 135 of 145 PageID #: 16646



1      this case was in color, right?

2      A      Yes.

3      Q      Okay.     So as you created -- as you wrote this in 2002 long

4      before you knew anything about patent litigation, you created

5      this little blue and orange colored drawing, right?

6      A      Yes, or it was created by a colleague under my direction,

7      yes.

8      Q      Okay.     Can we agree for the rest of these questions that

9      if I say you created it, that we would -- or under your

10      direction?

11      A      Sure.

12      Q      Is that okay?

13      A      Yeah.

14      Q      Okay.     So that blue bar at the top, that's a status bar,

15      right?

16      A      Yes.

17      Q      And it's not part of the App Snapshot, is it?

18      A      It's not part of the snapshot, no.

19      Q      Okay.     And what's below that blue bar is the main menu,

20      right?

21      A      Yes.

22      Q      Okay.

23                     THE COURT:   Counsel, approach the bench, please.

24                     (Bench conference.)

25                     THE COURT:   Where are we going with all this,
                                                                                 136
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 136 of 145 PageID #: 16647



1      Mr. Nelson?      Seems like we're just back again to claim

2      construction.      I don't know how to make my position any clearer

3      to you-all.      This is not a claim construction witness, and

4      we're not going to go beyond or collaterally attack the claim

5      construction.

6                   MR. HUESTON:     Your Honor, I would move to strike that

7      testimony because I believe that's just a backdoor way of

8      trying just that.       I've stopped from doing it, and I did.            And

9      he's just doing it in a different way.

10                   THE COURT:     Let me ask again for an explanation from

11      Mr. Nelson.

12                   MR. NELSON:     Well, Your Honor, actually, this -- the

13      purpose of this exhibit is to illustrate not about claim

14      construction.      It's about that "flying in menu" isn't in what

15      he put his invention disclosure.           That's all we want to

16      illustrate.

17                   MR. HUESTON:     May I respond?

18                   It has nothing to do with that in his question, and

19      it connects right to the opening and claim construction.

20      That's exactly what he was trying, and I would have to have at

21      least license to go ask him.

22                   THE COURT:     How much more cross have you got with

23      this witness?

24                   MR. NELSON:     Less than five minutes.

25                   THE COURT:     Okay.    Well, I'm not going to give the
                                                                                 137
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 137 of 145 PageID #: 16648



1      jury any express instruction.          But I'm putting you all on

2      notice that if I -- given these repeated explanations from the

3      Court at the bench, if I continue to see examination, either

4      direct or cross, that I'm persuaded is an attempt to explain,

5      analyze, go behind, or otherwise address claim construction

6      issues, I'm going to impose a penalty, all right?

7                   MR. NELSON:     Understood, Your Honor.

8                   THE COURT:     Let's proceed.

9                   MR. NELSON:     One -- the question that I mentioned

10      about the "flying in menu" isn't part of that document.                 Is

11      that okay?

12                   THE COURT:     You've already asked and answered.           We

13      need to move on.

14                   MR. NELSON:     Okay.    Your Honor.

15                   (Bench conference concluded.)

16                   THE COURT:     Let's proceed.

17      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) Mr. Martyn, I'd like to ask you questions

18      about a -- a user manual.

19                   MR. NELSON:     Can you put LG Exhibit 71 on the screen,

20      please.

21      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) Have you seen this document before,

22      Mr. Martyn?

23      A      No.

24      Q      Did you -- were you aware of the Ericsson R380 at the time

25      of your invention?
                                                                                 138
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 138 of 145 PageID #: 16649



1      A      Yes.

2                    MR. HUESTON:     Objection, Your Honor.        May I have a

3      sidebar?

4                    THE COURT:     Approach the bench, counsel.

5                    (Bench conference.)

6                    MR. HUESTON:     Your Honor, my understanding --

7                    THE COURT:     Just a minute.     I want to hear his

8      objection.

9                    MR. HUESTON:     Thank you.

10                    Your Honor, my understanding is this is the 380 phone

11      which you just excluded this morning, and he's bringing up the

12      phone -- the 380 with the manual.           You're introducing that into

13      trial, and it's been excluded.

14                    MR. NELSON:     So I've read Judge Payne -- sorry.          Are

15      you finished?

16                    THE COURT:     Go ahead.

17                    MR. NELSON:     Apologize for my eagerness, Your Honor.

18                    THE COURT:     It's the first day, but we're going to

19      get everything ironed out, I promise you.

20                    MR. NELSON:     We received the order this morning.

21      What the order says is that, first of all, these three

22      documents, they're on the pre-admitted list.              These -- these

23      documents about the Ericsson R380 are in.             The references are

24      in.    Judge Payne's order says the references are in.

25                    THE COURT:     Okay.
                                                                                 139
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 139 of 145 PageID #: 16650



1                   MR. NELSON:     The phone --

2                   THE COURT:     If the references are in, why is the

3      inventor being asked about them?           Why is this not a matter for

4      expert opinion with regard to prior art and invalidity topics?

5                   MR. NELSON:     Because, Your Honor, the user interface

6      for the Ericsson R380 was developed at Mr. Martyn's company.

7      He had knowledge of the products, and he did not disclose it to

8      the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

9                   THE COURT:     Well, we're not going to try any kind of

10      inequitable conduct issues before this jury.              Those are for the

11      Court, not for the jury.         I'm not going to submit an

12      inequitable conduct issue.

13                   So if it goes to a relevant topic, I'm happy to let

14      you spend as much of your own limited time as you want on it.

15      But going behind claim construction is not an acceptable topic.

16      And things that would go to the issue of inequitable conduct

17      that are for the Court only and not the jury is not an

18      acceptable conduct or not an acceptable topic before the jury.

19                   MR. NELSON:     Okay.    It had been my intention to ask

20      him questions from a prior art perspective.              Is it the Court's

21      position that that should only come in through experts?                 I just

22      want to make sure I understand so that we don't have to come up

23      here again.

24                   THE COURT:     It depends -- it depends on what you mean

25      by "I want to ask him some questions."             You're certainly not
                                                                                 140
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 140 of 145 PageID #: 16651



1      going to ask him for opinions.

2                   MR. NELSON:     No, sir.

3                   THE COURT:     I mean, what is the purpose of going

4      through this on -- on a supposedly factual basis with him?

5                   MR. NELSON:     I want to establish for the record that

6      he -- that there's screenshots of the Ericsson R380.                Whether

7      he had seen them, before or after, you know, he came up with

8      his idea, and that was going to be the end of the questioning.

9      If -- if we need to do that as an offer of proof elsewhere or

10      just do it another time, I understand the Court's position on

11      that.

12                   THE COURT:     All right.     Given Counsel's statement,

13      does Plaintiff object to that?

14                   MR. HUESTON:     Well, no, as long as I'm able to

15      explore that and --

16                   THE COURT:     What's good for the goose is good for the

17      gander in this court.

18                   MR. HUESTON:     Okay.

19                   THE COURT:     Let's keep it to a factual nature and

20      that limited scope.

21                   Let's proceed.

22                   MR. HUESTON:     Thank you.

23                   (Bench conference concluded.)

24                   THE COURT:     Let's proceed.

25                   MR. NELSON:     Can we get Exhibit 71 back on the
                                                                                 141

1      screen, please, Mr. Buitrago?

2      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) I'd just like to direct your attention to

3      Page 7 of this document -- I'm sorry -- Page 11.

4                    MR. NELSON:    Page 11.

5      Q      (By Mr. Nelson) Mr. Martyn, the drawing in the upper right

6      there --

7      A      Yes.

8      Q      -- that is a screenshot from the Ericsson R380 device,

9      right?

10      A      Yes.

11      Q      And do you recognize that?

12      A      Yes.

13      Q      And you were aware of that before your patent application

14      was filed?

15      A      Yes.

16      Q      All right.     Mr. Martyn, just one more topic.

17             The Pearl UI platform as a whole was canned, right?

18      A      Correct.

19      Q      Never made it into any Symbian product?

20      A      That's correct.

21      Q      And it never made it into any phone anywhere?

22      A      That's right.

23      Q      And it was canceled after you filed your patent

24      application?

25      A      Yes.    I think it was canceled towards the end of 2000.
                                                                                 142

1      Q      And -- and that happens in the mobile device business,

2      right?    Projects get canned?

3      A      Yes.

4      Q      Happens every day, right?

5      A      I don't think every day perhaps, but it happens a lot,

6      yes.

7      Q      Some -- some -- some ideas live and some die?

8      A      Correct.

9      Q      And you referred to that as hitting the cutting room

10      floor.    Your ideas hit the cutting room floor before they made

11      it into a product, right?

12      A      Well, the idea lived on, but the platform project was

13      killed, yes.

14      Q      My question was:      You would describe that as hitting the

15      cutting room floor, right?

16      A      Yes.

17                    MR. NELSON:    I have no further questions, Your Honor.

18                    THE COURT:     All right.    You pass the witness?

19                    MR. NELSON:    Yes, Your Honor.       Pass the witness.

20                    THE COURT:     All right.    Ladies and gentlemen, before

21      we -- you have redirect, Counsel?

22                    MR. HUESTON:     Brief redirect, Your Honor.

23                    THE COURT:     Well, it's five minutes until noon.               If

24      your brief direct gets us out of here by noon, we'll proceed.

25      If it's longer than that, we'll break for lunch.
                                                                                 143

1                     MR. HUESTON:     I'll finish within five.

2                     THE COURT:     All right.   Then you may proceed.

3                                  REDIRECT EXAMINATION

4      BY MR. HUESTON:

5      Q       Mr. Martyn, just a few questions.          You were asked about --

6      by opposing counsel whether you'd seen PDAs on the market --

7      personal display devices on the market in 2000.               Do you

8      remember that question?

9      A       Yes.

10      Q       Did you ever see your invention, the Application Snapshot

11      in any one of those?

12      A       No.

13      Q       You were asked if you saw phones with bigger screens in

14      2000.     Do you remember that question?

15      A       Yes.

16      Q       Did you ever see your Application Snapshot, your invention

17      in any of those?

18      A       At the time, no.

19      Q       Did you ever -- and you were just shown some manual for

20      the R380; is that right?

21      A       Yes.

22      Q       And you were familiar with that phone; is that right?

23      A       Yes.    I had one of those for a time.

24      Q       And did that phone have your Application Snapshot

25      invention?
                                                                                 144
Case 2:14-cv-00911-JRG Document 433 Filed 03/28/16 Page 144 of 145 PageID #: 16655



1      A       No.

2      Q       Did you ever see your invention in any product until you

3      saw it in the Android phones in 2011 and 2012?

4      A       No.

5      Q       So is there a reason why you didn't disclose to the

6      Symbian patent board the PDAs at the time, the R380 phone, and

7      the phones with bigger screens?

8                    MR. NELSON:    Objection, leading, Your Honor.

9                    THE COURT:     Sustained.

10      Q       (By Mr. Hueston) Did you disclose those phones to the

11      Symbian patent board?

12      A       No.   They didn't contain the idea in the invention.

13      Q       Thank you.

14                    MR. HUESTON:     No more questions, Your Honor.

15                    THE COURT:     All right.     Additional cross, Mr. Nelson?

16                    MR. NELSON:    None, Your Honor.

17                    THE COURT:     All right.     Mr. Martyn, you may step

18      down.

19                    THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

20                    THE COURT:     Is there a request for Mr. Martyn to be

21      excused?      Does he need to be retained?

22                    MR. HUESTON:     We'd like him to remain with the right

23      to have him retained.

24                    THE COURT:     All right.     Thank you, sir.

25                    Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to break for lunch
                                                                                 145
