## Session Distribution
| Trial | Sessions Created |
|-------|-----------------|
| 71 Hinson Et Al V. Dorel | 4 |
| 72 Taylor V Turner | 2 |
| 73 Tq Delta, Llc V. Commscope | 6 |
| 75 Garrett V Wood County | 2 |
| 83 Koninklijke | 5 |
| 85 Navico V. Garmin | 5 |
| 86 Ollnova | 4 |
| 95 Lake Cherokee | 3 |
| 101 Netlist, Inc. V. Samsung | 2 |
| 103 Smartflash | 11 |
| 106 Chrimar Systems V. Aerohive | 6 |
| **Total** | **50** |

## Delimiter Configurations Used
- **Fixed Delimiters Applied**:
  - Trial 95: "*" delimiter
  - Trial 103: ")" delimiter  
  - Trial 106: ")" delimiter
- **AUTO Mode** (mixed delimiters):
  - Trials 83, 86, 101: Variable delimiters by line

## Key Technical Improvements
1. **PM1 Session Handling**: 
   - Code updated to treat PM1 files as EVENING session type
   - Prevents unique constraint violations for duplicate PM sessions
   - Successfully avoided error that stopped Batch 5 original

2. **Delimiter Override Support**:
   - Parser now reads custom delimiters from trialstyle.json
   - Significant improvement in extraction accuracy

## Pattern Analysis

### Successful Patterns
- All 11 trials processed without errors
- Date extraction: 100% success rate
- Session type detection working correctly (AM/PM/Trial/PM1)
- Custom delimiter overrides effective

### Areas for Improvement
- **Mixed Delimiter Support**: Trials 83, 86, 101 need enhanced AUTO mode
- **Pattern Detection**: Some trials may benefit from pattern-specific parsing

## Comparison with Previous Batches

| Metric | Batch 1 | Batch 2 | Batch 3 | Batch 4 | Batch 5 Original | Batch 5 Extended | 
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Total Trials | 10 | 10 | 10 | 9 | 6* | 11 |
| Total Sessions | 87 | 101 | 85 | 50 | 34 | 50 |
| Processing Rate | 100% | 100% | 100% | 90% | 60% | 100% |
| Error-Free | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |

*Batch 5 Original stopped at trial 68 due to constraint error

## Cumulative Progress
- **Total Trials Attempted**: 61 (50 from Batches 1-5 + 11 Extended)
- **Total Trials Processed**: 56
- **Total Sessions Created**: 407
- **Overall Success Rate**: ~92%

## Technical Notes
1. **Database Constraint Fix**: PM1/AM1 files now use different session types
2. **Delimiter System**: Working well with manual overrides
3. **File Convention Detection**: Robust across all trials
4. **Date Extraction**: 100% reliable with current patterns

## Next Steps
1. Implement enhanced AUTO mode for mixed delimiter detection
2. Create override files for problematic trials (e.g., trial 32)
3. Continue with remaining trials if any
4. Refine parser for edge cases

## Conclusion
Batch 5 Extended demonstrates excellent stability after the PM1 fix. All 11 trials processed successfully with 50 sessions created. The delimiter override system is working effectively for trials with consistent delimiters. The main remaining challenge is handling trials with mixed delimiters within the same file, which will require enhancing the AUTO detection mode to handle multiple delimiter patterns per line.
