03:53:06   16            (Jury trial.)

03:53:06   17            THE COURT:    All right.     Counsel, we still do not

03:53:08   18   have a verdict from the jury.       They are clearly still

03:53:10   19   deliberating.     It's about six or seven minutes until 4:00

03:53:13   20   p.m.   You're welcome to remain here and wait for a verdict

03:53:18   21   with the Court.     Or if you're offsite, have your cell

03:53:24   22   phones on, and be prompt when we call you to return.

03:53:27   23            Other than that, we stand in recess.

03:53:29   24            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

03:53:30   25            (Recess.)

04:00:34    2           (Jury trial.)

04:00:34    3           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

04:00:36    4           THE COURT:     Be seated, please.      Counsel, I've

04:00:42    5   received the following note from the jury delivered by the

04:00:45    6   Court Security Officer.

04:00:46    7           And it says:     We have reached a unanimous

04:00:50    8   decision.    Thanks.   Elizabeth Edwards.

04:00:54    9           I'll mark this as Item 3 for identification, and

04:00:57   10   I'll hand the original to the courtroom deputy.

04:00:59   11           Let me ask, is either Plaintiff or Defendant aware

04:01:12   12   of anything the Court should take up before I bring in the

04:01:15   13   jury and receive the verdict?

04:01:17   14           MS. TRUELOVE:     Nothing from Plaintiff, Your Honor.

04:01:19   15           MR. DACUS:     Nothing from Amazon, Your Honor.

04:01:20   16           THE COURT:     I probably don't need to say this, but

04:01:22   17   I will out of an abundance of caution.

04:01:25   18           No matter what the verdict is, I don't expect any

04:01:28   19   reactions from anyone in the courtroom.         I think you all

04:01:31   20   know and understand that.

04:01:32   21           All right.     Let's bring in the jury, please,

04:01:34   22   Mr. Mixon.

04:01:35   23           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

04:02:20   24           (Jury in.)

04:02:21   25           THE COURT:     Please be seated.

                                                                                   1520



04:02:22    1              Ms. Edwards, I understand you're the foreperson of

04:02:27    2   the jury?

04:02:27    3              THE FOREPERSON:   Yes, sir.

04:02:28    4              THE COURT:   Has the jury reached a unanimous

04:02:30    5   verdict?

04:02:32    6              THE FOREPERSON:   Yes, sir.

04:02:33    7              THE COURT:   Would you hand the signed and dated

04:02:39    8   verdict form to the Court Security Officer who will bring

04:02:46    9   it to me?

04:02:55   10              Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm going to

04:03:22   11   announce the verdict into the record at this time.            And I'd

04:03:26   12   like each member of the jury to listen very carefully as I

04:03:30   13   do.   Because after I have announced the verdict into the

04:03:34   14   record, I'm going to poll the jury and ask each of you if

04:03:37   15   this is, in fact, your verdict so we can confirm on the

04:03:40   16   record that it is the unanimous verdict of all eight

04:03:43   17   members of the jury.

04:03:43   18              Turning to the verdict form.      The first question

04:03:54   19   is located on Page 4.

04:03:56   20              Question No. 1:   Did Vocalife prove by a

04:04:00   21   preponderance of the evidence that Amazon infringed any of

04:04:03   22   the asserted claims?

04:04:04   23              The jury's answer is:    Yes.

04:04:07   24              Turning to Question No. 2 on the verdict form.

04:04:17   25              Did Amazon prove by clear and convincing evidence

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 341 Filed 10/09/20 Page 128 of 136 PageID #: 19923
                                                                                   1521



04:04:18    1   that any of the following asserted claims are invalid?

04:04:22    2               Claim 1 of the '049 patent, the jury's answer

04:04:28    3   is:   No.

04:04:29    4               Claim 8 of the '049 patent, the jury's answer

04:04:34    5   is:   No.

04:04:34    6               Question 3:    Did Vocalife prove by a preponderance

04:04:41    7   of the evidence that Amazon willfully infringed any of the

04:04:43    8   asserted claims that you found were infringed?

04:04:48    9               The jury's answer is:    No.

04:04:51   10               Question 4B of the verdict form:      What sum of

04:04:58   11   money, if any, paid now in cash has Vocalife proven by a

04:05:03   12   preponderance of the evidence would compensate Vocalife for

04:05:07   13   its damages resulting from infringement?

04:05:10   14               The jury's answer:    $5 million.

04:05:14   15               Question 4B:    Is the amount you awarded in

04:05:25   16   Question 4A a lump sum representing damages for past and

04:05:30   17   future sales, or is the amount you awarded in Question 4A a

04:05:34   18   reasonable royalty for past sales only?

04:05:35   19               The jury's answer:    Is lump sum.

04:05:38   20               Turning to Page 9, the final page of the verdict

04:05:45   21   form, I find that it is dated with today's date, October

04:05:49   22   the 8th, 2020.     And it's signed by Ms. Elizabeth Edwards,

04:05:53   23   as foreperson of the jury.

04:05:56   24               Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm now going to

04:05:59   25   poll you to make sure this is, in fact, the unanimous

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 341 Filed 10/09/20 Page 129 of 136 PageID #: 19924
                                                                                   1522



04:06:02    1   verdict of the entire eight member -- eight members of our

04:06:07    2   jury.

04:06:07    3             If this is your verdict as I have read it and

04:06:10    4   announced it, would you please stand up?

04:06:13    5             (Jury polled.)

04:06:19    6             THE COURT:   Thank you.     Please be seated.

04:06:21    7             Let the record reflect that all eight members of

04:06:26    8   the jury immediately stood and rose in response to the

04:06:30    9   Court's question to poll the jury.

04:06:32   10             Ladies and gentlemen, I find that this is the

04:06:34   11   unanimous verdict of all eight members of the jury.            And

04:06:36   12   the Court accepts your verdict.       And I will deliver the

04:06:39   13   original signed verdict form to the courtroom deputy.

04:06:42   14             Ladies and gentlemen, this now completes the trial

04:06:46   15   of this case.     From the very beginning of it, I've been

04:06:50   16   giving you instructions over and over and over again about

04:06:54   17   not discussing this case or your experience or what you

04:06:58   18   think about anything that's happened here in court with

04:07:01   19   anyone.


04:15:07   19            I cannot tell you what the State of Texas might

04:15:09   20   do.   But the United States District Court for the Eastern

04:15:14   21   District of Texas will not call you for jury duty for the

04:15:16   22   next two years.     After that period of time, your name will

04:15:20   23   go back in the hopper.

04:15:21   24            If you need anything that you've not already been

04:15:26   25   able to get from Ms. Clendening regarding anything related

04:15:30    1   to your jury service, she is in the clerk's office, and she

04:15:33    2   will be more than happy to accommodate you as you leave.

04:15:36    3           Let me say one more time how much the Court

04:15:39    4   appreciates your service, how much the Court recognizes the

04:15:43    5   importance of the service that you've rendered.           And let me

04:15:47    6   thank you one more time for your hard work as jurors in

04:15:51    7   this case.

04:15:52    8           You are discharged from your position as jurors.

04:15:56    9   Ladies and gentlemen, travel to your home safely.           The

04:15:59   10   Court wishes you nothing but the best.         And you are excused

04:16:02   11   to leave at this time.

04:16:03   12           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

04:16:04   13           (Jury out.)

04:16:04   14           THE COURT:     Counsel, that completes the trial of

04:16:27   15   this case.   You are excused.
