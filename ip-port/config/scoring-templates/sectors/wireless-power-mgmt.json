  "contextDescription": "Wireless power management patents cover techniques to extend battery life and optimize power consumption in wireless devices. Key areas include DRX (Discontinuous Reception), power control algorithms, transmit power optimization, sleep modes, and energy-efficient protocols. Targets include mobile device OEMs, chipset vendors, and infrastructure equipment manufacturers.",
  "scoringGuidance": [
    "DRX optimization patents are high value as 5G power consumption is a major device concern.",
    "Patents covering connected-mode DRX (C-DRX) target smartphone battery life directly.",
    "Power control patents that span uplink and downlink have broader applicability.",
    "IoT/LPWAN power optimization patents target massive IoT deployments.",
    "Patents addressing trade-offs between latency and power are strategically valuable for 5G."
