Feature 9d

When we mouse over the timesheet in the column for tasks, if there are associated IT Activities, let's create a summary in a mouseover popup that shows each associated IT Actvity, and its duration, and also any delta of actual hours with respect to the sum of associated IT Activities (e.g., if actual hours for timesheet entry is 5 hours and there are two associated IT activities with 3 hours total, then there are 2 extra hours of "Unassociated Duration".

Let's also add an additional filter to the IT Activities screen that allows a text search within Title/Description.  They user can leave it blank and it will work as currently or the user should be able to type any text that can be used search within title/description for a match (and work in conjunction with other filters).

Under the admin interface for team members, have the ability to view passwords (with an icon to toggle to viewable mode in the password textbox).
