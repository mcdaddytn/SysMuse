Feature 2

Add New Task Functionality

When a task is selected (either from timesheet or from it activities page), we should have the abillity to "Add New Task" or select a task that is already associated with the selected matter.  As long as a matter is selected, we should have at least that single option "Add New Task", but also the option of selecting a task already associated with the matter selected.  The "Add New Task" should be up a dialog allowing the user to add a new task which will be associated with the matter and selected when the dialog closes (unless the user cancels out from the dialog).  This functionality should be consistent whether on the timesheet page or the IT activities page.
