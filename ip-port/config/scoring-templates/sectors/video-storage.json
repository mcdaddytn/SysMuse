  "contextDescription": "Video storage patents cover recording, time-shifting, and asset management for video content. Key areas include DVR (local and network), cloud DVR, trick-play (fast-forward, rewind), storage optimization, and video asset management systems. Targets include pay-TV operators, cloud DVR providers, and consumer electronics manufacturers.",
  "scoringGuidance": [
    "Cloud DVR patents are high value as pay-TV shifts recording to the cloud.",
    "Network DVR patents addressing 'copy once' vs 'copy many' have regulatory implications.",
    "Trick-play optimization patents (thumbnail generation, I-frame seeking) have broad applicability.",
    "Storage efficiency patents (deduplication, tiered storage) reduce operator costs.",
    "Patents enabling 'Start Over' and 'Catch Up' TV features are strategically valuable."
