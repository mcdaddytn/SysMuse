Feature 8 

**
This feature is not ready yet, and we might combine this type of logic with more advanced features, such as using expressions to figure out what matter and task is.  In other words, this will help us model the task workflows for various legal activities.

For associations, let's add actions that will create the description for the task when adding new.  For example, if we are right clicking on a document that has been modified, we can have actions like "Revising", "Reviewing", "Draft 1", etc.  For LLMs, we can do "Research", "Writing", etc., and combine with the title of the document or chat.

So for example, if we have an IT activity that tells us a Microsoft Word document was modified.  The user might select "First Draft" and we might append that activity to file name like so::  "Acme Corporation Claims - First Draft".
