## Key Observations

1. **100% Success Rate**: All 10 trials completed both Phase 1 and Phase 2 successfully
2. **High Event Counts**: Average of 6,566 events per trial
3. **Statement Dominance**: 97.3% of all events are statement events
4. **Witness Resolution Issues**: Despite warnings, witness events were successfully created (268 total)
5. **Delimiter Detection**: Trial 35 correctly identified "*" delimiter pattern

## Known Issues
- **Witness Resolution Warnings**: "Unable to resolve A speaker - no current witness" warnings throughout Phase 2
  - Despite warnings, witness events were successfully created
  - This is a known pattern issue to be addressed via trialstyle.json customization

## Performance Metrics
- **Phase 1 Duration**: ~24 seconds
- **Phase 2 Duration**: ~7 minutes for all 10 trials
- **Average Events per Session**: 841
- **Average Sessions per Trial**: 7.8

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Trials**: 10
- **Total Sessions**: 78
- **Total Events Processed**: 65,658
  - Statement Events: 63,865
  - Witness Called Events: 268
  - Court Directive Events: 1,525
- **Success Rate**: 100% (10/10 trials fully processed)

## Comparison with Previous Batches

| Metric | Batch 1 | Batch 2 | Batch 3 | Batch 4 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Total Trials | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Total Sessions | 87 | 85 | 89 | 78 |
| Phase 1 Success | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Phase 2 Success | 40% | 50% | 50% | 100% |
| Total Events | ~20K | ~25K | 52,176 | 65,658 |

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing with next batch of 10 trials
2. Apply trialstyle.json customizations for witness resolution patterns
3. Document successful patterns from this batch

## Conclusion
Batch 4 shows exceptional performance with 100% success rate in both phases. All trials generated events successfully, with the highest event count so far (65,658). Despite witness resolution warnings, the system successfully created all event types. This batch demonstrates the parser's robustness when handling standard-format trials.
