  "contextDescription": "Wireless services patents cover the higher-layer services delivered over wireless networks. Key areas include location-based services (LBS), messaging (SMS, RCS), voice over LTE (VoLTE), push notifications, and mobile application enablement. Targets include mobile operators, OTT service providers, and mobile platform vendors.",
  "scoringGuidance": [
    "Location-based services patents are high value as indoor positioning becomes mainstream.",
    "VoLTE/VoNR patents are relevant as voice transitions to IP-based delivery.",
    "RCS messaging patents target operator messaging modernization.",
    "Emergency services (E911, eCall) patents have regulatory compliance value.",
