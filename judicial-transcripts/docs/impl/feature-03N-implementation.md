# Feature-03N Implementation Guide: Witness and Attorney Speaker Resolution

## Overview
This guide documents the implementation of robust witness detection and speaker resolution for Q&A lines during witness examinations. The solution addresses critical issues where witnesses and attorneys were not being properly identified, leading to unresolved Q. and A. speakers.

## Problem Statement

### Issues Identified
1. **Attorney Speaker Resolution**: Attorneys loaded from trial-metadata.json had NULL speakerId values in TrialAttorney records, preventing Q. speaker resolution
2. **Witness Detection**: Complex regex patterns failed on witness names with professional titles (Ph.D., Jr., etc.)
3. **Context Synchronization**: Witness and examination context not properly synchronized between Phase2Processor and ExaminationContextManager
4. **Data Loss**: Missing witness records resulted in thousands of unresolved A. speaker warnings

### Impact
- 725KB+ of warning logs with "Unable to resolve Q speaker" and "Unable to resolve A speaker" errors
- Missing speaker attribution for witness testimony
- Incomplete data for analysis and search

## Old Approach (Problems)

### 1. Complex Regex Patterns for Witness Detection
```typescript
// OLD: Complex patterns that failed on edge cases
witnessName: /^([A-Z][A-Z\s,'"\.\-]+?),?\s+(PLAINTIFF'?S?'?|DEFENDANT'?S?'?|DEFENSE)\s+WITNESS(?:ES)?(?:\s|,|$)/,
witnessNameAlternate: /^([A-Z][A-Z\s,'"\.\-]+?)\s*,\s*(PLAINTIFF'?S?'?|DEFENDANT'?S?'?|DEFENSE)\s+WITNESS(?:ES)?(?:\s|,|$)/,
```

**Problems:**
- Failed on names with titles: "JOHN BARRY, Ph.D., PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS"
- Required exact pattern matches
- Would skip witness entirely if name didn't match expected format

### 2. Missing Speaker Records for Attorneys
```typescript
// OLD: TrialAttorney records created with NULL speakerId
// When "BY MR. DOVEL:" was encountered, no speaker existed to link
```

### 3. No Context Synchronization
```typescript
// OLD: Phase2Processor and ExaminationContextManager maintained separate witness state
// Updates in one didn't reflect in the other
```

## New Approach (Solution)

### 1. Component Removal Method for Witness Parsing

**Core Principle**: Remove known components from the line, and whatever remains is the witness name.

```typescript
private parseWitnessLine(lineText: string): {
  witnessName: string;
  witnessCaller: 'PLAINTIFF' | 'DEFENDANT';
  swornStatus: SwornStatus;
} | null {
  // Check for witness indicators
  if (!lineText.includes('WITNESS')) {
    return null;
  }
  
  let workingText = lineText;
  let witnessCaller: 'PLAINTIFF' | 'DEFENDANT' | null = null;
  
  // Remove PLAINTIFF'S/DEFENDANT'S WITNESS
  if (workingText.match(/PLAINTIFF'?S?'?\s+WITNESS/i)) {
    witnessCaller = 'PLAINTIFF';
    workingText = workingText.replace(/PLAINTIFF'?S?'?\s+WITNESS(?:ES)?/gi, '');
  } else if (workingText.match(/DEFENDANT'?S?'?\s+WITNESS/i) || 
             workingText.match(/DEFENSE\s+WITNESS/i)) {
    witnessCaller = 'DEFENDANT';
    workingText = workingText.replace(/DEFENDANT'?S?'?\s+WITNESS(?:ES)?/gi, '');
    workingText = workingText.replace(/DEFENSE\s+WITNESS(?:ES)?/gi, '');
  }
  
  // Remove sworn status
  let swornStatus = SwornStatus.NOT_SWORN;
  if (workingText.match(/PREVIOUSLY\s+SWORN/i)) {
    swornStatus = SwornStatus.PREVIOUSLY_SWORN;
    workingText = workingText.replace(/PREVIOUSLY\s+SWORN/gi, '');
  } else if (workingText.match(/\bSWORN\b/i)) {
    swornStatus = SwornStatus.SWORN;
    workingText = workingText.replace(/\bSWORN\b/gi, '');
  }
  
  // Remove other examination-related text
  workingText = workingText.replace(/EXAMINATION\s*(CONTINUED)?/gi, '');
  workingText = workingText.replace(/DIRECT|CROSS|REDIRECT|RECROSS/gi, '');
  
  // Clean up and use whatever remains as the witness name
  workingText = workingText.replace(/[,;:\(\)]/g, ' ').trim();
  
  // ALWAYS return a witness if we found witness indicators
  if (!workingText) {
    workingText = "UNKNOWN WITNESS";
  }
  
  return { witnessName: workingText, witnessCaller, swornStatus };
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Speaker Creation for Attorneys

When encountering "BY MR. DOVEL:" lines, create or update speaker records:

```typescript
// In Phase2Processor.checkExaminingAttorney
if (!trialAttorney) {
  // Create new TrialAttorney with speaker
} else if (!trialAttorney.speaker) {
  // TrialAttorney exists but has no speaker (from metadata import)
  const dbSpeaker = await this.prisma.speaker.create({
    data: {
      trialId: this.context.trialId,
      speakerPrefix: attorneyPrefix,
      speakerHandle,
      speakerType: 'ATTORNEY'
    }
  });
  
  // Update existing TrialAttorney with speaker
  trialAttorney = await this.prisma.trialAttorney.update({
    where: { id: trialAttorney.id },
    data: { speakerId: dbSpeaker.id }
  });
}
```

### 3. Context Synchronization

Added methods to ExaminationContextManager to sync state:

```typescript
// New method to set witness from Phase2Processor
setCurrentWitnessFromSpeaker(speaker: any, witnessName: string, caller: 'PLAINTIFF' | 'DEFENDANT'): void {
  this.currentWitness = {
    name: witnessName,
    caller: caller === 'PLAINTIFF' ? 'PLAINTIFF' : 'DEFENDANT',
    speaker: speaker,
    swornStatus: 'NOT_SWORN'
  };
  this.witnessCalledBy = caller.toLowerCase() as 'plaintiff' | 'defense';
  
  if (speaker) {
    this.speakerRegistry.setCurrentWitness(speaker);
  }
}

// New method to set examination type
setExaminationType(type: ExaminationType | null): void {
  this.examinationType = type;
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/parsers/Phase2Processor.ts**
   - Added `parseWitnessLine()` method for robust witness parsing
   - Modified `checkWitnessCalled()` to use new parsing approach
   - Updated `checkExaminingAttorney()` to create/update speaker records
   - Added synchronization calls to ExaminationContextManager

2. **src/services/ExaminationContextManager.ts**
   - Added `setCurrentWitnessFromSpeaker()` method
   - Added `setExaminationType()` method
   - Improved logging for debugging

### Key Improvements

1. **Robustness**: System NEVER fails to create a witness record when witness indicators are detected
2. **Simplicity**: Component removal approach handles any name format
3. **Logging**: Warnings logged for unusual formats but still processed
4. **Fallback**: Uses "UNKNOWN WITNESS" placeholder if name extraction fails
5. **Synchronization**: All components stay in sync for proper Q/A resolution

## Results

### Before Fix
- Warning log size: 725,888 bytes
- "Unable to resolve Q speaker" errors: Hundreds
- "Unable to resolve A speaker" errors: Thousands
- Witnesses detected: 1 (ALEX NAZARI only)
- Statement events: 3,031

### After Fix
- Warning log size: 342 bytes (99.95% reduction!)
- "Unable to resolve Q speaker" errors: 0
- "Unable to resolve A speaker" errors: 0
- Witnesses detected: 3 (all witnesses including Ph.D. titles)
- Statement events: 3,055 (captured more Q&A)

## Testing

### Test Cases Covered
1. Standard witness format: "JOHN SMITH, PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS, SWORN"
2. Professional titles: "JOHN BARRY, Ph.D., PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS, PREVIOUSLY SWORN"
3. Multiple titles: "DR. JANE DOE, M.D., Ph.D., DEFENDANT'S WITNESS"
4. Nicknames: "QI 'PETER' LI, PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS"
5. Split lines: "RICHARD BLAHUT, Ph.D., DEFENDANTS' WITNESS, PREVIOUSLY" (sworn on next line)

### Verification Queries
```sql
-- Check witness records
SELECT * FROM "Witness" WHERE "trialId" = 1;

-- Check speaker resolution
SELECT COUNT(*) as unresolved 
FROM "Line" 
WHERE "speakerPrefix" IN ('Q.', 'A.') 
AND id NOT IN (SELECT "lineId" FROM "StatementEvent");

-- Check WitnessCalledEvent integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE "witnessId" IS NULL) as missing_witness,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE "attorneyId" IS NULL) as missing_attorney 
FROM "WitnessCalledEvent";
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simpler is Better**: Component removal approach is more robust than complex regex patterns
2. **Always Create Records**: Better to have imperfect data than missing data
3. **Synchronization is Critical**: Multiple components must stay in sync for proper resolution
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Support updating existing records when more information becomes available
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Log warnings for unusual cases but continue processing

## Future Considerations

1. **Name Parsing Enhancement**: Improve parsing of witness names into firstName, lastName, suffix components
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Add logic to detect and merge duplicate witness records
3. **Validation Reports**: Generate reports of unusual name formats for manual review
4. **Pattern Learning**: Collect unusual patterns to improve future parsing

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully resolves speaker attribution issues by:
- Using a robust component-removal approach for witness parsing
- Dynamically creating speaker records for attorneys
- Maintaining synchronized context across all components
- Prioritizing data capture over pattern perfection

This ensures complete speaker attribution throughout witness examinations, enabling accurate search and analysis of trial transcripts.
