10                 (In-Chambers Hearing.)

11                 THE COURT:     All right.   We're on the record.

12                 The Court is mindful that both parties have filed

13     objections to the preliminary jury -- preliminary jury

14     instruction that the Court intends to give to the jury

15     regarding the Defendants' Exhibit No. 2 and similar letters

16     from the Federal Highway Administration that have been

17     pre-admitted into evidence.       The Court has considered the

18     written objections of both Defendants and Plaintiff as set

19     forth in lengthy e-mails delivered to the Court.

20                 Counsel, I'm going to hand you a revised copy of

21     what the Court e-mailed to the parties giving you my initial

22     draft of the preliminary instructions.

23                 I have highlighted in yellow for you places that I

24     am now going to change.       I thought I had more of them.

25                 All right.     Four lines down from the beginning of

1      the instruction, I'm going to change ET-Plus guardrail to

2      guardrail in systems --

3                  MR. MANN:    In terminals.

4                  THE COURT:    -- in -- in terminals, I'm sorry, yes.

5                  And rather than say the Court does not find that

6      this letter would absolve the Defendants, I'm going to say

7      it does not in and of itself resolve the case.

8                  And then I'm going to change the next highlighted

9      area where the sentence is, this letter does not have

10     -- does have probative value or the Court would not have

11     pre-admitted it, but it does not necessarily resolve the

12     entire case.     I'm going to change the verbiage there.

13                 And then I'm going to change the language in the

14     sentence that begins second FHWA has no power to absolve

15     past violations, I'm going to add if any, which is an

16     addition.

17                 And then on the paragraph that begins, further,

18     and if you find the Defendants did violate the False Claim

19     Act, five or six lines down, the sentence that begins the

20     Federal Highway Administration's letter, rather than may be,

21     I'm going to say is some evidence, but not necessarily

22     conclusive evidence.      I'm going to add the word necessarily.

23                 I'm going to make those changes in the preliminary

24     instruction.     I think those are well taken from the

25     objections raised, but all the other objections I've now

1      overruled.     What you have before you is the preliminary

2      instruction which I will give to the jury.

3                   Any questions?

4                   MR. MANN:     Your Honor, can I ask a question

5      either on or off the record?        It has nothing to do with an

6      objection, but what I want to --

7                   THE COURT:    If it has to do these objections,

8      let's get on the record.

9                   MR. MANN:     What I -- what I wanted to ask, if

10     it's appropriate, is -- or -- and you can tell me

11     appropriate or not, but where we can have some direction.

12     Are you -- I think what you're trying to say is, look, this

13     letter, I'm letting it in, it has probative value, but it

14     can't be considered any more than any other piece of

15     evidence.     It's just a piece of evidence.       And I'm -- I just

16     want to make sure we don't get into something where you go,

17     well, wait a minute, that's not what I'm saying.

18                  THE COURT:    Well, let's go off the record.

19                  (Off the record discussion.)

20                  THE COURT:    Let's go back on the record.

21     My preliminary instructions in a more general sense are

22     going to advise the jury that they must consider all of the

23     evidence before reaching any decision.

24                  MR. MANN:    Okay.

25                  THE COURT:    And I think that covers --

1                  MR. MANN:    Yes, sir.

2                  THE COURT:    -- the point you're concerned about.

3                  MR. MANN:    That answers it.

4                  THE COURT:    All right.    Are there any other

5      questions about my rulings on the objections from both sides

6      as to this preliminary jury instruction?

7                  Anything more from the Defendants?

8                  MR. MANN:    No, Your Honor.

9                  THE COURT:    Anything from the Plaintiff?

10                 MR. WARD:    I'm just trying to see all that's

11     changed.    No, Your Honor, I don't have any.

12                 THE COURT:    All right.    Then that will be the

13     Court's ruling.     The other matters we discussed this morning

14     in chambers, we'll take up after the jury is selected.            And

15     I'll excuse you at this time to rejoin your trial teams in

16     the courtroom.

17                 MR. MANN:    Thank you, Your Honor.

22                 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.        Thank you for

23     being here this morning.

24                 My name is Rodney Gilstrap, and I am the resident

25     United States District Judge in the Marshall Division of the
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 7 of 135 PageID #: 15892

1      Eastern District of Texas.       I've lived in Marshall since

2      1981.    I practiced law here for about 30 years, and I've

3      been on the bench since 2011.

4                  I was born in Florida, but as they say, I got to

5      Texas as quickly as I could.        I went to college and to law

6      school at Baylor University.        I'm married.    I have two grown

7      children.    And my wife owns and operates a retail floral

8      business here in Marshall.

9                  Now, I tell you all those things because in a few

10     minutes I'm going to ask you to each give me the same type

11     of information about yourselves, and I think you're entitled

12     to know as much about me as I'm about to find out about each

13     of y'all.

14                 We're about to engage in the selection of a jury

15     in a civil case.     However, before we go any further, I want

16     to briefly review with you how we came to have jury trials

17     and have a jury trial system in this country.          If you look

18     around the room, you will see that there's a diverse mixture

19     of our East Texas community here today.         That's how our

20     system was designed, and that's how it's supposed to be.

21                 If you study the first five books of the Old

22     Testament, you will find that in antiquity, the Hebrew

23     nation impaneled juries to answer questions of property

24     ownership and property value.        The Greeks began using a jury

25     system about 1500 years before Christ.         The Romans adopted

1      the jury system from the Greeks.        The Romans brought the

2      jury system to England in about the 4th century AD.            By the

3      12th century AD, jury trials had been a part of the judicial

4      system in England for over 800 years.

5                  About that time, a tyrannical king named King John

6      attempted to do away with the right to trial by jury in

7      England, and his nobles stood up to him and said no.            This

8      took place in a meadow called Runnymede, and from that, we

9      got the Magna Carta signed, guaranteeing citizens in England

10     the right to trials by jury.

11                 Twenty-eight of our United States have adopted

12     that same language from the Magna Carta, guaranteeing the

13     right to trial by jury verbatim and including it -- included

14     it in their state constitutions.

15                 The concept of jury trials was engrained in our

16     Founding Fathers as colonists in settling America.           Then in

17     the latter half of the 1700s, another British king, George

18     the III, attempted to deny citizens in these United States,

19     the American colonies, the right to trial by jury.

20                 Thomas Jefferson, in enumerating the various

21     complaints of the colonists against the British Crown in

22     what was entitled the Declaration of Independence,

23     specifically set out the denial of the right to a trial by

24     jury as one of the fundamental grounds mandating the

25     separation between England and the colonies and giving birth

1      to the United States.

2                  Ladies and gentlemen, the United States of America

3      is the only country in the world that guarantees the right

4      to a trial by jury in a civil case such as this.           This is

5      provided for in our Seventh Amendment to the Constitution.

6                  Certain other countries guarantee their citizens,

7      like the citizens in Great Britain or the United Kingdom,

8      the right to a trial by jury in a criminal case.           But only

9      in the United States is each and every citizen entitled to

10     and guaranteed the right constitutionally to have their

11     disputes settled in a civil action before a jury of their

12     peers.

13                 So in a very real way, each of you who are here

14     today reporting for jury service are doing your part as

15     ordinary American citizens to preserve, protect, and defend

16     the Constitution of our country.

17                 I want you to remember as we go through this

18     process today that this morning, no citizens were summoned

19     for jury duty in Castro's Cuba, the People's Republic of

20     China, or the Ayatollah's Iran.        I always tell jury panels,

21     and I firmly believe it each time I say it, that in my

22     opinion, jury service by ordinary citizens is the second

23     highest form of public service any American can perform.

24                 Of course, the highest form of public service are

25     those young men and women that serve in our armed forces and

1      protect our rights and our freedoms by putting their lives

2      on the line each day.

3                  Now, when the lawyers address you this morning,

4      they're going to ask you various questions.          I want you to

5      understand they are not seeking to inquire into your private

6      affairs unduly.     They're entitled to ask questions to help

7      secure a fair and impartial jury in this case.

8                  I don't know if it will happen today, but

9      sometimes members of a jury panel such as this are asked a

10     question that that particular person who's asked the

11     question believes is so personal and so private to them

12     individually that they are not comfortable answering the

13     question in front of the entire panel.

14                 That doesn't happen often, but it could happen;

15     and if it does happen, you have the right to answer that

16     question outside the entire panel.        And if you will just say

17     at that point you'd like to discuss that with Judge

18     Gilstrap, I'll make arrangements where you can answer that

19     question outside the presence of everybody else in the room.

20                 However, that is a rarity, and it should be used

21     for the most private and most personal matters that

22     otherwise you just could not feel comfortable answering in

23     front of everyone else.

24                 The important thing for each of you this morning

25     is that you give full, complete, and truthful answers to the
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 11 of 135 PageID #: 15896

11  




1      questions that are asked.       Remember, there are no wrong

2      answers to the questions as long as the answers you give are

3      full, complete, and truthful.

4                  The trial in this case, the beginning of the

5      evidence will begin after lunch today.          And I expect this

6      trial will last until Monday or maybe even Tuesday of next

7      week.   It will be all this week, and the first day or two of

8      next week to the best of my belief.          So if any of you have

9      any prepaid, non-refundable vacations and airline tickets,

10     if any of you have -- yourself or immediate member of your

11     family a serious surgical procedure that can't be

12     rescheduled, or if there are any other reasons why you could

13     not be present through this week and the beginning of next

14     week, if you're selected to serve on this jury, you need to

15     let me know that now, and you need to do that by raising

16     your hands.

17                 Okay.   And please keep them up until I get these

18     numbers written down.

19                 No. 1, No. 5, No. 12, No. 14, 21, and 20...

20                 JUROR KYLE:    -- 8.

21                 THE COURT:    28.   Thank you.

22                 All right.    I see no other hands.      Did I miss

23     anybody?

24                 Good.   We'll have an opportunity to talk about

25     those specifics later, but I wanted to make a note at this

1      time.

2                  All right.    I'm now going to call for

3      announcements in the case of United States America Ex Rel

4      Joshua Harman versus Trinity Industries and Trinity Highway

5      Products, LLC.     This is Civil Case No. 2:12-CV-89.

6                  And, Counsel, when you give your announcements,

7      please identify all the members of your trial team that are

8      present and will be participating in the trial as well as

9      any company representatives that you have with you.

10                 What says the Plaintiff?

11                 MR. WARD:    Thank you, Your Honor.

12                 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.        I'm John Ward

14     Mr. Joshua Harman.

15                 Mr. Harman, would you stand up so the

1      trial, Your Honor.       And we are ready to proceed.

2                  THE COURT:     Thank you, Counsel.

3                  What says the Defendants?

4                  MR. SHAW:     Your Honor, Ethan Shaw on behalf of

5      Trinity Industries and Trinity Highway Products, and we also

6      are ready to proceed.

7                  I'm here today assisted in this particular case as

8      the lawyers that will be participating in the case, Mr. Mark

9      Mann, Mr. Mike Miller, Mr. Russell Brown, Ms. Wendy West

10     Feinstein, Sarah Teachout, and Heather New.

11                 Your Honor, also here with us today is the

12     representative of Trinity Highway Products, Mr. Gregg

13     Mitchell, who is the president of Trinity Highway Products.

14                 We likewise are ready to proceed, Your Honor.

15                 THE COURT:     Thank you.

16                 Ladies and gentlemen, you may have noticed

17     that when I called for announcements in this case, I

18     noted the case is styled United States of America Ex Rel

19     Joshua Harman versus Trinity Industries and Trinity

20     Highway Products.       That's because this is a false claims

21     case.

22                 The False Claims Act prohibits the submission of a

23     false or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States

24     Government.    To enforce this prohibition, the False Claims

25     Act permits a private citizen, called a relator, to bring
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 14 of 135 PageID #: 15899

14  




1      and prosecute actions in the name and for the benefit of the

2      United States Government.       The private relator acts as the

3      Plaintiff for purposes of pursuing the lawsuit.

4                   The False Claims Act also allows for the relator

5      acting as the Plaintiff to collect and be paid between 25

6      percent and 30 percent of any monies recovered in a False

7      Claims Act trial such as this.

8                   In this case, the relator or the Plaintiff, is

9      Joshua Harman, who you've been introduced to.          For the sake

10     of consistency and to avoid any confusion, though

11     technically under this statute Mr. Harman is designated as a

12     relator, for purposes of simplicity and consistency, we are

13     going to refer to Mr. Harman throughout the trial as the

14     Plaintiff.

15                  But I wanted you to have that explanation, even

16     though he is technically called a relator.         That's such an

17     unusual word.     We're simply going to call him the Plaintiff

18     throughout this trial.

19                  The -- the Defendant in this case are Trinity

20     Industries and its subsidiary, Trinity Highway Products,

21     LLC, who we'll also refer to collectively as Trinity or as

22     the Defendants.

23                  Defendants are in the business, among other

24     things, of manufacturing various highway safety products and

25     construction products for use across the United States as
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 15 of 135 PageID #: 15900

15  




1      part of our National Highway System.        This case centers

2      around the Defendants' sale of guardrail end caps sometimes

3      referred to as a guardrail end terminal.         Trinity

4      specifically produces a product of this type that is called

5      the ET-Plus.

6                  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated the

7      False Claims Act by fraudulently enticing the United States

8      Government to pay for ET-Plus end terminals that were

9      substantially different in dimension and geometry from the

10     end terminals that were crash-tested in 2005 and approved

11     and accepted for use in 2005 from the Federal Highway

12     Administration.

13                 The Federal Highway Administration, or you will

14     often hear that agency in this trial referred to as the

15     FHWA -- the Federal Highway Administration is a part of the

16     United States Department of Transportation and is an agency

17     of the United States Government.

18                 In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants

19     falsely certified two various states through their state

20     highway departments that the ET-Plus terminals for which

21     these states sought federal reimbursement were the same as

22     the terminals that were crash-tested in 2005 and accepted

23     for use by the Federal Highway Administration.

24                 Defendants deny Plaintiff's allegations and state

25     that Trinity stands by the continuous acceptance of the
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 16 of 135 PageID #: 15901

16  




1      ET-Plus product.     Defendants maintain that the FHWA, Federal

2      Highway Administration, with the full knowledge of

3      Plaintiff's allegations, has confirmed multiple times that

4      the ET-Plus has been continuously accepted and approved for

5      reimbursement with federal funds from September the 2nd,

6      2005 to the present.

7                  Defendants assert that they never knowingly made

8      any false representations about the ET-Plus condition or

9      acceptance for federal reimbursement.         Defendants also

10     assert that the U.S. Government has suffered no harm or no

11     damages because the Government has always received and

12     continues to receive full value for what it pays for.

13                 Now, what you've just heard is a very informal way

14     of describing the case in layman's terms.         The lawyers on

15     both sides are about to question you, the panel, and they

16     will each attempt to gather information from you in order to

17     properly exercise their challenges to the panel, their

18     strikes as they're called, to complete the process of

19     selecting fair and impartial jurors that will try this case.

20                 Again, ladies and gentlemen, there are no wrong

21     answers to the questions you're about to be asked as long as

22     the answers you give are full, complete, and

23     truthful -- truthful responses to what you've been asked.

24                 The lawyers and their clients are entitled to the

25     information to be gained through these questions, and as I
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 17 of 135 PageID #: 15902

17  




1      mentioned earlier, the lawyers are not trying to unduly pry

2      into your private affairs.       They're here to gather this

3      information so that the jury selected can and will be fair

4      and impartial.     And that's the same reason for which each of

5      you filled out a questionnaire this morning when you

6      reported for jury duty and answered those questions.           That

7      will save us some time this morning with the remainder of

8      the questions.

9                   If I don't think the lawyers are entitled to ask a

10     question that they ask, I will certainly tell them so.           But

11     these are all experienced lawyers.        They know the rules of

12     this Court.     They're familiar with the Federal Rules of

13     Civil Procedure, and I'm confident they're going to stay

14     within those rules.     If they don't, I will certainly let

15     them know.

16                  One thing I want to call your attention to,

17     though, before the lawyers begin to ask any questions,

18     because some of the lawyers may ask you about that in their

19     questions that they pose to the panel, and that is the

20     burden of proof to be applied in this case.

21                  In this case, the jury that's actually selected,

22     sworn, and impaneled will be called upon to apply a burden

23     of proof known as a preponderance of the evidence.           I need

24     to instruct you that when a party has the burden of proof on

25     any claim or defense by a preponderance of the evidence, it
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 18 of 135 PageID #: 15903

18  




1      means that you, the jury, must be persuaded by the credible

2      or believable evidence that the claim or defense is more

3      probably true than not true.       I'll say that again:      More

4      probably true than not true.

5                  Sometimes we talk about that as being the greater

6      weight and degree of credible evidence.

7                  Let me give you an example, ladies and gentlemen.

8      I think all of you from where you're seated can see the

9      statue of the Lady of Justice that is positioned in front of

10     our court reporter.     You'll notice a couple of important

11     things about this very important statue.         She's blindfolded,

12     because justice should be blind.        She holds in her right

13     hand the sword of justice to enforce the judgments of this

14     Court.    But she holds raised in her left hand the scales of

15     justice, and that's what I want you to focus on.

16                 Those scales of justice are equally balanced,

17     exactly side-by-side; not one bit of difference between

18     them.    I want you to consider that during the course of this

19     trial, the evidence presented by both sides will be placed

20     on those scales.     And when the evidence is complete, you'll

21     be asked to answer certain questions.         And in answering

22     those questions, you should consider the evidence placed on

23     those scales.    And if those scales tip in one direction or

24     another, then that direction is the answer that has been

25     shown by a preponderance of the evidence.
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 19 of 135 PageID #: 15904

19  




1                  Even if those scales tip even ever so slightly, it

2      is the greater weight and degree of credible evidence; more

3      likely true than not true.       That is the preponderance of the

4      evidence.

5                  Now, the preponderance of the evidence burden of

6      proof is in no way to be confused with what you may have

7      heard in the public or the media or in the television or in

8      the movies known as beyond a reasonable doubt.          Beyond a

9      reasonable doubt is a burden of proof that is used in

10     criminal cases.     It has no application in a civil case like

11     this.

12                 But I give you these instructions about the burden

13     of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, because it's

14     quite likely that some of the lawyers in this case will ask

15     you as part of their questions whether you are comfortable

16     and willing and able to apply that burden to the evidence

17     that you hear in this case.

18                 Now, before the lawyers begin with their specific

19     questions, this is the time when each of you are going to

20     get to answer for me the questions that I answered for you

21     when we first started this morning.        Each of you should have

22     a list of those nine questions, and we are going to do this

23     one at a time starting with Panel Member No. 1, and the

24     Court Security Officer, Mr. McAteer, is going to hand you a

25     handheld microphone.
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 20 of 135 PageID #: 15905

20  




1                  It's important that you stand whenever you answer

2      these questions or any question that either of the lawyers

3      ask you this morning.      It's important that you not speak

4      until you get the handheld microphone.         This is a large

5      courtroom with a lot of people, and it's very important that

6      everyone is heard, especially the court reporter who will

7      write down every answer to every question.          So do not answer

8      or respond until you have the handheld microphone.            And be

9      sure that you stand whenever you respond to these questions

10     or any other questions.

11                 All right.    That -- then we'll start with Panel

12     Member No. 1.    Ms. Chandler, if you'll stand and answer

13     those nine questions for us.

14                 JUROR CHANDLER:     My name is Christina Chandler.          I

15     live in Gilmer, Texas.       I have two children.     I'm a

16     full-time med student at Vista College in Longview, Texas.

17     I have been there for a little bit over a year.          I do not

18     work at the time.     I am divorced; therefore, I do not have a

19     spouse.    And I have never participated in a jury case

20     before.

21                 THE COURT:    All right.    Mr. Milford, you're next.

22                 JUROR MILFORD:     Yeah, my name is Randy Milford.

23     And I have two kids.      I live in Hallsville.      I work at

24     Archer Wireline Service which is an oilfield service

25     company.    Been there for 10 years as a district manager.

1      And I graduated from Pine Tree High School.           That's all the

2      education I got.     And my back -- wife's name is Becky.           And

3      she's a medical pathologist -- or works for a medical

4      pathologist doctor in Longview.        And she's been there about

5      a year.     She did medical transcription before that.        Never

6      been on a -- selected for service on a jury before.

7                   THE COURT:   Thank you, sir.

8                   JUROR SCHREIBER:     Name is Justin Schreiber.        I've

9      got one child.     I live in Marshall, Texas.      I work for

10     General Cable as a CVA operator.        Been there about 15 years.

11     I've got some college background.        Wife's name is Kim.        She

12     works for the pharmacies in Longview at the hospitals.

1                  All right.    Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very

2      much.   I now need to say just a couple additional things to

3      you before I turn the questioning over to the lawyers.

4                  The jurors that are actually selected from this

5      panel and that serve as the jury in this case will serve in

6      the role of the judges of the facts.        The jury selected will

7      make the sole determination about what the facts are in this

8      case.   Now, my job as the Judge is to rule on questions of

9      law, evidence, procedure, and to control the decorum of the

10     courtroom and the flow of the trial.

11                 Also, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say a couple

12     of things to you about our American judicial system that I

13     hope will put things in a proper perspective for those of

14     you that are selected to serve on this jury.

15                 In my view, in a jury trial -- in every jury

16     trial, there are always three participants:          The jurors, the

17     judge, and the lawyers.      It's important for each of you to

18     understand that our American judicial system is an adversary

19     system, which means simply that during trials such as this,

20     each of the parties will seek to present their respective

21     cases to the jury in the very best light possible.

22                 Now, lawyers are often criticized in the public in

23     the media, and the Court has observed that some of this

24     criticism is the result of a basic misunderstanding about

25     our adversary system in which the lawyers act as advocates
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 34 of 135 PageID #: 15919

34  




1      for the competing parties.       As an advocate, a lawyer is

2      ethically and legally obligated to zealously assert his or

3      her client's position under the rules of the system.           And by

4      presenting the best case possible on behalf of their

5      clients, the lawyers hopefully will enable the jury to

6      better weigh the relevant evidence and determine the truth

7      and arrive at a just verdict based on that evidence.           This

8      system has served our country well for over 200 years, and

9      America's lawyers continue to be a critical part of that

10     process.

11                 Also, ladies and gentlemen, as we go forward

12     during the trial, it is possible that time -- from time to

13     time you may see me frown or roll my eyes or occasionally

14     growl at the lawyers.      It's just because I'm trying to make

15     sure that their advocacy stays within the boundaries of our

16     adversary system and our rules of procedure and conduct.

17                 But please keep in mind, they are just doing their

18     jobs, and I think it's important for all of you to be aware

19     of that as we go forward.

20                 Also, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know

21     that during the trial, I will do my best not to give you any

22     idea of how I personally feel about the evidence that's

23     introduced during this trial because it's the job of the

24     jury and not the job of the Judge in a trial such as this to

25     determine what the facts are from the evidence.          So you

1      should not take any expressions that you see from me as

2      something to consider in making your decisions about what

3      the ultimate facts are in this case.

4                  All right.    With that, we'll now hear from lawyers

5      for each of the parties in this case.

6                  Mr. Ward, you may address the panel on behalf of

7      the Plaintiff.     Would you like a warning on your time?

8                  MR. WARD:    Yes, Your Honor, if you would give me a

9      five-minute and a two-minute.

10                 THE COURT:     Yes, sir, we will.     You may proceed.

11                 MR. WARD:    Thank you, Your Honor.

12                 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.         I want to say

13     -- first, I want to thank you very much for being here.            We

14     all know that we're taking you away from some very important

15     time for your own personal business and your own affairs to

16     help resolve this dispute.       And we very much appreciate your

17     service.    I don't know that I could in any way say anything

18     that Judge Gilstrap hadn't already said, but just to say

19     that he said it as good as you can say, how great the jury

20     system is and how much it means to this country and how much

21     you are doing by being here and preserve, protect, and

22     defending our Constitution.

23                 I've been introduced.      I'm John Ward.     I've been a

24     lawyer here in East Texas since 1968.         You'll always be able

25     to figure out who -- who I am because I'm the oldest one up

1      here on any team.     I practice law presently with my son over

2      in Longview, Johnny, it's his law firm.         And I am going to

3      introduce you to Kurt Truelove, Josh Maness from Marshall,

4      and then from the Boies Schiller & Flexner firm, I have

5      George Carpinello, Karen Dyer, Nick Gravante, and we're

6      representing Mr. Harman, who the Judge has described to you

7      as a relator.     We'll refer to him hereafter as just the

8      Plaintiff.

9                   Now, His Honor has told you this is a False Claims

10     Act.   Before I talk anything to you about a -- the -- the

11     case, I'd like to talk to you first about voir dire.             This

12     is the only time that we get to have any type of

13     conversation with you where there will be a question and

14     answer.   And in the years that I've been doing this, one of

15     the things I've learned is that sometimes potential jurors

16     think, well, one way I can avoid getting on a jury is just

17     not to say anything, sort of fly under the radar.           Or

18     sometimes jurors are concerned that they might say -- might

19     give a wrong answer.      Of course, Your Honor has already

20     covered this and said there are no wrong answers in

21     this -- at this stage, and I just want to say, please

22     remember what he said about that.

23                  I just want to say that based on my -- some 47

24     years, it's not saying anything, actually probably makes it

25     more likely that you're going to get selected, because after
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 37 of 135 PageID #: 15922

37  




1      both sides have spoken to you, they have just a little bit

2      of time to go back and make our choices.         And so we get back

3      there and everybody's talking and said, well, what about

4      Juror No. -- No. 7 there?       And he says, well, Mr. Cook

5      didn't say anything, well, he's probably on our side, you

6      know, so we take -- always take Mr. Cook.          So I just

7      encourage you to -- if I ask you a question, please, please

8      respond to me.

9                  I know all of you came in this courtroom today

10     with your wanting to be fair and impartial if you got

11     selected in this case.      But I want you to simply think about

12     some things that -- you know, all of us have different life

13     experiences that affect the way we may look at different

14     cases, may look at evidence, how we may feel about the whole

15     judicial system, about jury trials, and things like that.

16     And I want to try to see if you're leaning one way or the

17     other without hearing any evidence in this case because of

18     these life experiences.

19                 Let me give you a couple examples of what I'm

20     talking about.     Over 50 years ago, I met my wife while we

21     were attending Texas Tech.       We got married.     Both of us

22     graduated from Texas Tech.       And my wife went on back -- few

23     years back and served a seven-year term on the Board of

24     Regents at Texas Tech.      I'm presently active in the

25     ex-students or alumni association.        I tell you, I wouldn't
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 38 of 135 PageID #: 15923

38  




1      be a very fair juror if Texas Tech was -- if somebody was

2      against Texas Tech because I'd just be leaning that way

3      because of my life experiences.        And, you know, I think of a

4      juror sometimes as more being like a baseball umpire -- an

5      analogy -- in the sense that jurors -- as His Honor said,

6      you determine the credibility and the believability of the

7      witnesses, so you sort of have to call the balls and strikes

8      as that witness is testifying.       And so that's an analogy I

9      like to think about.

10                 You know, another example is my mother was a

11     school teacher for over 45 years in the public school

12     system.   One of my -- my youngest son, my other son, he

13     is -- he taught school for about 12 years.         And then my

14     daughter-in-law, she's a school teacher.         I don't think I'd

15     be very fair as a juror calling balls and strikes in

16     something -- any type of matter against a school teacher.

17                 So I use that because I feel like I'd leaning on

18     their side.

19                 Now, inside the courtroom, we talk about leanings

20     in legal terms of bias or prejudice.        No one outside this

21     courtroom -- and I'm going to admit that I would be biased

22     or prejudiced.     That's just not words we use describing

23     ourselves, but inside this courtroom, I'd have to say I'd be

24     biased in favor of or prejudiced in favor of the school

25     teacher or Texas Tech.

39  




1                   So -- now, that's what I'm trying to do is

2      determine how -- if you have any leaning.         I'm going to say

3      just a few more things about the False Claims Act.           You

4      know, as -- first passed over 150 years ago.          Sometimes that

5      case -- the False Claims Act is referred to as a

6      whistleblower case, and it provides a mechanism where a

7      citizen can file a lawsuit, recover money from a company

8      such as the Defendants in this case by proving that they

9      violated the terms of the False Claims Act.

10                  Now, as His Honor said, Mr. Harman would receive

11     between 25 and 30 percent of the recovery.         The actual

12     percentage is determined by His Honor.         But what I -- you

13     know, it's -- that's the way the False Claims Act is set up

14     to encourage people to expose fraud.        And the device that is

15     central to this case is a safety device.         It's a terminal

16     head, and they're installed on the nation's highways.

17                  You'll see many of them.

18                  If you'd call up that Exhibit 1 for me,

19     Mr. Calzaretta.

20                  That's the device.    You may have never noticed

21     this, but I think you'll notice them after you hear about

22     this case.     They're all over the highways in East Texas,

23     interstate highways, Highway 59, lots of highways.           So what

24     you'll learn in this case -- we believe that you'll see that

25     the Federal Government is paid out over $200 millions in
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 40 of 135 PageID #: 15925

40  




1      reimbursement to the states.       And we believe this money was

2      paid out in violation -- as a result of violation of the

3      False Claims Act by Trinity.

4                  So we're talking about a very large amount of

5      money that we're seeking to recover.        It's approximately

6      $218 million.

7                  Now, Mr. Harman is the first person to discover

8      some of Trinity's fraud, and he brought it to the attention

9      of the Federal Highway Administration in 2012.          But make no

10     mistake about it, he has a financial interest in this case.

11     He has a partnership business with his brother, Mr. Chris

12     Harman.   And that company is in bankruptcy, and he plans, if

13     he is successful in this lawsuit, to use part of that money

14     to refinance his company and bring it out of bankruptcy.

15                 Now, I tell you that, unfortunately in this case,

16     that Mr. Chris Harman improperly deleted some e-mails from

17     his personal and business account, and the Judge has said

18     it's improper, and the Judge has told us that he's going to

19     give -- in the final instructions that he's going to give

20     you what is sometimes referred to as an adverse

21     interest -- inference charge.

22                 And he will tell you that the jury -- I don't know

23     exactly what he'll say, but whatever he says, that's what

24     you must follow.     But I'll just give you an idea that you

25     may or should infer that those e-mails that were deleted
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 41 of 135 PageID #: 15926

41  




1      were adverse to the interest of Mr. Chris Harman, and

2      perhaps Mr. Josh Harman.

3                  But I just wanted to tell you that that's part of

4      the case.

5                  Now, I do want to tell you that we rely solely on

6      the conduct of Trinity Industries, their agents, and

7      employees and the FHW -- the Federal Highway Administration

8      documents to prove our case, because Mr. Harman, although he

9      discovered some things and brought it to the attention, his

10     testimony does not go to establish the elements of a

11     violation of the Federal Highway Administration.

12                 I'll later, when we make opening statements, it's

13     probably going to be this afternoon or maybe a little before

14     lunch, I'll go in much more detail on that.

15                 THE COURT:    Let's move on to specific questions,

16     Counsel.

17                 MR. WARD:    Yes, sir.

18                 How many of you agree with this statement:         There

19     are too many lawsuits?      Anybody?    If y'all agree with that,

20     please raise -- I think there are too many lawsuits.

21                 How many of you agree that some are frivolous

22     Anybody dis -- some are frivolous?

23                 Well, I think some are frivolous.        For instance,

24     somebody that's incarcerated in the state prison system

25     files a lawsuit for crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 42 of 135 PageID #: 15927

42  




1      peanut butter.       I think there are lawsuits like that and

2      they're frivolous.

3                   How many of you -- is there anybody on the

4      panel -- I would like you to raise your hand.           Does

5      any -- those that might feel that most lawsuits are

6      frivolous?     Does anybody feel that way?

7                   All right.     That's Juror No. 5.

8                   And who else?     12?

9                   Okay.    Thank you.

10                  All right.     And Mr. -- Mr. -- is it Mr. Thomas?

11     You said that you felt like most lawsuits are frivolous?

12                  JUROR THOMAS:         Yes, sir.

13                  MR. WARD:     Okay.     Just sort of give me an idea why

14     you feel that way.        Do you mind?

15                  JUROR THOMAS:     I'm not sure.     That's what I think.

16                  MR. WARD:     Just a feeling?

17                  JUROR THOMAS:     Yes, sir.

18                  MR. WARD:     Okay.     Thank you very much.

19                  And then Ms. -- thank you, sir.        Is it Ms. Head?

20                  JUROR HEAD:     Yes.     It's just that so many lawsuits

21     that I hear about just make no sense.

22                  MR. WARD:     Okay.

23                  JUROR HEAD:     You know, it's negligence on someone

24     else's part, but they want to blame someone else just to get

25     money.   And I just -- I don't hear about all lawsuits, but

1      that's what I mostly hear about.

2                  MR. WARD:     All right.     Ms. -- Ms. Head, you know,

3      in -- and there's some people that feel like the whole civil

4      justice system needs to be reformed, and I see billboards

5      about East Texans Against Lawsuit Abuse and things like

6      that.

7                  Have you ever been active in any organization like

8      that?

9                  JUROR HEAD:     No.

10                 MR. WARD:     What about anyone else on the panel?

11     Anybody else -- thank you so much.          Has anyone else ever

12     been active or been a member of or their employer of East

13     Texans Against Lawsuit Abuse or any other group that's

14     attempting to reform the entire civil justice system?

15                 Thank you very much.

16                 I believe we have some folks that have been a

17     defendant in a lawsuit.       Would you raise your hands, please.

18     I thought I saw that on a questionnaire.

19                 Okay.   Yes, ma'am.     That's Ms. Green?

20                 JUROR SUE GREEN:      Yes.

21                 MR. WARD:     Okay.

22                 JUROR SUE GREEN:      Yes.    Our family were part of a

23     class action lawsuit against the state of Oklahoma in a case

24     that had to do with college entrance scores and

25     ethnicity-based qualifications for a state-issued

1      scholarship.

2                   MR. WARD:   And is there anything about that

3      experience that would affect you in sitting in this case?

4                   JUROR SUE GREEN:      I don't believe so.

5                   MR. WARD:   You could be perfectly fair and

6      impartial to my client, who is proceeding as a Plaintiff in

7      this case?

8                   JUROR SUE GREEN:      I think I could.

9                   MR. WARD:   Okay.     Thank you very much.

10                  Well, was that matter resolved to your

11     satisfaction?

12                  JUROR SUE GREEN:      It was.

13                  MR. WARD:   Okay.     Thank you.

14                  Other than you yourself being a -- in a lawsuit,

15     have any of you, through your employment where your employer

16     got sued, but it was because of something that you knew

17     about or you were involved in a lawsuit, anybody like that

18     on the panel?

19                  Okay.   Juror No. 17 there, Mr. Salazar?

20                  JUROR SALAZAR:      Yeah.   This was back in the '80s

21     about a buried cable underneath a foundation for a

22     residence.     And the company was sued, and I was first

23     responder to try to fix the cable.

24                  MR. WARD:   Oh, okay.

25                  JUROR SALAZAR:      So I had to attend court and be a

1      witness.

2                   MR. WARD:   All right.        Anything about that

3      experience that you think might influence you in this case?

4                   JUROR SALAZAR:      No, other than I thought the guy

5      kind of -- some of the things he put out there was a little

6      bit, you know, farfetched.

7                   MR. WARD:   Well, would you start off leaning one

8      way or the other in this case?

9                   JUROR SALAZAR:      No.     I mean, I'd just have to

10     listen to the evidence and go from there.

11                  MR. WARD:   All right.        That's all we can ask you

12     to do.     Thank you very much, sir.

13                  Was it Mr. Sweeten?

14                  JUROR SWEETEN:      Yes.     The company I used to work

15     with had a bankruptcy and some of the employees, I believe,

16     sued for lost wages or something.            And then I had to -- some

17     of my backups I had to keep for another something or other,

18     but I never heard anything about it other than keeping the

19     backups.

20                  MR. WARD:   Anything about that experience that

21     would influence you one way or the other in this case?

22                  JUROR SWEETEN:      No.

23                  MR. WARD:   Have no influence whatsoever?

24                  JUROR SWEETEN:      None.

25                  MR. WARD:   Okay.     Thank you, sir.

1                  And then I believe we had -- is it Mr. Oxsheer.

2                  JUROR OXSHEER:    Yes.   I worked for Pfizer

3      Pharmaceuticals for about 18 years prior to this, and I was

4      actually named in a -- as a defendant in a court case

5      alleging that Celebrex had harmed a patient, and that they

6      accused me misrepresenting Celebrex to a physician, who also

7      was named in the -- in the lawsuit.

8                  But the end result was that the Court was --I

9      mean, the case was thrown out.

10                 MR. WARD:   Well, did you have to give a deposition

11     in that case or anything?

12                 JUROR OXSHEER:    Yes.

13                 MR. WARD:   You think that that experience of

14     giving a deposition and being brought into the suit, would

15     that have any influence in this case?

16                 JUROR OXSHEER:    Possibly.

17                 MR. WARD:   Think that you would start off leaning

18     one way or the other in this case?

19                 JUROR OXSHEER:    No, I wouldn't say that.

20                 MR. WARD:   I just wonder what kind -- how would it

21     influence you, sir?

22                 JUROR OXSHEER:    It just -- I don't know.       It was

23     kind of one of those things when they throw a lot of stuff

24     on the wall to see what sticks.

25                 MR. WARD:   Well, you were a pharmaceutical detail

1      person for Pfizer?

2                  JUROR OXSHEER:    Yes, sir.

3                  MR. WARD:    Before I went to law school, I did that

4      for the Upjohn Company.

5                  JUROR OXSHEER:    Oh, okay.

6                  MR. WARD:    Thank you, sir.    I really appreciate

7      it.

8                  JUROR OXSHEER:    Uh-huh.

9                  MR. WARD:    Now, some people don't like the federal

10     whistleblower statute, and they just don't think that's

11     right.   And is there anybody here in this group of jurors

12     that have any problem with this concept that the Judge has

13     described to you, of an individual citizen being able to

14     file a whistleblower suit saying -- alleging that they're

15     exposing fraud and the fraud caused damage to the United

16     States Government?

17                 Anybody just say:     I don't like that kind of

18     lawsuit, and I'll sort of be leaning for Trinity Industries

19     to start with in this case?       Anybody in this group, this 14?

20                 All right.    Anybody over here to my left?

21                 Okay.   I take it by your silence, you're all

22     telling me that would have no effect on you, that I'm just

23     asking you you would have no problem in enforcing the law as

24     Judge Gilstrap explains it to you is the way I'm

25     understanding you.

1                  Now, the fact that Mr. Harman is going to

2      receive -- if he's successful -- if he's successful in this

3      case -- as much as 30 percent.          Is there -- not less than 25

4      nor more than 30.       Would that have any effect on

5      your -- anybody in this group here in the jury box by --

6      would you start out leaning toward Trinity just because of

7      the amount of money?

8                  We're talking about 30 percent of $218 million.

9      That's a lot of money.       Is there anybody that would -- would

10     be leaning against Trinity just because of the -- that

11     amount of money and the fact that Mr. Harman might receive

12     part of it?

13                 How about over here back to my left, any problem?

14     Yes, sir.     That's Juror No. 26, Mr. Fyffe.

15                 JUROR FYFFE:     Yes.     I'm not sure I fully

16     understood the question.       Are you asking would I be leaning

17     against Trinity because of it?

18                 MR. WARD:     Yes, sir.

19                 JUROR FYFFE:     I'd almost lean for them because of

20     it, because he's -- he's eligible to get money, to be honest

21     with you.

22                 MR. WARD:     Well, maybe I -- I misstated my

23     question.     You'd be leaning in favor of Trinity?

24                 JUROR FYFFE:     Probably, just because he is

25     eligible -- I have no problem with whistleblowers, but he's

1      wanting a reward.       Does that make sense?

2                  MR. WARD:     Yes, sir.   I understand what you're

3      saying.   Could you -- and you would start off -- would

4      that -- would that cause you some difficulty in --

5                  JUROR FYFFE:     I don't know that it'd cause me

6      difficulty.    I'd have to weigh the case real hard on this

7      side -- on your side.

8                  MR. WARD:     Well --

9                  JUROR FYFFE:     It would be some leaning toward the

10     other side.

11                 MR. WARD:     In attempting to call the balls and

12     strikes, you'd sort of be leaning against Mr. Harman?

13                 JUROR FYFFE:     It would be a tighter strike zone.

14                 MR. WARD:     That's one way of saying it.

15                 JUROR FYFFE:     That helps.

16                 MR. WARD:     I understand that.    Even though the

17     Judge told you everybody starts off equal, based -- just

18     because of the way you feel, your life experience, you feel

19     like Trinity starts off a little ahead.         Is that a fair

20     way --

21                 JUROR FYFFE:     They have a wider strike zone, using

22     your baseball terminology.

23                 MR. WARD:     Well, I just use that.     If you --

24                 JUROR FYFFE:     Right.   Yes.   They'd have a little

25     easier time, probably, starting off.

1                   MR. WARD:   Thank you, sir.

2                   JUROR FYFFE:   You're welcome.

3                   MR. WARD:   Anyone else that would agree with

4      Mr. Fyffe?     Anyone else feel that way?

5                   JUROR SUE GREEN:    Not exactly.

6                   MR. WARD:   Okay.

7                   JUROR SUE GREEN:    But I have a question.

8                   MR. WARD:   Yes, ma'am.

9                   JUROR SUE GREEN:    Maybe it was stated and I just

10     missed it, but I don't understand Mr. Harman's relationship

11     to Trinity to be in the position of being a whistleblower.

12                  MR. WARD:   Well, he never worked -- he discovered

13     the fraud.     He was a competitor of -- of Trinity Industries

14     in the manufacturing of the business.         He discovered the --

15     the fraud through a series of events that occurred.

16                  There was a -- a lawsuit between the parties at

17     one time that was settled to both of them's mutual

18     satisfaction.     But during that period of time, he made

19     discovery of certain facts, and then in 2012, he presented

20     it to the Federal Highway Administration.

21                  JUROR SUE GREEN:    Okay.   Thank you.

22                  MR. WARD:   Would that cause -- any of that cause

23     you any concern?

24                  JUROR SUE GREEN:    That clears it up more for me,

25     but I believe I could be impartial in listening to the facts

1      on both sides.

2                   MR. WARD:   You feel like you could be fair and

3      impartial?

4                   JUROR SUE GREEN:     Yes.

5                   MR. WARD:   Okay.    Thank you very much.

6      And Juror No. 1?

7                   JUROR CHANDLER:     I do personally feel that it --

8                   MR. WARD:   That's Ms. Chandler, correct?

9                   JUROR CHANDLER:     I'm sorry.   Yes.

10                  MR. WARD:   Okay.

11                  JUROR CHANDLER:     I do personally feel just because

12     of the reasoning of the case and the fact that there is such

13     a large amount of money at stake that it does kind of

14     put maybe his intentions at question as to how he got to

15     this point.

16                  MR. WARD:   Okay.

17                  JUROR CHANDLER:     That's just my personal opinion.

18                  MR. WARD:   It's got to be the right opinion in

19     this -- you know, that -- for you.        And thank you very much.

20     Do you think that would cause you some difficulty in calling

21     the balls and strikes, using my baseball analogy?

22                  JUROR CHANDLER:     I do think that it -- I do feel

23     like it automatically kind of leans me more toward's

24     Trinity's side starting off.

25                  MR. WARD:   Okay.    Thank you very much.

1                   Is there anybody else that would agree with Ms.

2      Chandler?

3                   Okay.   Juror No. 14, that's Mr. Surman.       Have I

4      got that right, Surman?

5                   JUROR SURMAN:      Yes, sir.

6                   MR. WARD:   Yes, sir?

8      of theirs?

9                   MR. WARD:   He was a competitor of theirs at one

10     time.

11                  JUROR SURMAN:      So he built the same product?

12                  MR. WARD:   Well, not the same product.      Same type

13     of product.

14                  JUROR SURMAN:      Same type of product.   Same safety

15     equipment?

16                  MR. WARD:   Same safety equipment, yes, sir.

17                  JUROR SURMAN:      Okay.

18                  MR. WARD:   And there was a lawsuit that

19     was settled between them.

20                  JUROR SURMAN:      Now, he's brought another one upon

21     them about if it's built properly, I guess is what it's

22     coming down to?

23                  MR. WARD:   Yes.     It was brought after that, after

24     he discovered certain facts and then brought those to the

25     attention of the Federal Highway Administration.

1                  JUROR SURMAN:    It's his second shot at it?

2                  MR. WARD:   No, sir.     They sued him the first time.

3                  JUROR SURMAN:    Okay.

4                  MR. WARD:   But the question is, Mr. Surman, would

5      this cause you to start off leaning in favor of Trinity?

6                  JUROR SURMAN:    Well, I would feel that he wasn't

7      satisfied the first time, so he found something else.

8                  MR. WARD:   That's where -- and well, is that --

9                  JUROR SURMAN:    I favor towards Trinity.

10                 MR. WARD:   Okay.    Well, I'm just trying -- and you

11     -- you would have to hear -- we start off a little behind in

12     the race, if we just use some analogy --

13                 JUROR SURMAN:    Somebody's got to, yeah.

14                 MR. WARD:   Well, you don't think they can both

15     start off even?     That's all I'm saying.

16                 Okay.   We'd start off a little behind.

17                 JUROR SURMAN:    Yes, sir.

18                 MR. WARD:   Okay, sir.

19                 Is there anybody on the panel that would agree

20     with Mr. Surman that because of this, that we would start

21     off somewhat behind?

22                 Okay.   Thank you very much, Mr. Surman.

23                 Now, the device that is the subject of this

24     lawsuit is a safety device known as a terminal head.           You've

25     been shown pictures of that.

1                   Let's throw it up that one more time if you would,

2      Mr. Calzaretta.

3                   There we go.

4                   I just want you to know that this particular

5      device -- how many of the -- when I show you that, how many

6      of the jurors, just seeing that, recall -- when you see

7      that, oh, yeah, that refreshes my mind; I've seen those

8      driving on the highways?

9                   Most of you recall that?     Okay.

10                  How many of the jurors in this case have some

11     affiliation with Texas A&M?

12                  Now, by that, I mean maybe you went to school

13     there; maybe you didn't graduate there, but you've got a --

14     either somebody in your family or close personal friend that

15     went there, or sometimes there are folks who just feel like

16     I'm a fighting Aggie, you know, and you've got some feelings

17     for Texas A&M?     Is anybody on this group?

18                  All right, sir.     Mr. Surman?

19                  JUROR SURMAN:     I worked construction for 10 years

20     on campus.     My wife had basically two semesters left to

21     graduate with a CPA, and we ended up pregnant with our first

22     born, so...

23                  MR. WARD:   Okay.    All right.   This device was

24     designed originally by Texas A&M.        Now, I want to make clear

25     that Texas A&M is not a party to this lawsuit, but it was

1      designed by a group of engineers that worked at the Texas

2      Transportation Institute.        You probably -- since you worked

3      there, you know exactly where it was located even.

4                  JUROR SURMAN:      Yes, sir.

5                  MR. WARD:   Yes.     And they have been very active in

6      helping Trinity in the defense of this case.              And they will

7      appear and testify in this case.           So knowing that, is there

8      anything about that that would cause you to lean a little

9      more toward Trinity or not?

10                 JUROR SURMAN:      Not really.        I've got two nephews

11     and two nieces graduated from A&M as well.              They're just

12     here to help the case for everybody, really.

13                 MR. WARD:   Well, it might be a little more than

14     that in this case in that there might be some direct

15     financial interest of the engineer and there were some $2

16     million in patent license fees that they obtained

17     during -- during the course of the -- because of the sale of

18     this.

19                 JUROR SURMAN:      I wouldn't -- nothing on me.

20                 MR. WARD:   Okay.        All right.     But you wouldn't

21     lean one way or the other?

22                 JUROR SURMAN:      No.

23                 MR. WARD:   That's good.        Thank you, sir.

24                 Is there anybody else, other than Mr. Surman, has

25     any close -- any connection with Texas A&M?

1                   All right, sir.        That's Juror No. 15, Mr. Windham?

2                   JUROR WINDHAM:        I've just got a grandson

3      attending.

4                   MR. WARD:     Just?

5                   JUROR WINDHAM:        As far as being partial, it

6      wouldn't make any difference.

7                   MR. WARD:     Wouldn't make any difference?

8                   JUROR WINDHAM:        No.

9                   MR. WARD:     You could be fair and impartial to both

10     sides?

11                  JUROR WINDHAM:        Sure.

12                  MR. WARD:     In fact, if their engineer came in, you

13     wouldn't start off saying:           I believe I'm going to give them

14     a little more credibility because of that?

15                  JUROR WINDHAM:        No.

16                  MR. WARD:     Thank you very much for telling me

17     that.

18                  Anyone else?

19                  Yes, ma'am.     That's back here on the back after --

20                  JUROR HUDGINS:        Can you hear me?

21                  MR. WARD:     Yes.     Ms. Hudgins?

22                  JUROR HUDGINS:        Okay.   As part of my job, I

23     arrange a college day every year.            And, of course, the

24     colleges that contact me back and -- and participate, I'm

25     partial to.     They send things to me and everything.            A&M was

57  




1      not one of them that ever talked back to me.          However, I did

2      wear an A&M shirt on the day of College Day because we were

3      trying to represent everyone, so there's probably pictures

4      of me on Facebook with A&M stuff on it.          It makes no

5      difference to me whatsoever.

6                   MR. WARD:     All right.    I want to make sure the

7      jurors understand.       Texas A&M is not a party.     Nobody's

8      seeking any money against Texas A&M, but there will be some

9      folks here that have some -- that work at the Texas

10     Transportation Institute that have a very -- we believe a

11     significant financial interest.

12                  Is -- now, is there -- how does the panel -- I

13     want to give you a statement that whether you agree or

14     disagree with what your life experiences have taught you.

15                  Is it your life experience that sometimes when

16     somebody has an individual interest -- large individual

17     financial stake, that they might sometimes place that above

18     the interest of society as a whole?          Anybody -- how do you

19     feel about that, I guess, Mr. Cook?

20                  JUROR COOK:     You are determined to let me talk,

21     ain't you?     I -- I don't know.       I mean, I guess it would be

22     possible if somebody had a lot of money at stake, they may

23     let that cloud their judgment concerning people as a whole.

24                  MR. WARD:     All right.    Does anybody agree with

25     Mr. Cook on that or not?        Anybody that agrees that that
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 58 of 135 PageID #: 15943

58  




1      might -- that personal financial interest might cloud their

2      judgment on what was best for society as a whole?             Did I say

3      that -- that's the way I was interpreted what you said; is

4      that right, Mr. Cook?

5                  JUROR COOK:     Yes, sir.

6                  JUROR SUE GREEN:        I guess I think most of us put

7      our self interest above society as a whole -- as a whole.

8                  MR. WARD:     Well, now she's -- stay with me here.

9                  JUROR SUE GREEN:        Okay.

10                 MR. WARD:     Stay with me.       We've got two -- you

11     know, I didn't understand Mr. Cook to say that most of us.

12     He said he thought sometimes.          You believe that most of us.

13     I guess what I'm asking -- how many on the panel are more in

14     the camp where what Ms. Green said as opposed to what

15     Mr. Cook said, maybe?       How many agree with Ms. Green on

16     this?   No. 1, No. 13, No. 17, 21, and 22.

17                 JUROR MARTIN:     22.

18                 MR. WARD:     Okay.     Thank you.    Well, the rest of

19     you, do you agree with Mr. Cook or you just don't have an

20     opinion, I guess, is what I'm asking?            Would anybody that

21     agrees with Mr. Cook, would you raise your hand?             Sometimes

22     it would.

23                 Okay.     Mr. Surman.

24                 Ms. -- Ms. Hudgins, and No. 16 -- sorry, I can't

25     keep up well.       Mr. Moore, right?       Anyone else?   Did I miss

1      it?     Okay.     Thank you very much.

2                      Now, the Federal Highway Administration -- the

3      Federal Highway Administration is one that you're going to

4      hear a lot about this agency.            Is there anyone on the panel

5      that's ever worked for the Federal Highway Administration?

6      You or a member of your family, anything like that?               Is

7      there anybody in here that has ever worked for the Texas

8      Highway Department dealing with maintenance or anything like

9      that?

10                     All right, sir.      And, Mr. Windham?

11                     JUROR WINDHAM:      Yes, sir.

12                     MR. WARD:   Okay.     And who did you -- who

13     worked --

14                     JUROR WINDHAM:      I worked one summer with the

15     Highway Department.         My dad retired from Texas Highway

16     Department.

17                     MR. WARD:   What did he do for the Texas Highway

18     Department?

19                     JUROR WINDHAM:      He was just general maintenance on

20     the roads.

21                     MR. WARD:   That be up in Atlanta, out of that

22     office?

23                     JUROR WINDHAM:      No, he was down in Center, Shelby

24     County.

25                     MR. WARD:   All right.     Thank you, sir.     I just --

1      you had that experience.

2                   Is there anyone that believes that the decision

3      makers -- I'm not talking about -- I'm talking about the

4      people that make decisions.       Anyone believes that a federal

5      agency, the decision makers never make a mistake?            Well,

6      I'll say it another way.      Does everyone believe that the

7      federal decision makers in one of these large -- like the

8      Federal Highway Department, is a large bureau --

9      bureaucratic agency, that they can make mistakes?            Anybody

10     -- everybody agree with that, the federal government, that

11     they can?

12                  All right.   Anyone here that thinks the folks who

13     make the decisions at the federal agencies, and I'm talking

14     about decisions about what happens, anyone believes that

15     they are not subject to outside or political influence?              No

16     one's raising hands.      Stated another way, does everyone

17     believe that the decision makers at the bureaucratic agency,

18     such as that, may be affected by outside or political

19     influence?     Do y'all agree with that?      Okay.

20                  Now, it gets to be important in this case.         Assume

21     with me for a moment that a -- someone makes the decision or

22     determines -- a decision maker -- I'm not talking about

23     those that they're doing all the work.         I'm talking about

24     those that are there making the decisions.            Assume with me

25     that something comes up and they realize, oh, a mistake has
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 61 of 135 PageID #: 15946

61  




1      been made and perhaps it's on my watch and it's been made

2      for as long as seven years before it's called to my

3      attention.     Assume that to be the case, how many would

4      believe that that person is likely to say, oh, we should

5      have caught that, we made a mistake, we're going to correct

6      it, as opposed to that's the one possibility -- or it might

7      be more likely to sort of dig in and try to justify their

8      mistake or even cover it up.       So you've got two

9      possibilities.     They're going to say, oh, that happened on

10     my watch.     I'm going to own up to it and try to do something

11     about it.     Or -- that'd be one possibility.       How many

12     believe that's the most likely possibility?

13                  All right.    That's Juror No. 4, Juror No. 17,

14     Juror No. 16, Juror No. 8.

15                  And then how many of you believe that the more

16     likely possibility is that they might be more likely to try

17     to sort of dig in and justify the mistake or even cover it

18     up?   How many feel that way?      Anybody in this group?

19     No. 13, No. 3, No. 2, No. 9, and No. 10, No. 18.          Can you

20     hold your cards up?       I'm sorry.   See, that's Mr. -- No. 23,

21     Mr. Oxsheer, No. 22, No. 21, No. 30, No. 24, and No. 29.

22     Did I get everyone's number?

23                  All right.    Now, in June of 2014, Judge -- excuse

24     me, the Federal Highway Administration wrote a letter saying

25     now that we reviewed all of the materials that were brought
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 62 of 135 PageID #: 15947

62  




1      to our -- I'm not going to quote it, but they wrote a letter

2      that said, oh, we've now reviewed all of the matters brought

3      to our attention by Mr. -- Mr. Harman, and we're going to

4      say that these terminal heads were actually approved and

5      subject to reimbursement from 2006 through time until today,

6      June -- just last month when they wrote this letter.

7                  We've been -- Judge -- His Honor has been kind

8      enough to tell us what he was going to instruct you, and I'm

9      not going to try to read it.       But he will tell you that that

10     letter from the Federal Highway Administration does not in

11     and of itself absolve any mistakes or absolve Trinity from

12     any liability under the False Claims Act.

13                 THE COURT:     Five minutes, counsel.

14                 MR. WARD:    What he says -- thank you, Your Honor.

15                 What he says effectively is that you got to look

16     at all of the evidence to determine whether or not Trinity

17     has violated the False Claims Act.        And that's just a short

18     rendition, but I believe that's -- I believe that's the crux

19     of what he's saying to you.

20                 Is there anybody that's going to have difficulty

21     following the Judge's instruction, and say, well, I just

22     have to believe that since they were in charge of approving

23     these products, if they look at it now and say, it's -- it

24     was all okay in spite of the fact that some things were not

25     disclosed, you know, how do we lean?        Is there anybody on
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 63 of 135 PageID #: 15948

63  




1      the panel that's not going to be able to follow the Judge's

2      instruction and look at all the evidence, including that

3      letter?     We want you to look at the letter.       I take it since

4      no one's raising your hand, I'll say it another way.           Does

5      everyone agree with me that they'll follow the Judge's

6      instruction and weigh all of the evidence before making a

7      decision?     Anybody that can't do that, I'll ask you?        No?

8                   Okay.   So all of those that can do that, please

9      raise your hand.

10                  Now, Judge Gilstrap has told you about the burden

11     of proof, about the greater weight and degree of credible

12     testimony.     You've got these scales, and you think about,

13     well, I've got 101 pieces of paper.        I put 50 here, and I

14     put 50 here, they're balanced.        But you put that other piece

15     of paper, and it tips ever so slightly in favor of we'll say

16     the Plaintiff in this case, is there anyone that disagrees

17     that the law -- in a case where we're seeking $208 million,

18     is there anyone that would have any difficulty in applying

19     that burden of proof when there's that amount of money?

20                  Another way.     Do you -- is there anyone that feels

21     like the burden of proof ought to be heavier than that?

22     Yes, sir?     No. 18, Mr. Sweeten?

23                  JUROR SWEETEN:     I would think it would have to be

24     a little bit heavier than -- than one sheet of paper.

25                  MR. WARD:   Well, it's --

1                  JUROR SWEETEN:     It's difficult to say.     I -- I

2      don't really know.

3                  MR. WARD:    You don't know, all right.

4                  JUROR SWEETEN:     I think it would have to be a

5      little bit heavier than a single piece of paper.

6                  MR. WARD:    Is it fair to say, Mr. Sweeten, then

7      you would not quite be able to follow his instruction on

8      that?

9                  THE COURT:    Two minutes, Counsel.

10                 JUROR SWEETEN:     Just a teeny tiny bit.     I -- I --

11     I don't -- I feel like I could follow his instructions, yes.

12     But one piece of paper, I'm -- you know, it's got to be --

13     I think it has to be a little more.

14                 MR. WARD:    All right.    Trinity Industries -- thank

15     you, sir, Mr. Sweeten.       I'm running out of time.

16                 Trinity Industries is a company in Dallas, and

17     they have a manufacturing plant over here in Harrison

18     County.    It doesn't have anything to do with these terminal

19     heads.    Is there anybody that does business with Trinity

20     Industries?    Your employer?

21                 Okay.   Would it make it difficult for you, sir, to

22     find against Trinity Industries in this case in light of

23     your employment.

24                 JUROR SURMAN:     Well, they're my largest supplier.

25     I buy all my concrete from them.

1                   MR. WARD:    Well, do you think that -- in

2      honestly --

3                   JUROR SURMAN:    It's Martin Marietta now, I

4      believe.     I believe they've been bought out, so...

5                   MR. WARD:    Well, do you think it would be

6      difficult for you to sit -- return an adverse verdict?

7                   JUROR SURMAN:    Not really.   You asked the question

8      if anybody had any dealing with them --

9                   MR. WARD:    Yes, okay.

10                  JUROR SURMAN:    -- well, I do.

11                  MR. WARD:    All right.   Thank you very much.     All

12     right.     I'm going to -- I've asked you a lot of questions,

13     and my time is running out.       I just have -- so at this point

14     I got to ask you one last general question, and that is in

15     your heart of hearts, as you sit here, what I've asked --

16     whether I've asked you that or not because I can't ask the

17     right question.     I learned that the first case I ever tried

18     in 1968.     Is there anything as you sit there now that you

19     know in your heart of hearts, I know that I can't be fair

20     and impartial to the Plaintiff, Mr. Josh Harman, in this

21     case?

22                  All right.    I take it by your silence that all of

23     you are promising me there's nothing that would prevent you

24     from being fair and impartial.

25                  Thank you very much.

1                   Thank you, Your Honor.

2                   THE COURT:     All right.     The Defendants may now

3      address the panel.

4                   MR. MANN:     Thank you, Your Honor, and may it

5      please the Court.

6                   Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.           My name is

7      Mark Mann, as I've been introduced.           I'm from Henderson,

8      Texas.

9                   THE COURT:     Mr. Mann, would you like a warning on

10     your time?

11                  MR. MANN:     Yes, sir.     If you can let me know when

12     I have five minutes left.

13                  THE COURT:     All right.     Proceed.

14                  MR. MANN:     Thank you.

15                  How many of you are old enough to remember Paul

16     Harvey?   How many remember what he used to say, and now the

17     rest of the story?        I want to give you the rest of the

18     story.

19                  Let's start off, first of all, with this product.

20     Put it up because it's not on my screen.              Thank you.   Just

21     leave it up.

22                  This is the product that we're talking about that

23     Texas A&M developed.        It has a patent on it since 1999.

24     Texas A&M designed it.        Their professors there did at the

25     Texas A&M Texas Transportation Institute.              They still hold a

1      patent today.    They allow Trinity to manufacture this

2      product, weld it, fabricate it, put it together.

3                  Trinity, in return, sells it to practically every

4      state in the United States.       Any change that has been made

5      to this product has been approved by Texas A&M.          It is their

6      product.    We only have the license and the right to produce

7      it.

8                  Crash tests were done on this product in 2005 and

9      2010.   In 2005, they did testing because the states want to

10     know if they're going to put this product in, are they going

11     to get federal funding, get reimbursed?         Like the state of

12     Texas, they'll put them in and they get reimbursement from

13     the federal government.      But the federal government, FHWA,

14     Federal Highway Administration, tells the states and tells

15     Texas A&M and tells Trinity that in order for it to be

16     federally reimbursed, it has to pass what's called an NCHRP

17     350 test.    Just remember 350 test.      And it passed that in

18     2005.   And they reported it to Trinity.        They put together a

19     test report.    They gave it to Trinity, and Trinity passed it

20     on to the FHWA, the Federal Highway Administration.

21                 The Federal Highway Administration, on September

22     the 2nd of 2005, said passes the test and so they started

23     putting them out on the roads.       You will drive by these on

24     your way to your home -- every single one of you will.

25                 Now, what happened was in 2012, there was
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 68 of 135 PageID #: 15953

68  




1      a -- this test that was done had what I would call a

2      mistake, like they would call a mistake.         What happened was

3      the -- the test report itself didn't say in the test report

4      that the piece right here had been changed from four inches

5      -- five inches to four inches.       Fact is it was tested.

6      There's video, pictures, and the Texas A&M professors that

7      tested this will be here in the courtroom to tell you the

8      four inch was tested.      That's what we sent up to Texas -- to

9      FHWA.

10                 Now, what Mr. Harman's trying to say is that this

11     wasn't just a mistake.      This was a fraudulent intentional,

12     meant to do it error.      And we deny it.     Texas A&M denies it.

13     The FHWA denies it.

14                 What Mr. Ward said was when you make a mistake,

15     you own up to it.     Texas A&M went up in 2012, talked to the

16     FHWA, said let us show you the pictures, videos, let me tell

17     you this is what we tested, this right here, and the FHWA

18     said, fine, as late as June of this year.

19                 Now, the fact is this case is not about a mistake.

20     The False Claims Act means -- and you will be instructed by

21     the Court -- did you fraudulently, intentionally mean to

22     misrepresent something to the government to get funding?

23                 And all that happened in this case, and I think it

24     will be clear in the end, is there was a mistake made.           And

25     to Texas A&M's credit, but embarrassment, they said, we made

1      a mistake in sending that piece -- those pieces of paper up

2      there because the four-inch was tested.         It was tested again

3      in 2010.

4                  Now, in this case, you will not hear from one

5      single Federal Highway Administration official tell you that

6      there was a fraud committed or that they want money back.

7      You will only hear from Mr. Harman and the people that they

8      have hired to pursue this lawsuit.

9                  THE COURT:     Let's move on to specific questions --

10                 MR. MANN:     Thank you.

11                 THE COURT:     -- Counsel.

12                 MR. MANN:     Now, what I want to ask you about is

13     first of all, do any of you know anything about this case?

14     Ever heard of it?       Know anything about it?

15                 How many of you have any special knowledge or

16     training in guardrails or -- or any -- any of those type of

17     products out on our roads?       Any of you?    Raise your hand if

18     you have any special training, help put them in, do

19     construction work involving guardrails, that type of thing,

20     or your husband or your wife or your kids, anybody?           Yes,

21     sir?

22                 JUROR CRAWFORD:     Yes, sir, it's not directly me

23     doing something with it.       I do work for a civil engineering

24     company and we do highways and roads and we do specify

25     those, you know, TXDOT stuff --

2                   JUROR CRAWFORD:       -- stuff like that.

3                   MR. MANN:     I'm sorry, at KSA?       Do you work for

4      KSA?

5                   JUROR CRAWFORD:       No, Hayes Engineering.

6                   MR. MANN:     Hayes Engineering.       Okay.     And so you

7      spec those for the roads?

8                   JUROR CRAWFORD:       Right.     As far as hands-on,

9      anything like that, we don't have anything to do with it.

10                  MR. MANN:     All right.       Thank you, sir.

11                  Anybody else?     Has anybody ever been involved in

12     an accident or wreck where you were unfortunate enough to

13     leave the road and run into guardrails or terminals,

14     anything like that where that became part of the accident,

15     anybody?     Your wife, your husband, your children involved in

16     any accidents where they actually left the road because

17     that's how you would hit it?           These are off on the sides of

18     the roads.     Okay.     Nobody?     I don't see any hands.       Thank

19     you.

20                  Do any of you know the -- the -- a few of the

21     lawyers that I want to talk about?             Mr. Ward, here that

22     talked to you this morning, anybody know Mr. Ward or his

23     wife or children, people that work with him, for him,

24     anybody on the panel?        Okay.     I don't see any hands.       Thank

25     you.

1                  Anybody who knows Mr. Maness or Mr. Truelove or

2      their wife or children or socialize with them?

3                  Yes, sir, Mr. Moore.

4                  JUROR MOORE:     Not directly, but I know Mr.

5      Truelove from baseball.

6                  MR. MANN:     Okay.

7                  JUROR MOORE:     When I was younger and played

8      baseball, I was an umpire.

9                  MR. MANN:     Okay.   All right.   So did he give you

10     any trouble?

11                 JUROR MOORE:     No, no trouble.

12                 MR. MANN:     Okay.   All right.   Anybody else know

13     any of those gentlemen?       Okay.   And I'm not -- I'm just

14     going to ask because stranger things have happened, but

15     Mr. Carpinello, Ms. Dyer, Mr. Shelly, Ms. Teresa Monroe,

16     George Coe, do any of you know any of those lawyers?

17                 They're not from this area.

18                 Oh, I'm sorry, did I -- did I keep going and --

19     did somebody else know -- yes, sir?

20                 JUROR GARY:     I know Mr. Maness and Mr. Truelove

21     both indirectly.     My wife's in the insurance business, and I

22     see them both quite a bit at events and --

23                 MR. MANN:     Okay.

24                 JUROR GARY:      -- things of that nature.

25                 MR. MANN:     Okay.   Thank you, Mr. Gary, appreciate

1      that.

2                  Did I miss somebody else?      Anybody else have their

3      hand up?    Okay.   Sorry that I missed that, Mr. Gary.

4                  Finish my question.     Do any of you know those

5      lawyers even though they're not from this area?          Anybody?

6      Nobody?    Okay.

7                  Now, I want to ask you a question.        Mr. Ward asked

8      you some questions about Texas A&M.        Let me -- let me tell

9      you why I'm going to ask this.       33 years ago when I married

10     into a family who has a bunch of Baylor Bears in it, I have

11     a father-in-law who bleeds green and gold and I remember

12     sitting in the living room and we were talking.          This is

13     back in the early '80s, and I said -- we were talking

14     football and he said you know what, Mark, we're supposed to

15     say, Mr. Mann, but Mark is what he called me.          He said, you

16     know, if there was a contest between Baylor --I mean, A&M

17     and Russia, I'd just have to vote for Russia.

18                 Now, I knew right then that that was an issue.

19     And so interestingly enough, my first son went to A&M, so I

20     had told him, you probably need to go down there and talk to

21     Papa who's the father-in-law and tell him you're going to

22     A&M, see if he's going to disinherit you.         Now, that's all

23     fun and -- and games and football and sports.          What I want

24     to ask you is in life, in this business with Texas A&M and

25     this being their product, does anybody have an issue with

1      Texas A&M where you just say, look, I have a feeling, even

2      though I don't know much about this case, that A&M and four

3      professors and the Texas A&M Transportation Institute would

4      fraudulently get together with Trinity and the Federal

5      Highway Administration and lie about this to the detriment

6      of the public?     Anybody just have that feeling?       I don't see

7      any hands.

8                   That's what this case is about.

9                   Now, do any of you know Mr. Harman, Josh Harman,

10     his brother Chris Harman, and they had two companies, Selco

11     and SPIG, okay?     I assume none of you do because they did

12     business up in the Virginia area and in that area.

13                  Let me tell you what I think some evidence is

14     going to be, and then I want to ask you a question about it

15     because Mr. Ward asked you some questions.         In this case, we

16     -- we believe that there will be evidence clearly, because

17     we had the testimony in the prior case, where Mr. Harman and

18     his brother hatched an idea and told a Court there that

19     their plan was they were going to try to put Trinity out of

20     business, use the money they got in that business -- in

21     that -- this lawsuit, and then go into competition and take

22     over market share and make hundreds of millions of dollars.

23     You will see the testimony -- the eight of you that are on

24     the jury, you will see that.

25                  Now, let me ask you this.     Do you believe that

74  




1      there is a reason to come to the courtroom and use the legal

2      system to do what you couldn't do in business?          In other

3      words, you couldn't make it in business so you use the

4      lawsuit to go back in, try to do what you couldn't do

5      without the lawsuit?       Does anybody have a feeling that

6      that's what our legal system can and should be used for,

7      anybody?    Yes, sir.

8                  JUROR FYFFE:     I'm sorry, I have to ask you to stay

9      in front of the mic a little better.        I could not fully hear

10     your question.

11                 MR. MANN:   I -- I'm sorry, and I apologize.

12                 JUROR FYFFE:     I do wear hearing aids, but I was

13     having trouble.     I'm sorry.

14                 MR. MANN:   What -- what did you miss, Mr. Fyffe?

15                 JUROR FYFFE:       Just that last statement -- the

16     last part of your --

17                 MR. MANN:   My question was:      Do you believe that

18     the legal system should be used to do what you couldn't do

19     in business?     In other words, unsuccessful business, but use

20     the legal system to find a way to get back into business.

21     That's what I'm asking.

22                 JUROR FYFFE:     You -- you asked do I believe you

23     should use that?

24                 MR. MANN:   Yes.

25                 JUROR FYFFE:     I'm not sure you should.     I don't

1      know that that would weigh my opinion, but I'm sorry, I had

2      to interrupt.

3                   MR. MANN:    No, no, that's fine.      I appreciate it.

4      And if -- if somebody doesn't hear, usually tells me I talk

5      too loud, but too slow.

6                   JUROR FYFFE:     Yeah, when you step away from the

7      mic, I couldn't quite hear everything you were saying.

8                   MR. MANN:    All right.   Thank you.     Thank you,

9      Mr. Fyffe.

10                  THE COURT:     I was just about to tell him that,

11     Mr. Fyffe, so we got that covered.

12                  MR. MANN:    I tend to wander around so I apologize

13     in advance.

14                  THE COURT:     Let's move along.

15                  MR. MANN:    Thank you.

16                  You were asked earlier if anybody's ever been

17     accused -- accused of making a mistake.          And I'm sure

18     everybody raised their hand.        Has anybody ever been

19     accused -- and I'm not going to ask -- I'm not going to

20     embarrass you or ask you what it was about because that's

21     not important -- accused of making an intentional fraudulent

22     statement where you know you didn't do it.           I want to know

23     if anybody's ever accused you of that.          More than really

24     just a mistake, a fraudulent statement?          Anybody ever been

25     accused of something like that, even though you didn't do

1      it?

2                  Okay.   Let's back up.      All of you that have been

3      accused of maybe making a mistake and, of course, obviously

4      we all make those, how did you handle that?          How did you

5      handle when you were accused of a mistake?         What did you do?

6      Somebody raise your hand and tell me what you did when you

7      were accused of a mistake.       Yes, ma'am.    Thank you for

8      volunteering.

9                  JUROR JONES:     Why not?

10                 MR. MANN:      Ms. Jones.

11                 JUROR JONES:     Why not?    If I was wrong, and I'm

12     sure I was at the time, I admitted to it and I made the

13     correction.

14                 MR. MANN:   Okay.    So you went to where the source

15     was --

16                 JUROR JONES:     Uh-huh.

17                 MR. MANN:   -- and you said, I made a mistake and

18     cleared it up or maybe you didn't?

19                 JUROR JONES:     Yeah, I mean --

20                 MR. MANN:   Okay.

21                 JUROR JONES:     -- you make a mistake, you should

22     own up to it.

23                 MR. MANN:   Thank you, Ms. Jones.

24                 Now, let me ask everybody -- would everybody else

25     would handle it that way?       Raise your hand if you would

77  




1      handle it that way, go -- yeah, go -- go to where the source

2      is, try to correct it.       All right.

3                   Now, for those of you who did not raise your hand,

4      let me ask you -- such as, Mr. Schreiber -- Schreiber.

5                   Mr. Schreiber, how -- how would you handle that?

6                   JUROR SCHREIBER:     I'd try and fix the mistake

7      myself.

8                   MR. MANN:    Okay.   Fix the mistake.    If you

9      couldn't fix it or if you didn't feel like it was a mistake,

10     what did you do?

11                  JUROR SCHREIBER:     Didn't feel it was a mistake,

12     I'd leave it alone.

13                  MR. MANN:    Okay.   All right.   Anybody else like

14     Mr. Schreiber?

15                  Thank you, Mr. Schreiber.

16                  Anybody else like Mr. Schreiber?

17                  All right.    Thank you.

18                  Now, I -- I know that some of you are going to

19     think this is a crazy question, so don't laugh too loud, but

20     I want to ask this and I ask it in a serious manner, too,

21     truly.     How many of you do not believe that we landed on the

22     moon?     Okay.

23                  Now, Mr. Johnson; is that correct?       Tell us why

24     you believe that we didn't land on the moon.          And when I say

25     we, I mean the United States of America?

1                  JUROR JOHNSON:     Well, to me, it's kind of like --

2      I mean, you see it on TV, but if you look at what they put

3      on TV now, they could just about do anything they want to

4      with a camera or whatever, so -- I mean, I haven't been up

5      there and I haven't seen -- they say there's stuff left up

6      there on the moon, but I haven't seen it other than what

7      they showed on a film.       It's just one of them things.

8      They made a good movie about it one time about where they

9      set it up in a hangar and made it look like they did.

10                 MR. MANN:   Right.    All right.     Thank you.   And I

11     appreciate you standing up.

12                 Now, I want to ask:     Does anyone else have that or

13     a similar feeling, saw it on a television; boy, they're

14     pretty good with cameras out here; it's the Government; it's

15     NASA; maybe didn't even do that?        Anybody have that feeling?

16     And if you do, that's obviously fine.          But I need to know

17     because I have a reason for asking it.

18                 Anybody else?

19                 Okay.   So can I have a hand?       Everybody else

20     believe, then, that we did land on the moon; is that

21     correct.

22                 Okay.   Thank you.    And I appreciate that,

23     Mr. Jones (sic), and I'm not doing that to embarrass you.               I

24     appreciate you bringing that up.

25                 JUROR JOHNSON:     That's okay.

1                  MR. MANN:     How many of you have -- and I know this

2      is going to get several hands -- has special knowledge or

3      training in welding, fabricating, drafting, those areas?

4      Anybody?

5                  Let's go through that real quick.

6                  Mr. Milford, I know you said earlier what you do,

7      but do you have -- have you ever welded on anything or done

8      metal work on something like these guardrails?

9                  JUROR MILFORD:        No.

10                 MR. MANN:     Well, you probably don't need the

11     speaker then because you've already --

12                 JUROR MILFORD:        No.   I haven't welded on no

13     guardrails, but I've welded on some stuff.

14                 MR. MANN:     Okay.     Well, let me ask you further.

15     Are you a welder?

16                 JUROR MILFORD:        No.

17                 MR. MANN:     Just do it at home?

18                 JUROR MILFORD:        Just for my own use.

19                 MR. MANN:     Okay.     Anybody else, like -- that

20     actually does it where you're getting paid for that work?

21     Mr. Cook?

22                 JUROR COOK:     Well, it's mostly farm equipment,

23     trailer-building stuff.       And as a hobby, I build and restore

24     old cars and stuff, so I do some metal work there.           But

25     nothing ever on guardrails or nothing like that.

1                  MR. MANN:     You know the difference between like a

2      butt weld and a fillet weld.

3                  JUROR COOK:     Basic welding, welding stuff up good

4      enough to do for my ownself and my job, but I couldn't go

5      into a job professionally.

6                  MR. MANN:     Okay.     All right.   Like me.

7                  Anybody else that kind of welds, welds on the

8      side?

9                  Yes, sir.     Mr. Windham?

10                 JUROR WINDHAM:        I worked at a welding shop in the

11     early '70s.

12                 MR. MANN:     Okay.     All right.   And that's it; is

13     that correct?       That's your background?

14                 JUROR WINDHAM:        Hobby stuff right now but, yeah.

15                 MR. MANN:     Yeah.     Okay.   Thank you, sir.

16     Anybody else?

17                 Okay.     Any of you do accident -- have been

18     involved in accident reconstruction, whether it be police,

19     FBI, insurance agencies?          Whoever may be doing accident

20     reconstruction work?       Anybody?

21                 Okay.     Now, I'm going to ask you some questions

22     that I know each one of you probably feels like you're at

23     the county fair or a gun show or something.           Everybody is

24     looking at you and the only thing that they're not doing is

25     touching you and feeling you, because everybody is just
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 81 of 135 PageID #: 15966

81  




1      looking at you.

2                  And the reason is, because when we go back in a

3      little bit to strike this jury list, both sides get to

4      strike off four people, and the eight that are left, that's

5      who the jurors are going to be.        Just where you know what

6      the process is.

7                  And this is our only chance to kind of find out a

8      few feelings that you may have and try to figure out how

9      does that play on either side in this case.          So let me ask

10     you this:

11                 A lot of people may have come into -- many of you

12     may have come into this courtroom today and say -- and you

13     filled out a questionnaire even on this.         Government's good,

14     or Government's bad, whatever that may be, or Government is

15     somewhere in between; it just depends on what it is.

16                 Did anybody show up here today and say, you know,

17     the Federal Highway Administration, that particular

18     organization, I don't believe they do good work, or I

19     wouldn't trust them or anything like that?         Anybody -- did

20     anybody know enough about them to even have that feeling?

21     Anybody?    Raise your hand.

22                 Let me take that one step further.        Any of you

23     believe that Government should not be involved in making

24     safety decisions for highway products?         Anybody?

25                 Yes, sir, Mr. Surman?

82  




1                  JUROR SURMAN:     I just believe it's too much red

2      tape involved in it.

3                  MR. MANN:     Okay.

4                  JUROR SURMAN:     Everybody's got a hand in it, in

5      what it looks like.       And it should be handled -- like if A&M

6      designed it and Trinity built it and they did the test, that

7      should be it.     I mean, why have somebody else involved

8      saying that it's safe?

9                  MR. MANN:     Okay.   All right.

10                 JUROR SURMAN:     I mean, it's just another party and

11     another party and --

12                 MR. MANN:     Okay.   I understand.    I understand what

13     you're saying.     Thank you, Mr. Surman.

14                 Anybody else have the same feelings of Mr. Surman?

15     You know, if A&M tested it and Trinity built it and it's

16     passed crash tests, it ought to be good enough between them?

17     Anybody believe that?

18                 Yes, sir, Mr. Miller?

19                 JUROR MILLER:     Yes, sir.   There -- I think there

20     are far too many agencies involved in decisions.          That's

21     pretty much it.

22                 MR. MANN:     Okay.   And Ms. Head?

23                 JUROR HEAD:     I agree.

24                 MR. MANN:     Same thing?

25                 JUROR HEAD:     I agree with him.     Same thing.

83  




1                   MR. MANN:   All right.    Anybody else agree with

2      them?

3                   Yes, ma'am, Ms. Green?

4                   JUROR SUE GREEN:    I think we're overregulated, but

5      I'm probably very conflicted about which things I definitely

6      want us to have regulated for our safety and the ones that I

7      think are extraneous.

8                   MR. MANN:   Okay.   All right.     That makes sense.

9      Anybody else have something you need to say on that?

10                  Let me just say -- do any of you believe that

11     the -- whatever business you may be in -- you may be a truck

12     driver, teacher, or whatever it may be, that the

13     Government's too involved in making decisions on -- in our

14     lives?     But do you believe that the FHWA should be involved

15     in decision-making whether something passes a test in order

16     to give your tax money to the states?

17                  You believe that the FHWA should be involved -- or

18     let's take -- do you believe the FHOA -- WA should not be

19     involved in making decisions whether your tax dollars go to

20     the states for these safety devices?          Anybody have that

21     feeling?

22                  So is it true that each one of you are telling me,

23     I believe the FHWA should be involved in making decisions

24     whether our tax dollars go to states?          Is that -- is that

25     true?    Anybody raise your hand and say, no, you

1      misunderstand me?       Anybody?

2                  Thank you.

3                  Does anybody here believe -- not knowing anything

4      else, that a Government witness should be given less

5      credibility than a non-Government witness?         Same issue, same

6      background, the only difference is one works for the

7      Government and one does not work for the Government.

8      Anybody have that feeling?

9                  If I have that choice, same issue, same knowledge,

10     same background, one worked for the Government, one does not

11     work for the Government would you -- would you say one is

12     more believable than the other, without knowing anything

13     else?   You just have that gut instinct.        You say:    I

14     wouldn't believe anybody from the Government that testified?

15     Anybody?

16                 Nobody?

17                 Okay.     Thank you.

18                 I want to know a little bit about your

19     personalities, if you could help me just a little bit.           How

20     many of you, if you're watching a movie or sporting event or

21     maybe it's your child or your friends, you're either the

22     type that when you watch something, you go I'm trying to

23     figure out what the answer is going to be before I get to

24     the end of this movie?       Or do you want to be -- listen to

25     everything and then make a decision in the end?

85  




1                   Aren't there some CSI shows that they kind of tell

2      you what the answer is at the beginning, and then they tell

3      you why they got to it?        Maybe you like those shows.       But

4      then there are others that say:           I want to read the book to

5      the end.     I want to see the movie to the end, and then I'll

6      make my decision on what I think.

7                   How many of you are going from the very beginning;

8      you're trying to make -- figure out the answer at the very

9      beginning?

10                  All right.   Let's -- let's kind of take it

11     row-by-row.     Ms. Leflett?

12                  JUROR LEFLETT:     Uh-huh.

13                  MR. MANN:    Yes, ma'am.       Right up here.    4, No. 4.

14     I'm sorry.

15                  JUROR LEFLETT:     I do that, but then I know I

16     should wait, wait until the end.           I just do that.

17                  MR. MANN:    You see what I'm getting at here?

18                  JUROR LEFLETT:     I know what you're getting at.

19                  MR. MANN:    We're going to have a trial and don't

20     make a decision until you hear all the evidence.

21                  JUROR LEFLETT:     I'm just talking about the movies,

22     the shows.

23                  MR. MANN:    I'm trying to give you a better analogy

24     that makes it more interesting.           Thank you, Ms. Leflett.

1      to figure out that answer right now before I hear

2      everything?

3                   Ms. Head?

4                   THE COURT:     And let's please stand up.

5                   JUROR HEAD:     Unfortunately, I'm bad about that

6      with anything.

7                   MR. MANN:     There's nothing wrong with it.

8                   JUROR HEAD:     That's just my personality.

9                   MR. MANN:     My wife tells me she's going to shoot

10     me if I give her the answer before she gets to watch

11     everything.     So I'm like you on that.

12                  Okay.   Yes, ma'am, Ms. Green?

13                  JUROR SUE GREEN:       I like a good mystery, so I'm

14     always trying to solve it.

15                  MR. MANN:     Okay.    All right.   Anybody else like

16     Ms. Green?

17                  Yes, ma'am.     Ms. -- Juror 21, Ms. Childers?

18                  JUROR CHILDERS:       Yes.   I do that when I read books

19     and everything, but I do go ahead and finish the book.

20                  MR. MANN:     Okay.    You don't flip to the back?

21                  JUROR CHILDERS:       No, no, no.   I just try to figure

22     it out.

23                  MR. MANN:     Okay.    Anybody else like Ms. Childers?

24                  JUROR MARTIN:     Same thing.

25                  MR. MANN:     Same answer.     You read it but you're

1      trying to figure it out through the book?

2                   JUROR EAVES:     Yes.

3                   MR. MANN:   All right.    Anybody else?    Ms.

4                   JUROR EAVES:     Same thing.

5                   MR. MANN:   All right.    Mr. Sweeten?    That's fine.

6      Ms. Coker?

7                   JUROR COKER:     With my counseling background, I

8      think that's the humanistic part of it, to try to analyze

9      it.

10                  MR. MANN:   Thank you, Ms. Coker.

11                  And, Mr. Sweeten, I bet you're going to tell us

12     the same thing.

13                  JUROR SWEETEN:     Same thing.

14                  MR. MANN:   All right.    Now, the rest of you, you

15     like to be entertained and you go through it and then you

16     make your decision in the end, correct?

17                  The reason I bring that up in this case, the

18     Defendant goes second.        The -- the Plaintiff always gets to

19     put their evidence on first because it's their burden of

20     proof.   They have the burden of proof in this case.          And so

21     for you to make a fair decision in this case, we need you to

22     not only listen to what our cross examination is of their

23     witnesses, but what our evidence is.

24                  And the evidence you'll hear from what will be

25     several professors from Texas A&M.          You'll hear from an
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 88 of 135 PageID #: 15973

88  




1      expert in the field of safety from -- products and safety in

2      the highway area.     You're going to hear witnesses from

3      Trinity.     And when you hear from all of those, what you're

4      going to be listening for, I propose, is whether you think

5      is this just a mistake, or is this something that was

6      intentional?     It was conspired and put together from the

7      beginning?

8                   And the fact is, we think what you're going to

9      find in the end is that this was just a misstep by Texas A&M

10     that got passed on for seven years because every FHWA that

11     drove down the road could see that right there.          Every

12     vendor that drove down the road could see that right there.

13     When you drive home today, you can see that right there

14     (indicating).

15                  This isn't some hidden -- hidden, fraudulent

16     issue.     It is just a mistake.    And what I want to ask you

17     about is, do you think it's right or fair that the gentlemen

18     from Texas A&M that invented this product and gets some

19     royalties from it for their invention -- actually Texas A&M

20     gets all the royalties.      They share some of it with these

21     professors.

22                  Do you think it's fair that Mr. Harman brings this

23     lawsuit, and if he's successful, he's going to receive more

24     money than the people who actually invented this thing and

25     that it's out on the road and approved for funding by the

1      FHWA in almost every single state in this country?

2                  Now, can I get a volunteer to speak up on that

3      where I don't have to just pick somebody out.

4                  Mr. Salazar, can I pick on you just a minute?

5                  JUROR SALAZAR:      Sure.

6                  MR. MANN:   What's your thoughts on that?

7                  JUROR SALAZAR:      I kind of understood your

8      question, but I -- I don't think it's right that

9      they -- somebody sits there and just looks at it and says,

10     hey, something's wrong with it, you know, and then try to,

11     you know, make some money off of it.

12                 MR. MANN:   Mr. Salazar, would you require the

13     Plaintiff to meet their burden of proof to show that there

14     was fraudulent, intentional misrepresentation to the

15     Government in this case?        Would you hold them to that

16     burden?

17                 JUROR SALAZAR:      Yeah.   I think they'd have to come

18     up with specific -- very specific things as to why -- why

19     they feel that way or prove, you know, what happened

20     actually did happen.

21                 MR. MANN:   Yeah.     While I have you up, because I'm

22     going to run out of time in just a minute, can I ask you a

23     little bit more?

24                 JUROR SALAZAR:      Sure.

25                 MR. MANN:   The Court is not going to instruct any

1      of you, I don't anticipate, that if you find a sheet of

2      paper on one side of those scales that that's enough.

3      There's not going to be an instruction like that.

4                  I anticipate the Court's going to instruct you

5      that they have to come up with a preponderance of the

6      evidence, more evidence than not.        It's not our burden of

7      proof in the case.      It's their burden.

8                  Can you hold them to that?

9                  JUROR SALAZAR:    Yes.   You have to look at it all

10     cumulatively, and then everybody has to agree.          I mean, we

11     have to discuss it and we have to agree with the final

12     verdict.

13                 MR. MANN:    You agree -- I mean, I'm assuming that

14     when you were in business at Southwestern Bell, when you

15     were making decisions about employees, you kind of weighed

16     the evidence and made decisions, right?

17                 JUROR SALAZAR:    I had to evaluate personnel and,

18     you know, grade them as to whether, you know, they were good

19     or bad.

20                 MR. MANN:    I appreciate you letting -- being the

21     guinea pig for me.      Thank you very much.

22                 Before today, when you came here today, did

23     anybody know what a terminal head was, or did -- had you

1      need to erase it.

2                  Trenton -- Mr. Sweeten?       I'm sorry.

3                  JUROR SWEETEN:       I've seen YouTube videos.      I don't

4      know if it's YouTube or not, but before they had those

5      things, the instance of -- without them, they go through the

6      windshield and whatnot.       I recall something like on TV or

7      something --

8                  MR. MANN:    Yeah.

9                  JUROR SWEETEN:       -- about it.

10                 MR. MANN:    And did -- was that part of those

11     videos where, like, before we had these guardrails, you just

12     run into these concrete barriers and things like that?              Was

13     that part of that?

14                 JUROR SWEETEN:       Well, it's more like these

15     barriers but without the yellow stripey thing there.

16                 MR. MANN:    Okay.

17                 JUROR SWEETEN:       Whatever you call that.

18                 MR. MANN:    Unprotected end.

19                 JUROR SWEETEN:       Yes.

20                 MR. MANN:    Okay.     All right.   Thank you for

21     bringing that up.

22                 Yes, sir, Mr. Moore -- or not Mr. Moore.          I'm

23     sorry.   Mr. Crawford.

24                 JUROR CRAWFORD:       Well, again, in civil

25     engineering, we do roadways and things like that.            And, yes,

1      we do spec those sometimes.          So I do have -- I have seen

2      them before.

3                  MR. MANN:     Okay.     So part -- a little bit -- part

4      of your business kind of related to the question I asked you

5      earlier.

6                  JUROR CRAWFORD:        Right.

7                  MR. MANN:      Thank you very much.

8                  For some of you who have not been involved in that

9      business like Mr. Crawford, have any of you -- besides just

10     knowing they were there, had you ever thought about why are

11     these heads here, before you came here today?            Probably

12     didn't.

13                 Okay.   Thank you.

14                 Oh, I'm sorry.        Yeah, Mr. Cook.    Is it Mr. Cook

15     that had your hand up?

16                 JUROR COOK:     I witnessed a wreck when I was

17     younger with the old-style barrier that curved down into the

18     ground where the vehicle rides up on it.            And then it rolled

19     several times by Lake O' the Pines dam before it went off.

20     And I notice when they started putting these up, it just

21     made me think they've changed it, you know, and, hopefully,

22     it's better.    Because I know that wreck was caused by the

23     riding it up and rolling.          It made the vehicle roll.

24                 MR. MANN:     Right.     Kind of like a launching pad

25     almost.

1                  JUROR COOK:     Yeah.

2                  MR. MANN:     Appreciate you bringing that up.

3                  Anybody else like Mr. Cook you saw that and you

4      wondered, well, why don't they put something on the ends of

5      those or do something about that curved end?           Anybody ever

6      have a thought about that?

7                  Yes, ma'am.     Ms. Leflett, you did?

8                  JUROR LEFLETT:        I just had a thought about it.

9                  MR. MANN:     Okay.     And that's it.   I appreciate you

10     raising your hand.

11                 Now, if you don't mind, because I've got just a

12     few minutes left, I've got some questions I'd like to ask

13     some specifically, if it's okay.

14                 Mr. Schreiber, if you don't mind, would you mind

15     taking the microphone and standing up for just a minute.

16     Can he have the microphone, Mr. McAteer?

17                 Mr. Schreiber, I'm not picking on you.         I'm just

18     going down the row.       Mr. Schreiber, did you earlier tell

19     me -- have you worked with or do you know Mr. Maness?

20                 JUROR SCHREIBER:        No.

21                 MR. MANN:     You don't know him?

22                 THE COURT:     Five-minute warning, Counsel.

23                 MR. MANN:     Thank you, Your Honor.

24                 Your wife, does she work with Mr. Maness in any

25     way that you know of?

1                  JUROR SCHREIBER:        Not to my knowledge.

2                  MR. MANN:     All right.     Thank you.     I appreciate

3      it.

4                  Mr. Clubb, I think, is on the back, so I'm not

5      going to come to you, Mr. Clubb, if you don't mind.

6      Mr. McAteer, I don't need Mr. Clubb.

7                  And the reason is, Mr. Clubb, you'll be glad to

8      know you're probably so far down we're probably not going to

9      reach you, so I'm not going to bother you right now.

10                 JUROR CLUBB:     Okay.

11                 MR. MANN:     But I do want to ask -- let's see,

12     Mr. Gary.    Is that Mr. Gary?        I've seen -- were you involved

13     in the Thiokol cases, the asbestos cases?             Did you have a

14     claim in those asbestos cases?

15                 JUROR GARY:     Where would that be?

16                 MR. MANN:     I think it was probably filed here in

17     Harrison County.

18                 JUROR GARY:     Maybe my mother.

19                 MR. MANN:     Could be.     I don't know.

20                 JUROR GARY:     Yeah.

21                 MR. MANN:     I looked some things up.

22                 JUROR GARY:     Yeah, yeah.

23                 MR. MANN:     I thought maybe that would be you.

24                 JUROR GARY:     Right.

25                 MR. MANN:     You don't know anything about that?

1                   JUROR GARY:     The Thiokol deal?

2                   MR. MANN:     Yeah, the asbestos cases.

3                   JUROR GARY:     I don't know if it was asbestos or

4      chemicals.

5                   MR. MANN:     Could be either one.

6                   JUROR GARY:     Yeah.

7                   MR. MANN:     Okay.

8                   JUROR GARY:     I don't remember just what my

9      involvement was in that.           I think I -- I think they came to

10     my whole family on that deal.

11                  MR. MANN:     All right.     Thank you very much for

12     standing up.

13                  Ms. Head -- Ms. Head, I thought I saw somewhere

14     where you had gone to college.           What did you study at

15     college?

16                  JUROR HEAD:     Medical terminology --

17                  THE COURT:     Ma'am, you're going to need to wait

18     until you get the mic and then stand up, please.             Thank you.

20     transcription.

21                  MR. MANN:     Okay.     All right.    Thank you, ma'am.

23                  Mr. Martin, you're retired.          Can you tell me what

24     your hobbies are?

25                  JUROR MARTIN:     I play golf.

1                  MR. MANN:     Good -- good hobby.

2                  Ms. Morris?     Ms. Morris, I don't think actually

3      made it up on this front part.

4                  Okay.   Those are a few questions I had because

5      there were some blanks in the questionnaires.

6                  Ladies and gentlemen, the last thing I want to ask

7      you is this, and it's similar to what Mr. Ward asked.           But

8      the fact is, I think both of us with enough experience and

9      have been to enough jury selections where obviously we can't

10     ask all the right questions, so I want to know -- and the

11     reason this comes up is because sometimes we -- we don't

12     know what all questions to ask.        The story has always been

13     in the past you need to ask people, because somebody may be

14     kin to someone; someone may know somebody.         If you don't ask

15     them, they don't have the chance to tell you.

16                 So what I want to know is, is there any reason

17     that you know of here today, after you heard what Mr. Ward's

18     had to say and what I've had to say, and assuming that those

19     things are going to be evidence before you in this case

20     where you believe that you cannot be fair and impartial in

21     this case, make a decision based on the evidence in this

22     case, and that maybe there are other cases that you'd be

23     better on, but this is one where you probably shouldn't be

24     on it because you've already made your decision now?

25                 Anybody?

1                  Ms. Head?     You sneaked your hand up just a little

2      bit.   Can you tell me about it?         And you'll need to stand

3      up.

4                  THE COURT:     You need to take her the microphone.

5                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        Who was talking?

6                  MR. MANN:     No. 12.     I'm sorry, Mr. McAteer.

7      Ms. Head.     She didn't raise her hand very high so you

8      couldn't see it.

9                  JUROR HEAD:     It's coming back down to the large

10     amount of money you're dealing with and kind of how I feel

11     about that.

12                 MR. MANN:     Okay.     All right.   And -- and honestly,

13     there's no wrong answer on this question.           Anybody --

14     anybody else after you've heard -- and it doesn't have to be

15     what Ms. Head said.       There may be some reason why, you know,

16     you -- you just say, I just can't be fair in this case and

17     make a decision; I can't be impartial, because that's what

18     we need.

19                 I'm going to fill you in on a secret.         They kind

20     of want somebody that looks at it their way, and we want

21     somebody that looks at it our way, but I'm trying to ask

22     you:   Is there some reason that you don't feel like you can

23     be fair and impartial?       Anybody?

24                 Okay.   I appreciate your time and attention.             We

25     look forward to putting on the evidence before you.              We

1      promise to move the case as quick as possible, but you can

2      understand with this amount of money and these accusations

3      involved that it's going to be a hard fight.           And we plan on

4      defending our position as best we can before each and every

5      one of the eight of you who are selected.

6                   Thank you.

7                   THE COURT:    All right.   Counsel, approach the

8      bench, please.

9                   (Bench conference.)

10                  THE COURT:    Does Plaintiff have members of the

11     panel they wish to challenge for cause?

12                  MR. WARD:    Yes.   No. 14, Your Honor.     He's said

13     Trinity is his largest customer.        I know he says he can be

14     fair, but I just -- I think that kind of financial interest

15     is just --

16                  THE COURT:    We'll talk about the reasons later.          I

17     just want to identify --

18                  MR. WARD:    And I want to talk to No. 7, too -- not

19     No. 7.   No. 12.

20                  THE COURT:    You're challenging her for cause?

21                  MR. WARD:    Yes, based on what she just said.

22                  THE COURT:    That's 12 and 14 from the Plaintiff.

23     Any more?

24                  MR. CARPINELLO:     I feel like 26.

1                   THE COURT:     Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to

2      have to ask you to be quiet while I'm talking to the lawyers

3      at the bench, please.

4                   (Bench conference.)

5                   THE COURT:     All right.   I have 12 and 14 from the

6      Plaintiffs.     Any other challenges for cause?

7                   MR. WARD:     I think we talked to No. 26, if we get

8      there.   I don't think we're going to get there, Judge.

9                   MR. MANN:     We don't have any.

10                  MR. WARD:     I don't know how many people --

11                  THE COURT:     Speak now or forever hold your peace.

12                  MR. WARD:     Challenge him.

13                  THE COURT:     That's 12, 14, and 26 from the

14     Plaintiff.

15                  All right.     I assume that's all right.    Any other

16     challenge from the Defendants?

17                  MR. MANN:     None from the Defendants, Your Honor.

18                  THE COURT:     Okay.   Then I'll keep these three and

19     those that have challenging problems and release everybody

20     else for a break.        And then we'll bring them up one at a

21     time.

22                  Okay.   You can return to your places.

23                  MR. MANN:     Thank you.

1      about to excuse you, except for the following members of the

2      panel, which I'm going to ask these folks to stay in their

3      seats, please.

4                   You may need -- especially if you're in the jury

5      box, you may need to stand up and let those around you out,

6      but if you would stay in your seats.

7                   Panel Members Nos. 1, 5, 12, 14, 21, 26, and 28.

8      Everybody except those, I'm going to excuse you to take a

9      brief recess.     I'm going to ask those that I excuse to stay

10     in the building.     As you exit the courtroom to your left,

11     our restrooms and water fountains.         You're free to visit

12     those.     You're free to discuss the -- the weather today, the

13     sports events.     If you like the World Cup in soccer, you can

14     talk about that.     You can talk about what happened over the

15     weekend.

16                  But I'm instructing you not to discuss anything

17     about what happened in the courtroom before you were excused

18     and take that recess this morning.         And that's simply

19     because you have heard absolutely no evidence in this case.

20                  This case is going to be decided solely on the

21     evidence that you hear from the witness stand under oath and

22     from documents that the Court specifically admits into

23     evidence.     That's the sole evidence in this case that the

24     jury that is selected must base their decision on with no

25     other -- no other influences.

1                   So don't discuss anything about what's happened in

2      the courtroom this morning.        Stay in the building; get a

3      drink of water; stretch your legs.         But everybody, except

4      Panel Members 1, 5, 12, 14, 21, 26, and 28, is excused at

5      this time.     If you'll exit the courtroom, please.

6                   (Jury panel out.)

7                   THE COURT:   All right.    Be seated, please.

8                   Counsel, if you'd approach the bench.

9                   And, Ms. Chandler, if you would come up and let me

10     visit with you here at the bench, please.

11                  (At the bench.)

12                  THE COURT:   Ms. Chandler, you indicated early on

13     that you had a potential scheduling problem with this week

14     and the first day or two of next week.         Tell me about that.

15                  JUROR CHANDLER:     It's specifically Thursday.      I am

16     a full-time med student at this college in Longview.            I'm on

17     my last semester, and I have a pharmacology midterm

18     Thursday, as well as an interview for an internship with

19     Allied Health Company.      It's very important.      If you would

20     have said that, it wouldn't have lasted so long.

21                  THE COURT:   That's Thursday of this week?

22                  JUROR CHANDLER:     Uh-huh, yes, sir.    And I can give

23     you some numbers to verify that if you need to.

24                  THE COURT:   I certainly trust you to tell me

25     accurately.

1                  Counsel, do any of you have questions for Ms.

2      Chandler?

3                  MR. MANN:    No, Your Honor.

4                  THE COURT:    I do not see she was challenged for

5      cause.

6                  Ms. Chandler, let me look at this situation.          If

7      I've got enough people to have a full jury without you, I

8      will let you go.     But I'm not going to know until I get

9      through everybody else.

10                 JUROR CHANDLER:     Okay.   I understand.

11                 THE COURT:    I'll certainly do what I can.

12                 JUROR CHANDLER:     Okay.

13                 THE COURT:    I'm going to -- I'm going to allow you

14     to join the rest of the panel out in the hallway.

15                 JUROR CHANDLER:     Yes, sir.

16                 THE COURT:     Just don't discuss anything about

17     what's been said in the courtroom.

18                 JUROR CHANDLER:     Okay.

19                 THE COURT:    Thank you.

20                 JUROR CHANDLER:     Thank you.

21                 THE COURT:    Mr. Thomas, can you come up, please,

22     sir?

23                 Come around here, Mr. Thomas.

24                 Mr. Thomas, early on you indicated that you might

1      and the first day or two of next week.          Tell me the

2      specifics of that.

3                  JUROR THOMAS:     Okay.     My mother had an accident

4      mowing the yard, so I've been taking care of her, you know,

5      doing things for her.

6                  THE COURT:    Okay.      Now, what -- what -- can you

7      tell me what kind of an accident?          I mean, she didn't cut a

8      toe off or anything like that, did she?

9                  JUROR THOMAS:     No, she just -- when she was

10     pushing her mower, she hurt herself, so she can't walk

11     around cooking and cleaning.

12                 THE COURT:      How old is your mother?

13                 JUROR THOMAS:     She's about 60 something.

14                 THE COURT:    Does she live by herself?

15                 JUROR THOMAS:     Yes.

16                 THE COURT:    Okay.      And you've been seeing about

17     her?

18                 JUROR THOMAS:     Yeah.     We live down the road from

19     each other.

20                 THE COURT:    Okay.      Are there any other reasons

21     that would interfere with you being able to serve if you

22     were selected on this jury?

23                 JUROR THOMAS:     Yes.

24                 THE COURT:    What else?

25                 JUROR THOMAS:     My back, and I got a headache, too.

1                  THE COURT:    Okay.     When you say you got a

2      headache, is that today or do you have headaches every day?

3                  JUROR THOMAS:     When I sit down for a long time, it

4      hurts my back.

5                  THE COURT:    And that causes your head to hurt?

6                  JUROR THOMAS:     (Witness nods head affirmatively.)

7                  THE COURT:    All right.     How long can you sit

8      without having a back problem that might lead to a headache

9      because we're going to take regular breaks through this

10     trial.    I doubt you're going to be sitting for more than an

11     hour, hour and a half without having a chance to stand up

12     and move around.     Can you do that without having a problem?

13                 JUROR THOMAS:     I'm not sure.    I just -- my mother,

14     for sure, needs me.

15                 THE COURT:    I'm -- I'm aware of your mother.           I'm

16     trying to cover all your bases here.

17                 JUROR THOMAS:     Okay.    I guess less than an hour, I

18     start to feel -- my back hurts.         It hurts right now.     It

19     hurts a lot.

20                 THE COURT:    All right.     Are you on medication?

21                 JUROR THOMAS:     No.

22                 THE COURT:    Okay.     Are there -- are there any

23     other reasons besides your mother and your back situation

24     that would keep you from being able to be here and serve if

25     you were selected?

1                  JUROR THOMAS:     I think that should do it.      It's

2      the attention span from the headache and the back and that

3      kind of messes the whole thing up for me.

4                  THE COURT:    Okay.   Is she -- is your mother under

5      the care of a doctor for her accident?

6                  JUROR THOMAS:     Yes, she has a doctor, that's for

7      sure.

8                  THE COURT:    And she's been to the doctor because

9      of this accident mowing?

10                 JUROR THOMAS:     Yes, sir.

11                 THE COURT:    Okay.   Is she on medication because of

12     that accident?

13                 JUROR THOMAS:     Yes, sir.

14                 THE COURT:    Okay.   All right.    Mr. Thomas, let me

15     -- let me talk to everybody else on the panel.           If there's

16     any way I can excuse you and still have enough people, I'll

17     be glad to do that, but I won't know until I get through

18     everybody else.     So I'm going to -- I'm going to let you go

19     out into the hallway with the rest of the group, get a drink

20     of water, stretch your legs, but just don't discuss anything

21     about what's been said in here.        You understand?

22                 JUROR THOMAS:     Thank you, thank you.

23                 THE COURT:    Okay.   You can join the rest of the

24     panel outside.

25                 Ms. Head, would you come up, please?

1                   Two things, Ms. Head.     No. 1, you indicated early

2      on that you might have a scheduling problem if you were

3      selected this week and maybe Monday or Tuesday of next week.

4                   JUROR HEAD:    Well, it --

5                   THE COURT:    What is that?

6                   JUROR HEAD:    -- actually it's because -- it's

7      no -- it's a fault of my own that I didn't read the

8      paperwork.     My elderly mother lives with me.       She's 72.    She

9      has arthritis, and when I'm -- like a personal call for her,

10     she has a call button for the emergency.

11                  THE COURT:    You don't live with her, but you live

12     in the area?

13                  JUROR HEAD:    No.   She lives in the same house with

14     me.

15                  THE COURT:    Oh, in the same house, okay.

16                  JUROR HEAD:    I'm kind of like her caregiver.       I do

17     things for her that she can't do for herself.

18                  THE COURT:    Do you have somebody that fills in

19     when you're not able to be there?

20                  JUROR HEAD:    No.

21                  THE COURT:    You don't have a --

22                  JUROR HEAD:    I have a brother -- no, but he

23     doesn't do anything.

24                  THE COURT:    And you don't have any other backup to

25     see about her?

1                   JUROR HEAD:    Well, not really.     My children --

2      she's --     works at the nursing home.      My daughter works here

3      in Marshall, so I'm just -- and my husband can't hear his

4      phone ring.     So -- but like if she has to push her emergency

5      button, I'm just the one that's on there for them to call me

6      to --

7                   THE COURT:    Now, if she pushes her button and they

8      call you and for some reason you don't answer, do they have

9      an alternative they call?

10                  JUROR HEAD:    They will send the ambulance.

11                  THE COURT:    Okay.   They don't call a second

12     person?

13                  JUROR HEAD:    I don't think she has another person

14     on her list.

15                  THE COURT:    Okay.

16                  JUROR HEAD:    She redid that here not too long ago.

17                  THE COURT:    Okay.   You also indicated when the

18     questions were being asked about whether there was anything

19     at all that could keep you from being completely fair and

20     impartial.     And I think I wrote down it comes down to a

21     large amount of money.       If you're selected on the jury and

22     if for some way your schedule can be dealt with so that you

23     can serve, could you be completely fair, 100 percent?

24                  JUROR HEAD:    I can't promise.    I can't promise you

25     that.

1                   THE COURT:     Okay.     What is your concern?    Are you

2      -- are you concerned that you'll favor the Defendants or the

3      Plaintiff?

4                   JUROR HEAD:     It's the condition of that his

5      company is bankrupt, and he's -- may get this large sum of

6      money, and that's what I have --

7                   THE COURT:     That causes a problem with the

8      Plaintiff in your mind?

9                   JUROR HEAD:     Uh-huh.     It does.   It does.

10                  THE COURT:     Okay.     Mr. Ward, Mr. Carpinello, do

11     you have any questions for Ms. Head?

12                  MR. WARD:     Well, is that something -- you're just

13     telling me that you don't really think you could be fair?

14                  JUROR HEAD:     Yeah, I just really don't think I

15     could.

16                  MR. WARD:     Be fair to the Plaintiff in this case?

17                  JUROR HEAD:     Exactly, exactly.      I mean, I can't

18     promise you.

19                  MR. WARD:     Well, no --

20                  JUROR HEAD:     I might could, but I can't promise

21     you.

22                  MR. WARD:     Well, you've got a serious question

23     about whether you can.

24                  JUROR HEAD:     Yeah.

25                  MR. WARD:     Okay.     I don't want a misstatement

1      there.     It's just the way I'm --

2                   JUROR HEAD:     And I -- you know, I hate to accuse

3      people of things, but I just have to be completely honest

4      with you and say -- I mean, I told you I have an issue with

5      the -- things like that.

6                   MR. WARD:     That's what we want you to do.

7                   JUROR HEAD:     With the two going hand in hand,

8      that's just a conflict.

9                   THE COURT:     Mr. Mann, do you have any questions

10     for Ms. Head?

11                  MR. MANN:     Only question, Ms. Head, is if the

12     Court instructs you on what the law is and what you're to

13     consider and not consider, could you follow the Court's

14     instructions?

15                  JUROR HEAD:     I can't make any promises.     I mean, I

16     just can't make any promises.

17                  THE COURT:     Okay.    All right.   Well, I think we've

18     covered everything, Ms. Head.          I'm going to -- I'm going to

19     allow you to join the rest of the panel outside in the

20     hallway.

21                  JUROR HEAD:     Uh-huh.    Okay.

22                  THE COURT:     Don't discuss anything about what's

23     been said in the courtroom.

24                  JUROR HEAD:     Okay.

25                  THE COURT:     Okay.    Thank you, ma'am.

1                  JUROR HEAD:     Thank you.

2                  THE COURT:     I'm going to excuse Ms. Head for

3      cause.

4                  Mr. Surman, would you come up, please, sir?

5                  JUROR SURMAN:     Yes, sir.

6                  THE COURT:     Two things, MR. Surman.     You indicated

7      early on that you might have a scheduling problem being able

8      to be here all week and the first day or two of next week.

9      Tell me about that.

10                 JUROR SURMAN:     It's just business, being away from

11     the cell phone, Internet service.         I run 26 employees,

12     scheduling workman.       When I go on vacation, I'm still

13     scheduling stuff.

14                 THE COURT:     You're self-employed?

15                 JUROR SURMAN:     Yes, sir.

16                 THE COURT:     Your company -- if you're not running

17     it, nobody's running it?

18                 JUROR SURMAN:     That's right.

19                 THE COURT:      Do you have an assistant?

20                 JUROR SURMAN:     I have field -- field crew, but

21     nobody that orders materials and schedules and bids jobs.            I

22     got three bids going out this week that I got to get --

23                 THE COURT:     What happens -- if something happens

24     to you medically and you're in the hospital, who runs the

25     company if you absolutely can't be there and your cell phone

1      doesn't work, who runs the company?

2                  JUROR SURMAN:     The contractors I work for fill in

3      and get the job done, but --

4                  THE COURT:      I mean, within your company, is there

5      somebody that can step in?

6                  JUROR SURMAN:     No, sir.   No, sir.

7                  THE COURT:    Not anybody at all?

8                  JUROR SURMAN:     Not -- not estimating -- I haven't

9      let anybody estimate anything but me in 16 years.

10                 THE COURT:    Okay.

11                 JUROR SURMAN:     I really -- I usually opt out on

12     jury duty by sending in, saying I own a business with 26

13     employees, but I've never --

14                 THE COURT:    Keep your voice down.

15                 JUROR SURMAN:     I've never been to this type of

16     deal and I thought I'd see what it was about.          I didn't

17     think it would be for a solid week.

18                 THE COURT:    Okay.   You also indicated during some

19     of the answers to the questions, when asked, that the

20     Plaintiff might start off somewhat behind based on your

21     views of things.     Can you tell me some specifics about that?

22                 JUROR SURMAN:     Well, it -- it's always somebody

23     looking out to get the big guy down, and that's kind of the

24     way I feel about it.      Like they found something that's red

25     tape that has really nothing to do with the product because

                                                                                112




1      the product does pass.      So to me, I start them off on the

2      down side because of that.        It's not really where something

3      failed, and it's -- and it's failed.          I mean, to me, they

4      got paperwork backing up the product.

5                  THE COURT:    Now, you heard me tell the group as a

6      whole --

7                  JUROR SURMAN:     I understand.

8                  THE COURT:    -- you've heard no evidence and you

9      got to base your decision solely on the evidence.           Could you

10     put that out of your mind, even if that's your feeling, but

11     could you put that out of your mind, wait until you hear all

12     of the evidence, and then make your decision solely on the

13     evidence if that's what it came down to?

14                 JUROR SURMAN:     Yes, sir.    I mean, it's like

15     watching a movie.      I'm going to be trying to guess -- I

16     mean, that's just the way I am, so -- I mean, that's --

17     you're asking if I done decided it one way.          That's the only

18     reason.    I'd still wait until the end to see how it turned

19     out.

20                 THE COURT:    Okay.    But if -- if I told you that

21     you could only consider the sworn testimony of the witnesses

22     and the documentary evidence that I admit into evidence and

23     that you had to make your decision solely on that, could you

24     do that?    That's my question.

25                 JUROR SURMAN:     Yes, sir.

1                  THE COURT:    Okay.     Okay.   Mr. Ward, do you have

2      any questions of this --

3                  MR. WARD:    You also indicated that your largest

4      customer -- and you're the sole owner of your business --

5      your largest customer is Trinity Industries.            Did I

6      understand --

7                  THE COURT:    I thought he said supplier.

8                  JUROR SURMAN:     Supplier, buy all my concrete

9      material from them.      I'm a concrete contractor.          Trinity

10     Industries sold out to Martin Marietta.            They're no longer

11     part of the concrete side of the aspect.            From what I

12     understand, there's a new owner in the concrete field.

13     Trinity does several things --

14                 MR. WARD:    I misunderstood your answer.           Okay.

15     You're saying that you bought from them?

16                 THE COURT:    Yes, sir.

17                 MR. WARD:    Okay.

18                 JUROR SURMAN:     I'm a customer of theirs.

19                 MR. WARD:    You're -- okay.        I just misunderstood

20     you.

21                 THE COURT:    They're not a customer of yours.              They

22     don't hire you?

23                 JUROR SURMAN:     No.    No, sir.     No, sir.    And the

24     material I do buy no longer is part of their field anymore.

25                 THE COURT:    Okay.

1                  MR. WARD:     I had one other question.      What you'd

2      asked him -- if it's all right, Your Honor?

3                  THE COURT:     Go ahead.

4                  MR. WARD:     Do you think this concern about your

5      being here for seven days this week and the rest -- and two

6      days next week, that your concern about what's going on with

7      your business would in any way affect your ability to

8      concentrate on the evidence and concentrate on the issues

9      involved?

10                 MR. SURMAN:     What time are we talking about

11     getting out of here in the evenings?

12                 MR. WARD:     5:30.

13                 JUROR SURMAN:     See, I still got to go do

14     estimating and go run by all the jobs, check material, see

15     if it's there and then call and schedule the next morning

16     before we start.

17                 THE COURT:      I understand, but the question is

18     notwithstanding all those things, if you were selected,

19     would those other worries preoccupy you such that you

20     couldn't concentrate on the testimony that was given?

21     That's the question.       Could you listen to the testimony or

22     would you be totally preoccupied with your business?

23                 JUROR SURMAN:     It's going to be in the back of my

24     mind.

25                 THE COURT:     I understand, but is it going to keep

1      you from hearing anything?

2                  JUROR SURMAN:      No.

3                  THE COURT:    Okay.      All right.     Mr. Mann, do you

4      have anything -- do you have anything else, Mr. Ward?

5                  MR. WARD:    No.

6                  THE COURT:    Do you have any questions, Mr. Mann?

7                  MR. MANN:    I don't have any, Your Honor.

8                  THE COURT:    Okay.      Mr. Surman, if I can get a full

9      jury panel -- get a full jury in the box without having to

10     have you here, I'm going to let you go.

11                 JUROR SURMAN:      Okay.

12                 THE COURT:    But I'm not going to know until I talk

13     to everybody else.

14                 JUROR SURMAN:      I understand.

15                 THE COURT:    So if you will, wait outside the

16     courtroom with the rest of the panel.             Just don't discuss

17     anything that's been said in here.

18                 JUROR SURMAN:      Okay.

19                 THE COURT:    Thank you, sir.

20                 JUROR SURMAN:      Uh-huh.

21                 MR. WARD:     Your Honor, could I call your

22     attention to something?

23                 THE COURT:    What's that?

24                 MR. WARD:    If you excuse -- if you excuse all four

25     of those, we would just get to No. 20 in our strikes.

1      That's all I was doing.       Whatever you want to do, I'm not

2      trying to interrupt.

3                  THE COURT:     No, I just want to hear all the

4      excuses.

5                  MR. WARD:    Okay.

6                  THE COURT:    That's why I tell them that.

7                  MR. WARD:    I'm not trying to rush anything.

8                  THE COURT:    Okay.     All right.   That was 14.      21 is

9      next by my count.

10                 Ms. Childers, would you come up, please?

11                 JUROR CHILDERS:       Hi.

12                 THE COURT:    Hi, Ms. Childers.      Early on this

13     morning you indicated that you might have a scheduling

14     problem for this week --

15                 JUROR CHILDERS:       Yes.

16                 THE COURT:    -- if you were selected.       Tell me

17     about the specifics of that, please.

18                 JUROR CHILDERS:       I have an 8-year-old and an

19     11-year-old and I'm a school guidance counselor and I don't

20     work in the summer, and so I'm the primary caregiver for my

21     two children.

22                 THE COURT:    Okay.

23                 JUROR CHILDERS:       And my husband works for the

24     railroad.    And I don't know if you're aware of anything to

25     do with that.     He has no schedule so that I can rely on him
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 117 of 135 PageID #: 16002

                                                                                117




1      to pick up the slack.

2                  THE COURT:    When I practiced law, I used to

3      represent the railroad.       I understand how their employees

4      are.

5                  JUROR CHILDERS:        Right.   So he doesn't have any

6      type of regular schedule, and I don't have any other

7      reliable child care.

8                  THE COURT:    No other family or anybody else?

9                  JUROR CHILDERS:     Well, I -- I have parents, and --

10     but they're -- my father is disabled and so my mom is kind

11     of not able to help me out in that respect, not for that

12     extended amount of time through the rest of this week, every

13     day, and Monday and Tuesday of next week.          And so it

14     would -- like this morning, I dropped both my kids off with

15     different friends on the way here.          So -- at 6:00 o'clock in

16     the morning.

17                 THE COURT:    Right.     I understand it's a hardship.

18     I'm just trying to figure out exactly what your

19     circumstances are.

20                 JUROR CHILDERS:     Right.

21                 THE COURT:    During -- during the summers when

22     school's not in session and your husband is at work,

23     what -- do you just call on friends when you have a conflict

24     comes up or you need to go to the doctor or see something?

25                 JUROR CHILDERS:     I take them with me.

1                  THE COURT:     If you can't take them, what do you

2      do?    What you did this morning?

3                  JUROR CHILDERS:        I call on a friend that -- you

4      know, obviously you can't do that for every day of the week.

5                  THE COURT:     Right.

6                  JUROR CHILDERS:        And, you know, friends have kids,

7      too.    So I just simply try not to do that.         I schedule many

8      of my doctor's appointments during the school years when I

9      can take my kids to school and then just go to the doctor

10     during the school day while I'm at work.

11                 THE COURT:     Is -- is that the sole reason, the

12     children's supervision?       Is there anything else about your

13     schedule that would be a problem for you?

14                 JUROR CHILDERS:        No.   It's just -- it's just the

15     kids' supervision.       I just don't have anybody but me.

16                 THE COURT:     Okay.

17                 JUROR CHILDERS:        And then if my hus -- I mean, he

18     may come home at 2:00 in the morning and then get called

19     back out for 11:00.

20                 THE COURT:     I understand how railroad employees

21     are scheduled.

22                 JUROR CHILDERS:        Right.

23                 THE COURT:     I'm discounting him.

24                 JUROR CHILDERS:        Right.   He's out of the picture.

25     I never know about him.

1                  THE COURT:     All right.     Well, let me see -- let me

2      talk to the rest of the group.

3                  JUROR CHILDERS:      Okay.

4                  THE COURT:     If I can excuse you and still have a

5      full jury, I certainly will.

6                  JUROR CHILDERS:      Okay.

7                  THE COURT:     Just don't discuss anything.

8                  JUROR CHILDERS:      I won't.

9                  THE COURT:     Join the rest of the group outside.

10                 JUROR CHILDERS:      Okay.

11                 THE COURT:     Thank you, ma'am.

12                 26, I have as the next one.        Nobody has anybody

13     between 21 and 26?       Okay.

14                 Mr. Fyffe, would you join us, please, sir?

15                 JUROR FYFFE:     Hello, Your Honor.

16                 THE COURT:     How are you, Mr. Fyffe?

17                 JUROR FYFFE:     Doing well.

18                 THE COURT:     I'm going to have to ask you about

19     those baseball analogies again.          During the questioning you

20     said that the Plaintiff would have a narrower strike zone

21     than the Defendant would have.

22                 JUROR FYFFE:     I figured that's what it was about.

23                 THE COURT:     That's what it's about.     Can you

24     explain that?     The real question is if you're selected to

25     serve and you end up on this jury and my instructions are to
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 120 of 135 PageID #: 16005

                                                                                    120




1      you that you have to base your decision solely on the

2      evidence that's admitted and nothing else, can you wait

3      until you hear all the evidence and can you make your

4      decisions solely on that evidence and can you treat these

5      two parties fairly and equally?           If you can, tell me.     If

6      you can't, then tell me.

7                   JUROR FYFFE:     I believe I can.     And let me try to

8      explain a little bit more in what I'm trying to do.              Most of

9      my life, I base my -- I go on first impressions.           And I've

10     been proven a lot of times those were wrong.           In working

11     with students at TSTC, I work with some -- a lot of

12     non-traditional students.           And when I walk into the class,

13     you know, I've got some students that have criminal problems

14     and other things.      I may or may not know that, but I

15     can't -- I may start off thinking that they're not going to

16     be able to do the work, but that don't mean I don't teach to

17     them.     I don't try to reach them.        In your analysis of the

18     shows, trying to guess the end, I would do that when I read

19     a book.     I try to figure out what's going on.        But once when

20     I think I have it, I don't close my mind and quit reading.

21     I still go to the end and make the final decision.

22                  THE COURT:     Okay.

23                  JUROR FYFFE:     Granted, I may be a little harder

24     listening.     I'm going to listen closer, okay?        Does that

25     make sense?     You see what I'm trying to say?
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 121 of 135 PageID #: 16006

                                                                                121




1                  MR. WARD:    Yeah.

2                  JUROR FYFFE:     I'm going to listen closer, but at

3      the same time, I'm still going to weigh the evidence against

4      everything.

5                  THE COURT:     Okay.    So what you're telling me, as I

6      understand it, is you, like everybody, has a first

7      impression --

8                  JUROR FYFFE:     Uh-huh.

9                  THE COURT:     And you're not going to be able to

10     take that first impression completely out of your mind, but

11     you're going to hear all the evidence and you're going to

12     consider all the evidence on both sides before you make any

13     final decisions?

14                 JUROR FYFFE:     Right.

15                 THE COURT:     Is that what you're telling me?

16                 JUROR FYFFE:     Yes.     And the -- and the first

17     impress -- a lot of times that first impression is totally

18     wrong, and my mind totally changes for them.

19                 THE COURT:     All right, sir.

20                 JUROR FYFFE:     But at the same time, I still feel

21     any time I see people arguing, I can a lot of times see both

22     sides and try and figure out -- a lot of times they're

23     saying the same thing.       And I feel I have the -- I've always

24     been very fortunate to try and figure out -- to see what

25     they're both trying to say and listen to what they're

1      saying.

2                  THE COURT:     Okay.     All right.   Mr. Ward, do you

3      have any questions of Mr. Fyffe?

4                  MR. WARD:     I don't have nothing further, Your

5      Honor.    Thank you.

6                  THE COURT:     Mr. Mann, do you have --

7                  MR. MANN:     None, Your Honor.

8                  THE COURT:     -- any questions?

9                  MR. MANN:     None, Your Honor.

10                 THE COURT:     Okay.     Mr. Fyffe, I'm going to let you

11     join the rest of the group outside.          Don't discuss anything

12     about what's happened in here, and we'll have you all back

13     in here shortly.

14                 JUROR FYFFE:     Okay.

15                 THE COURT:     Thank you.

16                 JUROR FYFFE:     Thank you.

17                 THE COURT:     Mr. Kyle, would you come up, please?

18     Good morning.

19                 JUROR KYLE:     Good morning.

20                 THE COURT:     Early on, Mr. Kyle, you indicated that

21     you might have -- early on, you indicated that you might

22     have a scheduling problem if you were selected on the jury

23     serving this week.       Tell me about that.

24                 JUROR KYLE:     Okay.     Back in January -- I go to the

25     VA, and two years ago they caught -- I had cancer.           And so

                                                                                123




1      it took me about, oh, five months, chemo, radiation, and

2      everything.     Well, that was a year and a half ago.        And so

3      I've been scheduled every six months to go have a PET scan

4      in which I did have one two weeks ago to make room for this

5      appointment and it's tomorrow.          But I didn't know that until

6      a week ago.

7                   THE COURT:    And that appointment is with your

8      doctor at the VA?

9                   JUROR KYLE:    Yes, sir, Dr. Adgeh.

10                  THE COURT:    Is that in Shreveport or where?

11                  JUROR KYLE:    Yes, sir, Shreveport.

12                  THE COURT:    All right.

13                  JUROR KYLE:    I wish I could, kind of, you know.

14                  THE COURT:    Have you ever had to reschedule an

15     appointment with the VA since you've been going there?

16     You've made every one of them?          So you don't have any idea

17     how long it would take for you to get back in if you had to

18     reschedule this one?

19                  JUROR KYLE:    That's the problem.

20                  THE COURT:    Okay.

21                  JUROR KYLE:    Is getting another appointment

22     afterward.     And I already had my PET scan, and I have to get

23     another one of them, too, because they don't last forever.

24                  THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, Mr. Kyle, if I can seat a

25     full jury without you, I will -- if I can seat a full jury

1      without you, I will let you go, but I've got to look at all

2      these notes and I'll -- I'm going to excuse you to join the

3      rest of the group outside, and we'll have you back in here

4      with everybody else in just a few minute minutes.           Just

5      don't discuss anything that's gone on in here.

6                  JUROR KYLE:     Kind of got that hint already.

7                  THE COURT:     Okay.     Well --

8                  JUROR KYLE:     There is another thing.      If you have

9      to have me --

10                 THE COURT:     Yes, sir.

11                 JUROR KYLE:     -- I can go -- I'll just go home and

12     make a call and tell them I cannot -- I'm in jury, so, you

13     know, if you get tight and you have to have one more.

14                 THE COURT:     If we don't have to, we won't.

15                 JUROR KYLE:     Okay.

16                 THE COURT:     All right.     You can join the rest of

17     the group outside.

18                 JUROR KYLE:     Thank you.

19                 THE COURT:     Thank you.

20                 Does anybody have anybody else on their list that

21     we haven't had up here?

22                 MR. MANN:     No, sir.

23                 THE COURT:     Okay.     We've got a total of 30.      All

24     right.    I'm going to excuse, 1, 5, 12, 14, 21, 28, and I'm

25     going to excuse 26.

1                  MR. WARD:    Not going to --

2                  THE COURT:    I am going to excuse 26.       That should

3      leave us -- that should leave us more than enough to select

4      a full jury.

6      right at noon now.

7                  MR. MANN:    20 minutes.

8                  THE COURT:    I'll give you 15, quarter after.

9                  MR. MANN:    Can I ask one thing, Your Honor?        Are

10     we going to strike three and one alternate, or are we just

11     striking four strikes?

12                 THE COURT:    You have four strikes.      If you want to

13     exercise them, exercise them all.        If you don't want to

14     exercise them, that's your call.

15                 MR. MANN:    Okay.

16                 THE COURT:    Okay.   All right.    Counsel, I'll see

17     you back in here in 15 minutes.

18                 (Bench conference concluded.)

19                 THE COURT:     All right.    Ladies and gentlemen,

20     we're going to recess for 15 minutes while counsel strikes

21     their lists and we'll be back in here thereafter.           We stand

22     in recess for the next 15 minutes.

23                 COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

24                 (Recess.)

1                  (Jury panel in.)

2                  THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

3                  Ladies and gentlemen, if you will listen carefully

4      as your name is called.       If you'll come forward and take

5      your seat in the jury box.       We're going to seat eight jury

6      members or eight jurors in this case.

7                  What I'd like to do is seat -- seat the first four

8      on the front row of the jury box and the second four on the

9      second row of the jury box.       And I'd also like to leave the

10     last two seats in each row vacant.

11                 So Juror No. 1, the first name that will be

12     called, you'll sit in the third seat from the end.           And that

13     will position our eight members pretty much in the center of

14     the jury box.

15                 So with that, Ms. Lockhart, our courtroom deputy,

16     will call the names of the members of the panel who have

17     been selected to serve as jurors in this case.

18                 COURTROOM DEPUTY:     Nancy Leflett, Patricia

19     Copeland, Cindy Hudgins, Sue Green, Anita Jones, Benjamin

20     Dupree, Reymundo Salazar, and Gregory Sweeten.

21                 THE COURT:    All right.    All of you that have not

22     been selected as jurors to serve in this case, I'm about to

23     excuse you.     I want to excuse you, Ladies and gentlemen,

24     with the sincere thanks of the Court.         I know this has been

25     a long morning.     I know that every one of you had other

1      places you could have been and other important things that

2      you could have been doing.       But you have -- even if you

3      weren't selected, you have performed a valuable public

4      service by being here.

5                  Trials like this cannot take place without willing

6      members of the community being willing to appear when

7      summonsed and present themselves for jury service, even if

8      having done that they're not selected to serve on the jury

9      that's impaneled.

10                 So let me just say one more time how much we

11     appreciate you being here and the service that you've

12     rendered.    The only thing I would ask is that when your name

13     comes up again, please come back and see us and please bring

14     the same constructive attitude with you that you brought

15     this morning.

16                 If you have any questions about your service, if

17     you need any information for your employer, if you're

18     looking for a place to turn in those lovely little badges

19     you've all been wearing, please see Ms. Martin at the

20     Clerk's Office on the way out for anything with regard to

21     your serving.

22                 With those instructions, you are excused at this

23     time with the Court's thanks.

24                 COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

1                  THE COURT:    All right.    If everyone, except the

2      jury, would be seated.      If the jury would remain standing,

3      please.

4                  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, Ms. Lockhart,

5      our courtroom deputy, will now administer the oath of jurors

6      to you.    If you'll raise your right hands, please.

7                  (Jurors sworn.)

8                  THE COURT:    All right.    Please be seated.

9                  I'm about to excuse you for lunch, Ladies and

10     Gentlemen of the Jury.      I do have a few instructions I need

11     to give you before I excuse you for lunch.

12                 One is that while you're on lunch and before we

13     start back this afternoon, I think it would be a very

14     helpful thing if you would go by the Clerk's Office and make

15     sure Mrs. Martin has cell phone numbers for you, any contact

16     information if for any reason we need to get you outside of

17     ordinary hours of operation.

18                 Also, there are two or three very important

19     instructions I need to give you at this time, and I'll ask

20     you to listen to these very carefully, and the first one is

21     probably the most important.

22                 Do not discuss the case with anyone.         Now that you

23     are members of this jury, it is absolutely vital that your

24     decisions that will be made, when you retire to the jury

25     room and deliberate upon your verdict, are based solely and
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 129 of 135 PageID #: 16014

                                                                                129




1      only on the sworn testimony that's presented during the

2      trial and the exhibits and other items that are admitted

3      into evidence by the Court.

4                  It is critical that no other influence be allowed

5      in this process.     Therefore, I'm instructing you not to

6      discuss the case both with each other until all the evidence

7      has been heard and I direct you to retire and deliberate

8      upon your verdict.      And also, you're not to discuss the case

9      with anyone else.      And I promise you when you go home this

10     evening, whoever is there to greet you, the first question

11     they're going to ask you is, well, tell me what happened in

12     federal court in Marshall today.

13                 Just simply say that the Judge down there made it

14     very clear to me I'm not to discuss the case at all, so I

15     just can't discuss it.      Blame it on me.     That goes -- that

16     goes with the territory.       It's part of my job.      But if you

17     ever answer that first question to try to tell them what

18     happened down here today, you will almost invariably go

19     further than you should and talk about the case.

20                 It is critical that you not discuss the case with

21     anyone, including the other members of the jury, until all

22     the evidence is heard and you then retire to deliberate.

23     When you retire to deliberate, having heard all the

24     evidence, it is your duty to discuss the case with the

25     remaining members of the jury.        But it is critical that your
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 130 of 135 PageID #: 16015

                                                                                 130




1      decision be limited to the sworn testimony and admitted

2      exhibits in this case, and no other influences whatsoever.

3      So do not discuss the case with anyone.

4                   And I -- I also want to warn you, Ladies and

5      Gentlemen -- and Mr. Salazar knows this, because he's served

6      on a jury since I've been on the bench -- you're going to

7      hear that same instruction from me all -- several times

8      every day.     And by the time this trial is over, you're going

9      to be very tired of hearing that instruction from me, but I

10     continue to give it because it is absolutely vital that you

11     observe it in every shape, form, and fashion so that there

12     is no outside influence, except the evidence that's admitted

13     during the course of the trial.

14                  Along these same lines, it may be that some of

15     you, perhaps several of you, are active participants with

16     social media that is so prevalent in today's society,

17     whether that be Facebook or Twitter or any of the -- any of

18     the other many, many avenues of social networking.

19                  When I say don't discuss the case, that means not

20     just a verbal conversation with somebody else.            That means

21     don't post anything on Facebook.        Don't e-mail anybody about

22     it.   Don't instant-message anybody.        Don't text.     Don't use

23     any form of communication:       Written, verbal, digital, any

24     shape, form of communication about the case with anyone.

25     That -- my instruction is as broad as I can make it.            So
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 131 of 135 PageID #: 16016

                                                                                 131




1      don't -- don't use any form of social media in commune -- in

2      attempting to communicate about the case with anyone.

3                  Also, Ladies and gentlemen, in regard to

4      electronic devices, I'm going to ask you not to bring your

5      cell phones with you into the courtroom, once we start the

6      evidence this afternoon.       Please leave them in your car.

7      We're going to have breaks every day.         If there's something

8      important that you're expecting an e-mail on, you certainly

9      will have opportunities to go to your car, check your

10     e-mail.    You'll have lunch hours every day.

11                 We don't want you disconnected from the wider

12     outside world, but it's very important that you not be

13     distracted in any way.      And I have a very firm rule that

14     except for the lawyers and their staff trying the case,

15     there are no other electronics permitted in the courtroom.

16     I guarantee you my cell phone will not go off during the

17     trial, because I never bring it into the courtroom.           It's

18     never on the bench with me.

19                 So leave your cell phones in your vehicles.

20     You're welcome to leave them at home, if you don't care, but

21     don't bring them into the courtroom with you.

22                 Also, I don't know if this will happen.         It's very

23     rare, but this is a very important case, and there's a

24     serious dispute between these parties.         And any time you

25     have an important case with a serious dispute like this,
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 132 of 135 PageID #: 16017

                                                                                132




1      it's always possible, now that you are the eight members of

2      this jury, that somebody might attempt to approach you in

3      some improper fashion, whether someone tries to influence

4      you, whether someone would try to offer you a bribe, whether

5      someone would try to communicate with you in any way that's

6      improper.     That's not likely, but it's possible.

7                   And so I need to put you on notice that it could

8      happen.     And let me just simply tell you that if at any

9      time, before you're excused from your service as jurors in

10     this case after you've rendered a verdict, at any time

11     before that, if anyone -- anyone approaches you in any way

12     that you perceive is improper or something other than it

13     should be, then you -- I'm instructing you to advise the

14     Court about it immediately.

15                  You should do that by contacting Ms. Martin in the

16     Clerk's Office.     She'll inform me and the Court will deal

17     with it.     Again, I don't think it's likely, but it is

18     possible.     And so I want to put you on notice about that.

19                  Also, ladies and gentlemen, you are not to do any

20     research about the subjects that may come up in this case.

21     You're -- again, your decision as jurors must be based

22     solely upon the evidence that comes in during the trial in

23     this courtroom under oath and subject to cross-examination.

24     That means don't get on Google or Yahoo! or any other search

25     engine.     Don't use the computer or the Internet to do any
Case 2:12-cv-00089-JRG Document 385 Filed 07/21/14 Page 133 of 135 PageID #: 16018

                                                                                133




1      research about guardrail end caps or any -- or Trinity

2      Industries or Joshua Harman or anybody else.          Don't do

3      anything to try and investigate or learn from any other

4      source about this case.

5                  Your knowledge and the information and facts that

6      you will base your decision on, again, must come solely from

7      the evidence that's produced under oath from the witness

8      stand subject to cross-examination in open court and those

9      exhibits that the Court's expressly admits into evidence.

10                 That is the entire universe of the knowledge from

11     which you must make your decision as jurors.          So don't

12     attempt to do any research.       Don't allow anyone to give you

13     or tender to you any outside influences.

14                 And lastly, before I let you go to lunch, there

15     are a large number of lawyers in this case, and there's a

16     large number of paralegals and staff with each of these

17     trial teams.     I want you to know that in a small courthouse

18     like this, invariably, you will pass by one or more of the

19     people who are active participants in this trial, either the

20     lawyers or their staff.

21                 They're not going to speak to you when they pass

22     by you on the steps out front or going to down the hallway

23     or at any time that you run into them at a restaurant in

24     town over a lunch break.       And I want you to understand they

25     are not going to speak to you because I've instructed them

                                                                                134




1      not to.

2                   So if somebody from one side or the other walks by

3      you on the sidewalk, don't think, well, that person was just

4      rude; they should have answered my hello or they should have

5      stopped and been friendly.       They're not allowed to do that,

6      and I've instructed them not to do that.          So don't hold that

7      against them.     Don't think ill of them in any way, if they

8      follow my instruction, because that is my instruction to

9      them.

10                  All right.    Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to

11     excuse you for lunch at this time.         And I'm going to ask you

12     to be back in the courtroom at 1:40 assembled in the jury

13     room.     And we will try to start as close to 1:45 as we can.

14     That should give you just about a full hour to enjoy your

15     lunch break.     Don't discuss the case with yourselves or with

16     anyone else.

17                  With those instructions, you're now excused for

18     lunch.

19                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:     All rise.

20                  (Jury out.)

21                  THE COURT:    All right.   Counsel, I'm going to

22     allow you a brief time for lunch, but given the number of

23     disputed matters that were raised with the Court this

24     morning, I'm going to direct counsel for both sides to be in

25     the courtroom by 1:15.       We'll try to deal with as many

1      matters as we can before we bring the jury back in 30

2      minutes later.

3                  With that, counsel in this case stands in recess

4      until 1:15.

5                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.
