# Feature 02N Implementation

## Overview
Feature 02N addresses attorney association and multi-trial support with three main components:
1. Law firm/office parsing and association (COMPLETED)
2. Multi-trial attorney identification (PENDING)
3. Generic attorney fallback for unattributed Q&A (PENDING)

## Part A: Law Firm Association (COMPLETED)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Schema Update
- Modified `LawFirmOffice.addressId` to be optional (nullable) in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- This allows law firm offices to be created without addresses when not available

#### 2. MultiPassContentParser Enhancement
- Updated to use `SummaryPageParser` for extracting attorney and law firm information
- Added imports for `SummaryPageParser` and `AttorneyService`
- Modified `parseSummaryForSpeakers()` to organize lines by pages for proper parsing
- Added `parseJudgeFromSummaryInfo()` method to handle judge info from SummaryPageParser

#### 3. AttorneyService Fix
- Fixed office creation logic to handle null addresses
- Changed `addressId: addressId!` to `addressId: addressId` to allow nullable values

### Results
Law firms are now successfully:
- Parsed from transcript headers using existing `SummaryPageParser`
- Associated with attorneys in the `TrialAttorney` junction table
- Stored with their addresses when available

### Testing Verification
```sql
SELECT a.name as attorney, lf.name as law_firm 
FROM "Attorney" a 
LEFT JOIN "TrialAttorney" ta ON a.id = ta."attorneyId" 
LEFT JOIN "LawFirm" lf ON ta."lawFirmId" = lf.id 
ORDER BY lf.name, a.name;
```

Successfully shows attorneys associated with their law firms:
- FABRICANT LLP: 5 attorneys
- FENWICK & WEST LLP: 3 attorneys
- HALTOM & DOAN: 3 attorneys
- KNOBBE, MARTENS, OLSON & BEAR, LLP: 2 attorneys
- MCKOOL SMITH, P.C.: 2 attorneys
- THE DACUS FIRM, PC: 1 attorney

## Part B: Multi-Trial Attorney Support (PENDING)

### Planned Implementation

#### 1. Add Attorney Fingerprinting
- Add `attorneyFingerprint` field to Attorney table
- Generate fingerprint from name components (firstName, lastName, middleInitial, suffix)
- Use Bar number as secondary validation when available

#### 2. Update MultiTrialSpeakerService
- Implement attorney deduplication logic
- Match attorneys across trials using fingerprint
- Maintain trial-specific associations in TrialAttorney

#### 3. Speaker Handle Scoping
- Keep speaker handles trial-scoped (current behavior)
- Attorney records can be shared across trials
- TrialAttorney maintains trial-specific details (law firm, office, role)

## Part C: Generic Attorney Fallback (PENDING)

### Planned Implementation

#### 1. Create Generic Speakers
- Add `isGeneric` boolean to Speaker table
- Create PLAINTIFF_ATTORNEY and DEFENSE_ATTORNEY generic speakers per trial

#### 2. Examination State Tracking
- Track current examination type and side
- Use state to attribute unattributed Q patterns
- Maintain context throughout testimony

#### 3. Configuration Support
- Support different Q&A patterns (Q., Q:, QUESTION:)
- Configurable via trialstyle.json

## Files Modified

### Completed
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Made LawFirmOffice.addressId optional
