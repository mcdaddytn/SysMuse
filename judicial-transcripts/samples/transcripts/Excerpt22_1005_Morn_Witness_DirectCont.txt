08:33:38    5   Q.   Good morning, Mr. McAlexander.

08:33:40    6   A.   Good morning, sir.

08:33:42    7               MR. RUBINO:   If we could please, Mr. Thompson,

08:33:48    8   have Slide Demonstrative 10.       Slide 10, please.

08:33:53    9   Q.   (By Mr. Rubino)      Mr. McAlexander, can you refresh us as

08:33:57   10   to what we were discussing on Friday regarding your

08:33:59   11   analysis?

08:34:00   12   A.   Yes.    We were just starting the claim construction

08:34:02   13   analysis, looking at Claim 1 of the '049 patent.            And we

08:34:07   14   were generally describing what -- what is before you in

08:34:12   15   this slide is a demonstrative that recites the language

08:34:17   16   from the claim.

08:34:18   17               And I have specifically inserted the bracketed

08:34:21   18   letters [A] through [F] so that as I navigate step-by-step

08:34:26   19   through this claim, it would help the jury hopefully to

08:34:31   20   orient or can stay oriented as to exactly where we are in

08:34:37   21   the claim analysis.

08:34:38   22               MR. RUBINO:   Mr. Thompson, if we could have

08:34:41   23   Slide 15, please?

08:34:42   24   Q.   (By Mr. Rubino)      And, Mr. McAlexander, if you could

08:34:45   25   refresh us as to what you were talking about on Friday with
