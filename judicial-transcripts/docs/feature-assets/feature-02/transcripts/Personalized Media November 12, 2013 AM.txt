15                        (Jury panel in.)

16                        COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

17                        THE COURT:      Thank you.     Be seated,

18   please.

19                        Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.             I

20   want to thank each one of you for being here this

21   morning.       My name is Rodney Gilstrap.          I am the resident

22   United States District Judge for the Marshall Division

23   of the Eastern District of Texas.

24                        I have lived in Marshall since 1981.                I

25   practiced law in the Marshall and surrounding area for

                                  10254

1    just over 30 years before I took the bench in 2011.

2                        I was born and went through high school

3    in Florida, came to Texas to go to Baylor University,

4    stayed and went to Baylor Law School.              I am married.       I

5    have two grown children.          My wife owns and operates a

6    retail floral shop here in Marshall.

7                        Now, I tell you all those things because

8    in a few minutes, I'm going to ask you to answer similar

9    questions, and I think it's only fair that I tell you as

10   much about me as I'm about to learn about each of

11   you-all.

12                        We're about to engage in the selection of

13   a jury in a civil case involving allegations of patent

14   infringement.        I know that you've seen the film this

15   morning about patent cases since they do involve certain

16   issues and things that are not common in other civil

17   cases.

18                        In civil cases such as this one, the

19   United States of America is the only country in the

20   world that guarantees the right to a trial by jury in a

21   civil case.       By being here this morning and

22   participating in this jury selection process, each of

23   you, as ordinary citizens, are in a very real sense

24   doing your part to preserve, protect, and defend our

25   Constitution, the rights guaranteed to all of our
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 4 of 106 PageID #:
                                  10255
4   


1    citizens under it, particularly those rights to a trial

2    by jury in a civil case set forth in the Seventh

3    Amendment, which is a part of our Bill of Rights.

4                        I always tell jurors, and I believe it

5    more each time, that jury service, in my personal view,

6    is the second highest form of public service that any

7    citizen of our country can perform.              Of course, the

8    highest form of public service, in my view, are those

9    young men and women that are active and participate in

10   our United States armed forces and protect our rights by

11   putting their lives on the line.

12                        Now, when the lawyers address you later

13   this morning, they're going to ask you questions, and I

14   want you to understand they are not intentionally

15   seeking to inquire into your private affairs unduly.

16   They're entitled to ask questions for the purpose of

17   securing a fair and impartial jury to hear this case.

18                        I don't know if it will happen today.              It

19   rarely does, but I want you to know that occasionally in

20   the jury selection process, a member of the panel will

21   get a question that they view to be so personal that

22   they're very uncomfortable answering that question in

23   front of the members -- the other members of the jury

24   panel.      I don't think that will happen, but it is

25   possible.

1                        If it should happen, then you just need

2    to simply say that you'd like to discuss that with Judge

3    Gilstrap, and I'll make an accommodation so that you can

4    answer that question outside the presence of all other

5    members of the panel.         Again, that rarely happens, but I

6    want you to be aware that option does exist.

7                        The important thing this morning is when

8    you're asked questions by the lawyers is to give full,

9    complete, and truthful answers.            As long as your

10   responses are full, complete, and truthful, there are no

11   wrong answers.

12                        The trial in this case is going to begin

13   later today.        We will use most of the morning to select

14   and seat the jury in this case, and then after a lunch

15   break, we will start with the evidence in this case.                    So

16   the trial will actually begin today, and I anticipate

17   that it will run probably two or three -- through

18   Tuesday of next week.          That's a guess, but that's my

19   best guess about the length of the trial.

20                        So those of you that are selected to

21   serve on this jury will need to be available from today

22   through Tuesday of next week.             And so I need to ask at

23   this time if there are any members of the panel who

24   either have a surgical procedure scheduled for

25   themselves or they have non-refundable travel tickets

1    that can't be turned back in or if there's any other

2    circumstance that would prevent you from being here from

3    today through Tuesday of next week.

4                        If any of you fall in that category,

5    would you raise your hands and let me make a note of

6    that.

7                        I don't see a single hand.          So that's --

8    that's easy.       Thank you.

9                        At this time, I'm going to call for

10   announcements in the case of Personalized Media

11   Communications, LLC versus Zynga, Inc.                This is Civil

12   Action 2:12-CV-68.

13                        Counsel, as you give your announcements

14   this morning, please identify yourselves and each of the

15   members of your trial team.            Also please identify your

16   corporate representatives that you have with you.                   We'll

17   start with the Plaintiff.

18                        What says the Plaintiff?

19                        MR. HILL:     Good morning, Your Honor.

4    Longview.

5                        The corporate representatives I'd like to

6    introduce to the jury are the principals of PMC.                  First

7    off, we have Mr. John Harvey.            Mr. Harvey is the

8    inventor of the patents.          You'll hear that.

9                        His co-inventor of those patents is a

10   gentleman by the name of Mr. Jim Cuddihy sitting there

11   next to him.

12                        Mr. Harvey's wife, Ms. Kazie Metzger,

13   also Kazie Metzger you'll also see her through the

14   trial.      She is also a principal of PMC and here to

15   support Mr. Harvey.

16                        And then the president of PMC, Mr. Gerald

17   Holtzman.       Mr. Holtzman is a principal in the company

18   and also here for our trial.

19                        Thank you, Your Honor.

20                        THE COURT:      Thank you, Mr. Hill.

21                        What says the Defendant?

22                        MS. SMITH:      Good morning, Your Honor.

23   Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.

24                        I join Mr. Hill in thanking each of you

25   for your time this morning.            My name is Melissa Smith.

1    I'm a Marshall, Texas, lawyer and I'll be working with

2    lead counsel for Zynga, Mr. Steve Zager.

3                        MR. ZAGER:      Good morning.

4                        MR. HILL:     Mr. Zager and I will also be

5    joined by Mr. Todd Landis.

6                        MR. LANDIS:      Good morning.

7                        MS. SMITH:      You'll be hearing from him

8    quite a bit in this case.

9                        And then I'm also proud to introduce

10   Mr. Dorion Carroll.          Mr. Dorion Carroll is our corporate

11   representative of Zynga.           He'll be here each day of

12   trial, and you'll also be available to visit with

13   Mr. Zynga when he testifies in this case.

14                        And, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.

15                        THE COURT:      Thank you, Ms. Smith.

16                        Ladies and Gentlemen, as I mentioned,

17   this is a patent case arising from the laws -- the

18   patent laws of the United States.              What the Plaintiff is

19   claiming in this case is that its patents were infringed

20   by the Defendant, and they are seeking money damages

21   because of that infringement.

22                        The Defendant denies that they have

23   infringed the Plaintiff's patents and contends that the

24   patents are invalid.

25                        Now, what I've just told you is a very
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 9 of 106 PageID #:
                                  10260
9   


1    informal shorthand way of describing the case in

2    layman's terms.        Having seen the patent film, you

3    probably know more about patent cases than most people

4    do when they arrive at the courthouse.

5                        As I mentioned earlier, when the lawyers

6    question you in a few minutes, it is critical that your

7    answers be full, complete, and truthful.               Again, as long

8    as they meet that standard, there are no wrong answers.

9                        And as I mentioned, the lawyers are not

10   attempting to pry unduly into your personal affairs.

11   They're simply discharging their responsibility to their

12   clients to gather necessary information to secure a jury

13   that is fair and impartial in this case.

14                        I don't think any of the lawyers this

15   morning will ask you any improper questions.                 They're

16   all experienced trial lawyers who are well aware of the

17   rules of this Court and the rules of civil procedure.

18                        Certainly if they do, I will stop them,

19   but I don't anticipate that will be a problem this

20   morning.

21                        One thing I want to call to your

22   attention, particularly because some of the lawyers may

23   ask you about your ability to apply this during the

24   trial, is the burden of proof in a patent case.                  Those

25   of you that are chosen to serve on the jury in this case
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 10 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10261

1    will be called upon to -- to apply two different burdens

2    of proof.

3                        The selected jury may apply the burden of

4    proof known as the preponderance of the evidence as well

5    as a different burden of proof known as clear and

6    convincing evidence.         I need to instruct you that when a

7    party has the burden of proof of either a claim or

8    defense by a preponderance of the evidence, it means

9    that you, the jury, must be persuaded by the credible or

10   believable evidence that the claim or defense is more

11   probably true than not true.

12                       I'll say that again.        More probably true

13   than not true.        Sometimes this is talked about as being

14   the greater weight and degree of credible testimony.

15                       Let me give you an illustration.            I think

16   all of you can see in front of our court reporter the

17   statue of the Lady of Justice in our courtroom.                 In her

18   right hand, she holds the sword of justice.                In the left

19   hand, she holds the scales of justice.

20                       In this case, the jury will hear the

21   evidence from all the parties, and when all the evidence

22   is in, they'll be asked to decide certain questions and

23   apply the burden of proof of a preponderance of the

24   evidence.

25                       In putting all that evidence on those
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 11 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10262
11  


1    scales in deciding whether the party who has that burden

2    of proof has met it, if that party who has the burden of

3    proof by a preponderance of the evidence has those

4    scales, when all the evidence is placed upon them, tip

5    in their direction, even if it tips -- those scales tip

6    ever so slightly, then that party has met the burden of

7    proof beyond -- or excuse me -- has met the burden of

8    proof of the preponderance of the evidence.

9                        But on the other hand, when a party has

10   the burden of proving a defense by clear and convincing

11   evidence, it means that the jury must have an abiding

12   conviction of the truth of that party's factual

13   contentions and that those contentions are highly

14   probable.

15                       Clear and convincing evidence is a higher

16   standard of proof than a preponderance of the evidence.

17   If you -- if you think about the same example I just

18   gave you, when all the evidence is in and placed on

19   those scales, the party who has a burden by clear and

20   convincing evidence must have those scales tip in their

21   favor more than ever so slightly.             They must definitely

22   tip in that party's direction.

23                       So as you hear the evidence, don't be

24   confused about these burdens of proof.

25                       Also, Ladies and Gentlemen, many of you

1    have heard of a burden of proof in the media and in

2    television called beyond a reasonable doubt.                That's the

3    burden of proof applied in a criminal case.                It has no

4    application here.        So don't confuse any of this with

5    beyond a reasonable doubt.

6                        Clear and convincing evidence is a higher

7    standard of proof than a preponderance of the evidence,

8    but it is not as high a standard as beyond a reasonable

9    doubt.

10                       I give you these instructions because

11   it's quite probable that some of the lawyers will ask

12   you about your ability to apply these two burdens of

13   proof, if you're selected to serve on this jury.

14                       Now, before the lawyers actually begin

15   their questioning of the jury panel, we're going to let

16   each of you all give me the same type of information I

17   gave you when I came out this morning.

18                       You'll see on the screen that there are

19   nine questions, and this is how we're going to proceed

20   at this point.        Our Court Security Officer is going to

21   hand each of you a portable microphone, and if you will

22   stand, when you get that microphone, and then answer

23   those nine questions.         And then we'll move the

24   microphone to the next person.            They can stand and

25   answer the same nine questions.

1                        Because it helps significantly for

2    everyone in the courtroom to hear you, please wait until

3    you have the handheld microphone before you begin to

4    answer; otherwise, we may not be able to hear you.

5                        Also please stand when you answer any

6    question with the handheld microphone.

7                        And also after you've given these nine

8    answers to these nine questions, when the jury is -- is

9    examined by the lawyers, if any of you are asked a

10   specific question, we'll follow the same procedure.                  You

11   should stand and use the handheld mic and wait until you

12   get the handheld mic to answer any of the questions that

13   any of the lawyers propound to you as part of the

14   examination.

15                       All right.     With that, we'll start with

16   Panel Member No. 1.         And, sir, if you'll stand and

17   answer those nine questions for us.

23   She's been there probably 12 years, I think, now.                 I

24   have served on a civil jury, which was -- I guess you

25   would call it civil.         It was a child custody case.

1    there 34 years.        I went to Marshall High School.

2                        My wife's name is Betty.         She worked --

3    last job was Marshall Heritage House, but she's not

4    working now.       She's hurt.      And I've never served on a

5    jury before.

6                        THE COURT:     Thank you, sir.

7                        Thank you very much, Ladies and

8    Gentlemen.      I need to say a couple more things to you

9    before we begin the questioning by the lawyers.

10                       The jurors that are selected today to

11   comprise this jury will serve as the judges of the

12   facts, and they will make the sole determination about

13   what the facts are in this case.             My job as the judge is

14   to rule on questions of law and evidence, procedure, to

15   control the courtroom and the flow of the trial.

16                       Also, Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to say

17   a couple things to you about our judicial system that I

18   believe will help put things in a proper perspective for

19   you.

20                       In any jury trial, in addition to the

21   actual parties, there are always three participants:

22   The jurors, the judge, and the lawyers.

23                       With regard to the lawyers, I think it's

24   important for each of you to understand that our

25   judicial system is an adversary system, which means
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 26 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10277
26  


1    simply that during each trial, the parties will seek to

2    present their respective cases to the jury in the very

3    best light possible.

4                        Now, lawyers are frequently criticized in

5    the media, and the Court has come to observe that that

6    is often the result of a misunderstanding about our

7    adversary system in which the lawyers act as advocates

8    for the competing parties.

9                        As an advocate, a lawyer is ethically and

10   legally obligated to zealously assert his or her

11   client's position within the rules of our adversary

12   system.

13                       And by presenting the very best case

14   possible on behalf of their clients, the lawyers

15   hopefully will enable the jury to better weigh the

16   relevant evidence and determine the truth and arrive at

17   a just verdict based on that evidence.

18                       This system of justice has served our

19   nation well for over 200 years, and America's lawyers

20   have been and continue to be a critical and vital part

21   of that process.

22                       So as we go forward during the trial,

23   even though I might occasionally frown at the lawyers

24   from time to time, that's just because I'm trying to

25   make sure that they stay within the bounds of our
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 27 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10278
27  


1    adversary system.

2                        But keep in mind they are doing their

3    jobs as advocates on behalf of their clients, and I

4    think that's important for all of you to understand as

5    we go forward.

6                        Also, I want you to know that during the

7    trial of this case, I will do my very best to make sure

8    that you have no idea about what I personally think

9    about the evidence that the jury hears.               That's the

10   jury's job to evaluate the evidence, not mine.

11                       Accordingly, the jury should not take any

12   expressions that they see from me as something to

13   consider or as a factor to take into account when making

14   your decisions about the ultimate facts in this case.

15                       At this time, we'll hear from the lawyers

16   for each side.

17                       Mr. Hill, you may address the panel.

18                       MR. HILL:     Thank you, Your Honor.

19                       THE COURT:     Would you like a warning on

20   your time?

21                       MR. HILL:     Please, Your Honor, when I

22   have five minutes remaining.

23                       THE COURT:     All right.      You may proceed.

24                       MR. HILL:     Thank you, Your Honor.

25                       Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.            My

1    name is Wesley Hill.         I grew up over in Murchison,

2    Texas, which is over in Henderson County.               Practice law

3    in Longview now with the Ward & Smith Law Firm, and it's

4    my privilege in this case to represent Personalized

5    Media Communications.         You'll hear us refer to it as

6    short -- shorthand throughout the trial as PMC.                 So it's

7    my privilege to represent PMC.

8                        Before I start this morning, I want to

9    take a moment to say thank you to you folks for being

10   here.     I understand this is an imposition.            You're

11   taking a day out of your life, a day off work, a day

12   away from your families, to come down and hear about a

13   case, sit in an uncomfortable courtroom that, you know,

14   you don't feel all that comfortable sitting in, listen

15   to a bunch of lawyers talk to you.

16                       It is a necessary part of our litigant

17   system.      And I know it's an imposition, but we want to

18   say thank you for being here.            This is a case that's

19   very important to PMC, to our company.              And we, frankly,

20   need the jury's help to get it resolved.

21                       So thank you.      You'll hear me throughout

22   the case continue to thank those of you who are the

23   lucky eight to spend the week with us.              I know we ask

24   y'all to drive a long distance to get here, and I

25   just -- I just can't say it enough that I appreciate

1    your time and your energy to be here this morning.

2                        Folks, as I told you earlier, my client

3    is Personalized Media Communications, PMC.               May not have

4    ever heard of PMC.         They were founded in 1981 by

5    Mr. John Harvey, Mr. Harvey here, who you met earlier.

6                        Mr. Harvey is the inventor, along with

7    Mr. Cuddihy, of the patents that are involved in this

8    lawsuit.

9                        PMC's inventions that were developed by

10   Mr. Harvey and Mr. Cuddihy enable a way to provide

11   interactive multimedia experiences that are both

12   personalized and shared and use both local and remote

13   computers.

14                       That's what this case is about.           You'll

15   learn more about that as we go on.             It's about

16   interactive multimedia computer interaction.

17                       We're here today because Zynga, the

18   Defendant in this case, uses these inventions in their

19   games.     PMC's business is the development and licensing

20   of these technologies, these interactive technologies,

21   to companies that desire to use the innovations.

22                       The CEO of PMC is Ms. Kazie Metzger, who

23   we introduced to you earlier.            Ms. Metzger is

24   Mr. Harvey's wife.         The president of PMC is Mr. Gerald

25   Holtzman, who you met earlier.
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 30 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10281
30  


1                        You'll learn as the case goes on that Mr.

2    Holtzman and Ms. Metzger went to high school together in

3    Corpus Christi, Texas.          You'll also hear from most of

4    these folks during the course of the trial.                What you'll

5    learn is that PMC is a family-run, family-owned

6    business.

7                        Now, the facts of our case will come out

8    during the opening statements.            And this is not our

9    opportunity to -- to make an opening statement to you.

10   That -- as Judge Gilstrap instructed you earlier, there

11   are rules that apply to our process, and that would not

12   be what the rules allow.          This is our chance to talk to

13   you.

14                       So for now, all you need to know about

15   the case is that it relates to whether Zynga infringes

16   the asserted patents that were invented by Mr. Harvey

17   and whether Zynga can prove that those patents are

18   somehow invalid and what a reasonable royalty would be

19   that Zynga would owe for its use of those patented

20   technologies without PMC's permission.

21                       THE COURT:     Let's move on to specific

22   questions, Counsel.

23                       MR. HILL:     Yes, sir, Your Honor.

24                       Now, as -- as Judge Gilstrap told you,

25   the only rule of jury selection is that you speak up.

1    This is my only chance to hear from you, and I only get

2    30 minutes to do it.

3                        So I want to ask you some questions.

4    There are no wrong answers, and I want you to

5    understand, what we're looking for is a jury that's

6    going to be fair and impartial to both sides.

7                        You'll hear me refer to what's called

8    bias and prejudice.         If I called you biased and

9    prejudiced outside of the courtroom, you'd probably slap

10   my face.      It doesn't mean the bad words in the courtroom

11   that they mean outside the courtroom.              It just means you

12   might have life experiences that make you start out

13   leaning toward one side or the other, not that

14   down-the-middle juror we're looking for.

15                       So I mentioned that this is a lawsuit.

16   So I want to start there.           I want to talk about lawsuits

17   a little bit.

18                       How many agree with this statement?

19   There are too many lawsuits in the world?               Too many

20   lawsuits?

21                       I agree with that.        I'll raise my hand

22   and agree with that.         There are too many lawsuits.

23   There are even frivolous lawsuits, inmates suing for

24   more TV time, you know, other kinds of things that just

25   don't merit folks taking time out of their life to come

1    to the courtroom.

2                        I want to talk to some of you who have

3    had experiences being a defendant in a lawsuit.                 Is

4    there anybody on our jury panel that has ever had the

5    experience personally of having been sued?

6                        All right.     We've got a couple of hands.

7    We've got Mr. Newsom some here, No. 1.

8                        Mr. Newsom, what can you tell me about

9    that?

10                       JUROR NEWSOM:      When I was working as a

11   police officer for Daingerfield, the city was sued, and

12   I was included in the suit.           It was, I think, 2004, if I

13   remember right.

14                       MR. HILL:     Okay.

15                       JUROR NEWSOM:      Anyway, it was from an

16   arrest on an assault on a public servant.               He sued for

17   wrongful imprisonment, among other things.               And it

18   was -- me, the city, mayor, chief of police, as well as

19   the city manager were all named in the suit.

20                       And as far as the case goes, it went to

21   the jury and found not liable or --

22                       MR. HILL:     Okay.    Well, thank you.       Thank

23   you for letting me know about that.

24                       Let me ask you a question while you still

25   have the microphone.         I think it's pretty obvious why I

1    ask this question.         We're the Plaintiff in this lawsuit

2    suing somebody.        I suspect you didn't like it too much.

3    Most people don't.

4                        Is there anything about that experience

5    in your life that you think would start you out leaning

6    toward Zynga a little bit because they're in the

7    circumstance you were in; they're being sued in a

8    lawsuit?

9                        JUROR NEWSOM:      No.    I don't think there's

10   anything that would -- I mean, make me feel one way or

11   the other.

12                       MR. HILL:     Thank you, sir.       I trust you.

13   We had one other over here.           I think it was -- I saw --

14   was that Mr. Greer?

15                       Mr. Greer, No. 17.

16                       JUROR GREER:      Yes, sir.     I was included

17   in many lawsuits over the years when I worked for PPG,

18   but I don't remember the exact year, but a few years

19   ago, I was sued personally over some property.                It took

20   about five years to settle.           It cost me $10,000.

21   It turned out it was really a frivolous lawsuit that was

22   more because the people that bought some property from

23   me had a brother that was an attorney in Alabama, and --

24   and he was thinking he was going to get some quick money

25   from the insurance company, which I did not get my

                                   10285
34  


1    insurance company involved in it, because my attorney

2    said:     Hey, this is a dumb thing.

3                        And it really was.        Even the judge down

4    in Panola told me that.          But it cost me 10 grand that I

5    can't get back, you know, so...

6                        MR. HILL:     Yes, sir.     Yes, sir.     You've

7    had that life experience.           Zynga is the Defendant in

8    this lawsuit.       We're suing them over a property right.

9    We own patents, and we say they're trespassing.

10                       Do you think that life experience of

11   yours might start you out maybe feeling for Zynga

12   because you've been there yourself?

13                       JUROR GREER:      That's a hard question to

14   answer.      I don't think it would because I'm a person

15   that likes to look at facts and weigh them out honestly.

16   I did have a bad experience.           It did cost me 10 grand

17   for nothing.

18                       MR. HILL:     Sure.

19                       JUROR GREER:      And -- and I mean, it was

20   actually thrown out of court and said, hey, this -- you

21   know, this is -- but -- but it still cost me money and

22   it cost me time.

23                       MR. HILL:     Yes, sir.

24                       Now, based on that, do you think it

25   causes you to have a little more jaundiced eye toward

35  


1    PMC because they're the person making this claim saying

2    somebody's trespassing on their patent?

3                        JUROR GREER:      Could.

4                        MR. HILL:     Could.     Okay.

5                        All right.     Well, I appreciate your

6    candor.      Thank you, sir.

7                        Anybody else, defendant in a lawsuit?

8                        Let me ask more broadly.           Anybody here

9    ever been a defendant in a lawsuit because of their

10   business?

11                       I know Mr. Newsom had to do it with his

12   employment a little bit.

13                       You mentioned PPG, Mr. Greer.           Is that

14   the paint company PPG?

15                       JUROR GREER:      Yes.

16                       MR. HILL:     Were those asbestos suits or

17   something?

18                       JUROR GREER:      No, sir.       These were

19   coatings.      This was -- several of the suits were like in

20   Mississippi, one up in Alabama, and it was involving

21   people back from the EPA era when they weren't required

22   to wear respirators and people got lung diseases and

23   stuff.

24                       And so they sued multiple companies.

25   They sued PPG, Dupont, Sherwin Williams, and anybody who

1    was in management was named in the suit.

2                        MR. HILL:     Yes, sir.

3                        JUROR GREER:      And then one of the suits

4    was where we had filed suit against a customer which was

5    a distributor, for non-payment.            It was about $750,000

6    that he was behind owed us, and he turned around and

7    sued us for a whole list of things.

8                        MR. HILL:     Okay.    Is there anybody else

9    like Mr. Greer has been involved in lawsuits in their

10   business, been defendants in lawsuits in their business?

11                       Now, let me ask this:        Is there anyone

12   here who feels they already start out leaning possibly

13   toward one side or the other, particularly leaning

14   toward Zynga, because they're the party that's been sued

15   because PMC brought this lawsuit?

16                       You just identify with them or feel, you

17   know, they're the defendant in the lawsuit and you feel

18   like that put you leaning in their favor?               Anybody feel

19   that way?

20                       Again, there's nothing wrong with it.             We

21   all have different feelings based on life experiences.

22                       Let me ask you this question:           It's --

23   tell me if you agree or you disagree by a show of hands.

24                       If you agree with this statement, please

25   raise your hand for me:          Large corporations typically

1    violate contracts unintentionally.             Large corporations

2    typically violate contracts unintentionally.

3                        Who feels like they agree with that

4    statement?      Anybody?

5                        No.

6                        Okay.    Let me ask this with regard to

7    lawsuits generally:         Is there anyone who is a member or

8    active with social justice organizations, like, for

9    instance, the ACLU or maybe East Texans Against Lawsuit

10   Abuse or Texas Watch?

11                       Anybody that's a member of those

12   organizations or support those organizations or involved

13   in other social justice organizations that have to do

14   with the legal system?          Anybody?

15                       Well, very good.

16                       Well, who has heard of Zynga before

17   today?

18                       We've got several hands right here in the

19   front.     That's Ms. Blankenship.         You've heard of Zynga.

20   What do you know about them?

21                       JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        I only know that I

22   see it on my phone when I play Words with Friends.

23                       MR. HILL:     Okay.    Play Words with

24   Friends.      Anything about your experience as an -- as a

25   game player of a Zynga game that you think would

38  


1    influence your feelings in this case?

2                        JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        No.

3                        MR. HILL:     No okay.     Thank you, ma'am.

4                        Who else do we have?        We have a few other

5    hands behind -- we have No. 12 there.                That's

6    Mr. Prince.       How do you know Zynga?

7                        JUROR PRINCE:      Oh, like she said, just

8    playing their -- playing their games.                Play FarmVille,

9    Words with Friends, that kind of thing.

10                       MR. HILL:     Do you do that regularly?

11                       JUROR PRINCE:      No, not really.

12                       MR. HILL:     Anything about that that you

13   think would influence your feelings in this case?

14                       JUROR PRINCE:      No.

15                       MR. HILL:     If you heard the evidence and

16   believe you had to make a decision against Zynga that

17   make those games, do you think you could do it?

18                       JUROR PRINCE:      Yes, sir.

19                       MR. HILL:     All right.        Next to you there,

20   also Mr. Parker?

21                       JUROR PARKER:      Yes, sir.       Same thing,

22   I've played a couple of their games in the past year.

23                       So no reason why --

24                       MR. HILL:     Let me ask you the same

25   question.      Anything about that you think, if the
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 39 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10290
39  


1    evidence showed you need to make a decision adverse to

2    Zynga, would prevent you from doing that?

3                        JUROR PARKER:      No, sir.

4                        MR. HILL:     All right.      I appreciate that.

5                        Was there anybody else I missed who are

6    familiar with Zynga.         We've got a few out here in the

7    back.     Let's -- let's hear from them as well.

8                        JUROR PRICE:      I played FarmVille a few

9    years ago.      I don't really play it anymore.            My stepmom

10   still plays it, and I've played Words with Friends.

11                       MR. HILL:     Ask you the same question.

12   Anything about that you think would prevent you from

13   making a decision adverse to Zynga, if you thought the

14   evidence warranted it?

15                       JUROR PRICE:      No.

16                       MR. HILL:     All right.      Thank you, sir.

17                       JUROR STRANGE:       I play Words with Friends

18   every day.

19                       [Laughter]

20                       MR. HILL:     Every day.      Well, let me ask

21   you the same question, Ms. Strange.             Anything about the

22   fact that you play Words with Friends, would that be in

23   your mind, if you thought you needed to make a decision

24   adverse to Zynga?

25                       JUROR STRANGE:       No, sir.

1                        MR. HILL:     Thank you.

2                        Let me assure those of you who play these

3    games this lawsuit does not threaten those games.

4                        Now, there's several local firms involved

5    in this lawsuit, and you saw -- you met me.                John Ward

6    is my law partner.         We're the Ward & Smith Law Firm over

7    in Longview.       But also involved are several other firms

8    that are here in Marshall.

9                        We've got Ms. Melissa Smith, who you met

10   earlier.      She's with the Gillam and Smith Law Firm.              Gil

11   Gillam is her law partner.           They have another lawyer

12   that works for them named Bobby Lamb.

13                       Does anybody know Ms. Smith, Mr. Gillam,

14   or the Gillam & Smith Law Firm?

15                       No?   And when I say that, I mean it

16   broadly.      Is there anybody that sees them at church,

17   knows them through community organizations, maybe your

18   kids go to school together, knows an employee that works

19   for them, anything like that?

20                       I'll ask the same question about me and

21   my law firm, Ward & Smith Law Firm.             Anybody familiar

22   with us?

23                       Now, there's another firm involved in

24   this case for the Defendants.            It's called Akin Gump.

25   That's the name of the firm.           They're a national firm.

1    They have offices in a number of locations, and they

2    have several of their attorneys here:              Mr. Landis,

3    Mr. Jaeger, Mr. Williams.

4                        Does anybody know of the Akin Gump Law

5    Firm or familiar with any of its attorneys?

6                        Now, I suspect Zynga has other

7    individuals that will be involved in the course of the

8    trial.     I don't know if there are any of them here in

9    the courtroom, but if you're here and you're involved on

10   behalf of Zynga, would you please stand up so we can get

11   a look at you?

12                       We know Mr. Carroll, of course, who we

13   were introduced to earlier.           We have a few folks around

14   the room.      Mr. Parrish, Todd Parrish.          And a couple

15   folks in the back.

16                       Anybody familiar with these individuals?

17   Nobody sees anybody they know?

18                       Okay.    Let me ask this:       Do any of you

19   know a fellow juror?         Look around the room.         You've seen

20   some folks around.

21                       We've got -- right back here on the

22   corner.      That's Mr. Gibbs?

23                       JUROR GIBBS:      Yes, sir.

24                       MR. HILL:     You know somebody on your

25   panel?

1                        JUROR GIBBS:      I know Frederick and

2    Ms. Blankenship.

3                        MR. HILL:     All right.      You and Mr. Stolle

4    work there at Eastman together; is that right?

5                        JUROR GIBBS:      Yes, sir.

6                        MR. HILL:     Tell me this.      I mentioned --

7    you mentioned you're an electrical supervisor; is that

8    right?

9                        JUROR GIBBS:       Yes, sir.

10                       MR. HILL:     Is that a union position or a

11   management position, or what kind of position is it?

12                       JUROR GIBBS:      It's a management position.

13   It's non-union.

14                       MR. HILL:     Okay.      Let me ask the same

15   question for you, Mr. Stolle, here on the end.                 You

16   mentioned you've been there a long time as well, 27

17   years.     Is that a management position you're in?

18                       JUROR STOLLE:      No, sir.

19                       MR. HILL:     It's not, is it?

20                       JUROR STOLLE:      No.     I'm in the training

21   department and learning services.

22                       MR. HILL:     It's a union-associated role?

23                       JUROR STOLLE:         No, it is not.

24                       MR. HILL:     Okay.      Thank you, sir.

25                       Now, y'all mentioned as well, you know --

1    you've known one other member of our jury, Mr. Gibbs.

2    That's Mr. Mahr --

3                        JUROR MAHR:      Yes, sir.

4                        MR. HILL:     -- right here, No. 10.

5    Mr. Mahr, how do you know each other?

6                        JUROR MAHR:      I know Ms. Strange through

7    previous employment with McDonald Restaurant as

8    managers.

9                        MR. HILL:     You mentioned you've been a

10   jailer in the past.         Where --

11                       JUROR MAHR:      Yes, sir.

12                       MR. HILL:     Where was that?

13                       JUROR MAHR:      Harrison County.

14                       MR. HILL:     Harrison County?

15                       JUROR MAHR:      Yes, sir.

16                       MR. HILL:     Okay.    Thank you, sir.

17                       Now, I want to talk to you a little bit,

18   folks, about PMC and its business model.               PMC develops

19   and sells technology that Mr. Harvey and his co-inventor

20   created, but it doesn't actually make a product at

21   present.      It's a technology company, not a producing

22   company.

23                       Is there anyone that's familiar with PMC

24   or other companies like PMC that are in the business of

25   selling technology, licensing technology?               Anybody
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 44 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10295
44  


1    familiar with businesses of that sort?

2                         Is there anyone who feels that if you

3    don't actually make or sell what you patent, then you

4    shouldn't be able to make other people pay for using

5    your invention?        Basically use it or lose it?

6                         And let me -- I'm going to pick on

7    somebody for that.         Let me -- Mr. Johnson over here, you

8    mentioned you're a regular participant in this, so I

9    felt like maybe I could call on you.

10                        You get a lot of jury summons, sir?

11                        JUROR JOHNSON:      Yes, sir.

12                        MR. HILL:    Thank you for answering them

13   dutifully.      Let me ask you about that.           Do you have any

14   feelings about a company who has a patent that doesn't

15   make a product ought to be able to enforce that patent

16   against other people?

17                        JUROR JOHNSON:      I believe honestly, if

18   you patent it, you need to either use it -- use it or

19   lose it.      Yes.

20                        MR. HILL:    Use it or lose it?

21                        JUROR JOHNSON:      Yes.

22                        MR. HILL:    You would start out in a case

23   like this where you have a company like PMC that doesn't

24   make a product, they patented it but don't make a

25   product that that would influence your decision about
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 45 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10296
45  


1    them being -- trying to enforce it against people who do

2    use it?

3                        JUROR JOHNSON:        Say it again.

4                        MR. HILL:     PMC doesn't make a product.

5    They have a patent.         They don't make a product.          Based

6    on your view that you ought to use it or lose it, that

7    would influence your view of whether PMC ought to be

8    here suing somebody over their patent starts you out

9    leaning against PMC likely because of that?

10                       JUROR JOHNSON:        Pretty much.

11                       MR. HILL:     Okay.     Thank you, sir.

12                       Let me ask here down the row.           Let's see.

13   Mr. Bankston, you're right there close, so we won't have

14   to move the microphone far.

15                       You agree or disagree with Mr. Johnson?

16                       JUROR BANKSTON:        I disagree.    If you look

17   at John Browning, he had patents for many weapons.                  He

18   had Winchester build them, and when they wouldn't build

19   them, then they would go -- he went across the ocean to

20   a placed called Fabrique Nationale.

21                       MR. HILL:     Uh-huh.

22                       JUROR BANKSTON:        So he did the labor, and

23   he just had someone else manufacture it for him.

24                       Is that the question?

25                       MR. HILL:     Yes, sir.
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 46 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10297
46  


1                        JUROR BANKSTON:       Okay.

2                        MR. HILL:     That's right.

3                        What about this:       What if he didn't have

4    somebody manufacture it at all?            He developed the

5    technology and he offered the technology for sale and

6    then someone used his technology without his permission,

7    should he have a right to go after them?

8                        JUROR BANKSTON:       Yeah, because if someone

9    trespasses on my land, I'm going after them.

10                       MR. HILL:     Okay.    Let me ask around the

11   room.     We'll just go down the row here.            Let's start

12   with No. 2 here, Ms. Jorgenson.

13                       Ms. Jorgenson, we've heard two points of

14   view.     Do you think you align more with what you heard,

15   use it or lose it, or would you be open to a company

16   that has a patent but doesn't make a product, enforcing

17   those property rights against someone?

18                       JUROR JORGENSON:       I believe Juror No. 7

19   that you should -- whoever uses something that you've

20   invented, they -- they need to purchase that or they

21   need to have permission for the use and not use it

22   without permission.

23                       MR. HILL:     Let's go down the row here.

24   Let's -- let's go next to you there, Mr. Senn.                Do you

25   agree or disagree with Ms. Jorgenson?
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 47 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10298
47  


1                        JUROR SENN:      I believe that I disagree.

2    If they went through the proper procedures to acquire

3    that patent, it's within their rights to use it as they

4    see fit.

5                        MR. HILL:     Now, what if they're in PMC's

6    case where we acquired the patent from the Patent

7    Office, but we don't make a product with it; we sell

8    that technology to others to use, if they wish.                 In this

9    case, we brought a lawsuit because we say somebody's

10   using it without permission.

11                       You more in the use-it-or-lose-it camp,

12   or do you think a party ought to be able to enforce that

13   property right that somebody was using?

14                       JUROR SENN:      It's their patent.       They can

15   do with it as -- as they wish.              If they choose to use

16   it, they can.       If they choose not to use it, it's their

17   patent and can tell people not to use it.

18                       MR. HILL:     Appreciate you.        Let's go

19   right next to you there, No. 4.

20                       Ms. Barrington, do you have an opinion?

21                       JUROR BARRINGTON:        Yes, sir.     I agree

22   with the gentleman.

23                       JUROR MAHR:      Why?

24                       JUROR BARRINGTON:        Why?   Why patent it

25   and, you know, use it?          If somebody else is going to use

1    it, they need to pay for it.           The service is rendered

2    basically.

3                        MR. HILL:     Thank you, ma'am.

4                        We'll go right here to Ms. Blankenship.

5                        JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        I agree.     What's the

6    patent process for?         If you have a patent, then we need

7    to abide by that.

8                        MR. HILL:     All right.     Let's go back here

9    to the back row, No. 8.

10                       Mr. Hensley, will you weigh in for us?

11                       JUROR HENSLEY:        If they own a patent,

12   then I think that they need -- if somebody's going to

13   use it, then they need to be compensated for it.

14                       MR. HILL:     Thank you, sir.        Let's go

15   right next to you there, No. 9.

16                       Mr. Adair, we've heard various opinions.

17   There's nothing wrong with that.             Everybody has a right

18   to believe and feel how they wish, because that's why we

19   do this selection process, to find out where people

20   stand.

21                       What do you think?

22                       JUROR ADAIR:      I agree with -- that if you

23   have a patent, you should be able to receive money for

24   your patent.

25                       MR. HILL:     Okay.     Let's -- let's ask next

1    to you there, Mr. Mahr?

2                        JUROR MAHR:      Yeah.     I agree with most of

3    them that if you've got a patent, you use it or lose it

4    or you just -- if you want to sell it off to somebody

5    else, it's your real prerogative.

6                        MR. HILL:     Okay.      Next to you there.      Mr.

7    Jones?

8                        JUROR JONES:      Well, you go through the

9    patent process for a reason.           If you have the patent on

10   it and somebody else uses it, it's your patent.

11                       MR. HILL:     Okay.      Next to you there.

12                       JUROR PRINCE:      Yeah.     If you -- if you

13   own the patent then -- I mean, it's yours to do with

14   what you want to.        If I own a piece of property, I can

15   do with it as I please in regards to the law.                So it's

16   the same way I feel about the patent.

17                       MR. HILL:     All right.      And we'll finish

18   out the row here.

19                       Yes, sir, Mr. Parker?

20                       JUROR PARKER:      Yes.     I believe about the

21   same.     If you own a patent and it's a viable patent,

22   then, yes, you should have the right to either sell it.

23   I mean, if you wanted to hold on to it and not even sell

24   it, it's your patent; you own it.

25                       MR. HILL:     All right.      And No. 14,

1    Mr. Pharr?

2                        JUROR PHARR:      Yes, sir.     I agree too that

3    if you own a patent, then you should either sell it or

4    don't sell it or whatever you want to do with it.

5                        MR. HILL:     Okay.

6                        JUROR PHARR:      And while I'm here, I do

7    know Zach White.        I didn't know if you seen me wave my

8    hand.

9                        MR. HILL:     Mr. White, the trooper out

10   here?

11                       JUROR PHARR:      Yes, sir.

12                       MR. HILL:     I hope you know him under good

13   circumstances.

14                       JUROR PHARR:      Yes, sir.     I know him from

15   a nephew-in-law, and I haven't seen him in about three

16   years.

17                       MR. HILL:     Okay.

18                       JUROR PHARR:      I'm glad to get to meet him

19   again.

20                       MR. HILL:     Thank you, sir.       Let me ask

21   the question.

22                       Oh, I'm sorry.        Yes, ma'am,

23   Ms. Jorgenson?

24                       JUROR JORGENSON:        I didn't want to

25   interrupt earlier.         I also grew up with Zach White's

1    wife.

2                        MR. HILL:     Okay.

3                        JUROR JORGENSON:        We went to daycare

4    together as we grew up.          I don't personally know him,

5    but I went to school with his wife.

6                        MR. HILL:     I'm glad to know you also know

7    him under good circumstances.

8                        [Laughter]

9                        MR. HILL:     Let's go here to Mr. Sanchez.

10   I'm going to stop this because I'm not going to run

11   through the whole panel.

12                       THE COURT:     You've got about four more

13   minutes, Mr. Hill.

14                       MR. HILL:     Thank you.     Thank you, Your

15   Honor.

16                       Mr. Sanchez, I tell you what, let me just

17   ask generally with the panel and I'll ask you at the

18   same time.      Is there anyone who feels if you don't use

19   it you lose it?        If you get a patent and you aren't

20   practicing that patent, but you own those rights, you

21   shouldn't be able to enforce it against others who use

22   those rights?

23                       JUROR SANCHEZ:        I personally have mixed

24   emotions about that.

25                       MR. HILL:     Yes, sir.

1                        JUROR SANCHEZ:        I feel if you've got a

2    patent that promotes progress for, let's say, the

3    greater good of humanity, it should be used.                And I also

4    feel that it needs to be bought, paid for, given

5    permission to use it by someone.             So if you've got

6    something so good and you don't use it and you sit on

7    it, it's kind of like it's not good either.

8                        MR. HILL:     Okay.     Since we do have a few

9    minutes and we're on the subject, we might as well stick

10   with it.

11                       Ms. Rockwell, let me ask your opinion.

12                       JUROR ROCKWELL:        I think if you have a

13   patent, if it's yours whether you use it or not, someone

14   should have to have permission, or do whatever the

15   process is to get somebody else's patent.                You should

16   have permission.        You shouldn't be able to trespass.

17                       MR. HILL:     Okay.     All right.    We'll --

18   Mr. Greer?

19                       JUROR GREER:      I -- I agree.      That's what

20   the patent law is all about.           If -- if you own the

21   patent on it, until it expires, then that's what it's

22   for.

23                       MR. HILL:     Okay.     And I tell you what,

24   I've asked it generally.          Does anybody else feel like

25   they're in the use-it-or-lose-it camp?

1                        No.   Okay.    I'm going to run out of time

2    here, folks, because Judge Gilstrap keeps us on a tight

3    schedule around this courthouse, which is a good thing,

4    because you won't have to hear from us for too long.

5                        He told you about the burdens of proof in

6    this case.      He talked about the preponderance of the

7    evidence standard.         That's the burden by which we have

8    to prove infringement.          That means just enough to tip

9    the scale.      To use a football analogy, pass the 50-yard

10   line.

11                       Zynga is going to claim our patent is

12   invalid, and to prove that, they have to do it by clear

13   and convincing evidence.          That means really tip the

14   scales.      Football field again, getting down into the red

15   zone maybe.

16                       Is there anybody that feels that's

17   unfair?      We have a different burden of proof to prove

18   infringement that they do to prove the invalidity of our

19   patents?

20                       That's what the law says, but you're

21   entitled to disagree with the law.             Is there anybody

22   that thinks that's unfair?

23                       The last thing I want to ask you about is

24   the damages we're going to seek in this case.                The

25   damages in this case could exceed $20 million.

1                        Is there anybody who hears that number

2    and says:      You know what, that's more money that I think

3    anybody ought to be asking for at the courthouse?

4                        Yes, ma'am?

5                        THE COURT:     You got two minutes, Counsel.

6                        MR. HILL:     Thank you, Your Honor.

7    That's No. 4; that's Ms. Barrington.

8                        JUROR BARRINGTON:       That's just a lot of

9    money.

10                       MR. HILL:     It is a lot of money.

11                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       It's just a scary

12   figure.

13                       MR. HILL:     And that's what I want to

14   know.

15                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       I mean, since we don't

16   know what their actual income is or whatever, but that's

17   a lot of money.

18                       MR. HILL:     It is and there's going to be

19   evidence on these issues, but what I want to know is,

20   who hears that number and thinks:             You know what, that

21   just sounds like -- that scares me, that amount of money

22   to be dealt with in a lawsuit?

23                       Anybody else?      Mr. Johnson, did you have

24   some comment about that?

25                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Oh, no.    That's a lot of

1    money.

2                        MR. HILL:     I agree, it is.

3                        JUROR BANKSTON:        I -- I do.    I'm sorry

4    for sitting.       That -- that's a lot of money, but in the

5    scope of things, who knows?           I mean, I'd have to have

6    all the evidence and I'd have to weigh it out myself to

7    go, no, you're -- you're -- that's -- that's wrong, or

8    150 million.

9                        MR. HILL:     Right.

10                       JUROR BANKSTON:        I don't know, but at

11   this time, I'm like, that's a chunk of change.

12                       MR. HILL:     Okay.     All right.    I

13   appreciate it.

14                       Anybody else, that just hits you and

15   makes your knee jerk when you hear that?

16                       Mr. Greer, do you fall into that camp,

17   that that number makes you uncomfortable?

18                       Anybody else, that number makes you

19   uncomfortable?

20                       Mr. Sanchez --

21                       JUROR SANCHEZ:        Yes, sir.

22                       MR. HILL:     -- you feel that way?

23                       JUROR SANCHEZ:        Yes, sir.

24                       MR. HILL:     Okay.     I appreciate that.       I

25   appreciate your candor.

1                        Anybody else before I end?

2                        Folks, we only get a limited time.            The

3    last thing I want to ask to you is, if you were me, a

4    lawyer trying to represent a client, trying to put a

5    jury together in a patent case, is there something about

6    you or your life experience that you're sitting there

7    thinking:      I'd bet he'd want to know this, because it's

8    relevant before he chooses a jury to fairly represent

9    his client?

10                       Anybody have anything of that sort in the

11   back of their mind?

12                       I appreciate your time.         I appreciate you

13   being here again.

14                       And, Your Honor, thank you for the

15   opportunity to speak to the jury.

16                       THE COURT:     All right.      Ms. Smith, you

17   may address the panel on behalf of the Defendant.

18                       MS. SMITH:     Thank you, Your Honor.

19                       THE COURT:     Would you like a warning?

20                       MS. SMITH:     I'd appreciate a five-minute

21   warning, please.

22                       THE COURT:     All right.

23                       MS. SMITH:     May it please the Court.

24                       THE COURT:     Proceed.

1                        MS. SMITH:     Good morning, again, Ladies

2    and Gentlemen.        Again, my name is Melissa Smith, and I'm

3    proud to represent Zynga in this case.              And Zynga's the

4    Defendant in this case.

5                        Some of you -- some of you are familiar

6    with Zynga.       We've already heard that some of you play

7    the Words with Friends games, and some of you, if you're

8    lucky enough to be chosen, will get to know us through

9    our games throughout the next week.

10                       First, I always want to start out in

11   joining Mr. Hill again by thanking you for your service.

12   I know that -- I know that you come, Ms. Jorgenson, from

13   Gladewater; Mr. Pharr from Big Sandy.              I know that you

14   come from pretty far places every morning, and we

15   appreciate that.

16                       I also know that every minute that we

17   spend here is a minute you spend away from your families

18   and your jobs, and I appreciate that.

19                       Now, you've been generous in sharing.

20   Some of you were able to share some information on your

21   juror questionnaires with us, and others have been

22   generous in sharing information today.              So I'll tell you

23   a little bit about myself before I begin asking you some

24   questions.

25                       I, like Judge Gilstrap, graduated from

1    Baylor Law School.         I graduated a little bit after Judge

2    Gilstrap, about 16 years ago.            Came to Marshall, Texas,

3    right on graduating from law school, and I've been

4    practicing here ever since.           I have a law firm called

5    Gillam & Smith.        It's an old yellow house that sits

6    about a block behind this courthouse.

7                        I live by Ms. Henson over in Jefferson.

8    Actually, I'm out in the county, in Marion County.                  I

9    live there with my husband, and we have two children.

10   We have a two-year-old baby boy and a six-month-old baby

11   girl.     So -- so in addition to this trial, I'm not

12   getting much sleep these days.

13                       You heard a little bit about what this

14   case is going to be about.           I'll give you a little -- a

15   little snippet and tell you that -- that way back in the

16   1980s before cell phones or smartphones as we know them,

17   before the Internet was commercially available, and

18   certainly before any -- any social media, like Facebook,

19   that PMC, the Plaintiff in this case -- case, came up

20   with an idea, and that idea, they called it personalized

21   TV.

22                       Now, fastforward to this day in this

23   courtroom and this next week.            And what you're going to

24   hear PMC say is that that idea for personalized TV,

25   those '80s kind of vintage -- vintage patents and ideas

1    they had, that they actually apply now to Zynga's

2    web-based games, web-based games like Words with Friends

3    and FarmVille that some of you know.

4                        And so what you might guess is that when

5    Mr. Hill made his introductory comments, I'm going to

6    disagree with just about -- just about everything he

7    said, but we've got a full week to talk about that with

8    those of you lucky enough to be chosen and to convince

9    you of our various positions.

10                       But I, like Mr. Hill, want to use this

11   precious little time that I have with you this morning

12   to really hear from you.          Now, knowing that we're

13   dealing with some '80s technology and that technology

14   isn't going to be as tricky, of course, as the

15   technology we have today, but we'll also be learning

16   about Zynga's technology in this case.

17                       So you see a theme developing here.            And

18   I want to -- I want to kind of understand your comfort

19   level with technology generally.             So I'm going to start

20   with Juror No. 1.

21                       And that's Mr. Newsom; is that correct?

22                       JUROR NEWSOM:      Yes, ma'am.

23                       MS. SMITH:     I want to know, Mr. Newsom,

24   do you have a computer in your home?

25                       JUROR NEWSOM:      Yes, ma'am.

1                        MS. SMITH:     Okay.    When something goes

2    wrong with that computer and it goes on the blink, are

3    you the one to fix it, or do you call someone to fix it?

4                        JUROR NEWSOM:      I call a friend.

5                        MS. SMITH:     All right.      All right.     Thank

6    you, sir.

7                        Ms. Jorgenson, same question for you.             Do

8    you use a computer in the home?

9                        JUROR JORGENSON:       Yes.

10                       MS. SMITH:     Are you the one that everyone

11   goes to when it's time to fix it?

12                       JUROR JORGENSON:       Lord, no.

13                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      Okay.    Thank you,

14   ma'am.

15                       All right.     Mr. Senn, got a computer in

16   the home?

17                       JUROR SENN:      I do, and I also send it out

18   to be repaired.

19                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      You're not the

20   one that starts tinkering with it or anything like that?

21                       JUROR SENN:      No, ma'am.

22                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      Let's -- let's

23   look at the rest of the row, and I have a question for

24   the four of you.        Do any of you think:        Well, gosh, I

25   know more than probably the average person knows about

1    computers and technology?           Any of you four have that

2    thought?

3                        All right.     I'm going -- I'm going to

4    assume then that if you-all have computers in the home,

5    are you calling someone else when it's time to fix them?

6                        Is that correct for Juror No. 4,

7    Ms. Barrington?

8                        JUROR BARRINGTON:       Yes, ma'am.

9                        MS. SMITH:     All right.      Juror No. 5,

10   Ms. Blankenship?

11                       JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        Same here.

12                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      Who do you call

13   when it's time to fix a computer?

14                       JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        We usually call my --

15   a friend of my husband's who works in IT at the

16   university.

17                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.    All right.      Fair

18   enough.      Thank you, ma'am.

19                       Mr. Johnson, we -- we talked about

20   technology going back to the '80s, as far back in the

21   '80s.     You may not fix your computer today, but could

22   you program the VCR?

23                       Remember, back in the '80s, that's what

1                        JUROR JOHNSON:       No.

2                        MS. SMITH:     No?     Okay.    Thank you, sir.

3                        What about you, Mr. Bankston?

4                        JUROR BANKSTON:        Yes, I -- I could.

5                        MS. SMITH:     All right.

6                        JUROR BANKSTON:        In the '80s.

7                        MS. SMITH:     In the '80s.

8                        JUROR BANKSTON:        Some of the stuff that

9    goes on today, I hand the remote to my kids.

10                       MS. SMITH:     Well, that was kind of a

11   trick question.        So I'm going to fastforward now from --

12   from that '80s technology that they're -- they're going

13   to talk about over at the Plaintiff's table to the

14   computer you have in your home today.

15                       Are you the one that tinkers with the

16   computer when it goes on the -- on the blitz (sic)?

17                       JUROR BANKSTON:        No, I send it off.

18                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.       Thank you, sir.

19                       JUROR BANKSTON:        Okay.

20                       MS. SMITH:     I appreciate that.

21                       Now, on the second row led by the second

22   row leader, Mr. Hensley, Mr. Hensley's row, who on that

23   row says:      You know, I know a little bit more than the

24   average person about computers?             Does anyone fit in that

25   category?

1                        I was expecting that from you.           Let's

2    see.     That's Mr. Prince.       Now, I read that you're a

3    technology director.         So I figured I'd spend some time

4    talking to you.

5                        JUROR PRINCE:      Yes.

6                        MS. SMITH:     Tell me, where do you work?

7                        JUROR PRINCE:      I work at McLeod

8    Independent School District.

9                        MS. SMITH:     Okay.      And tell me what you

10   do on a day-to-day basis.

11                       JUROR PRINCE:      I'm the technology

12   director.      I'm the guy they call to fix everything from

13   the -- from the computers.           We have --

14                       MS. SMITH:     You're the guy that

15   everybody --

16                       JUROR PRINCE:      We're getting -- we have

17   iPads for all our kids and laptops for all of our

18   upper-level kids.        So I'm the only one there, and I'm in

19   charge of about 500 computers all by myself.

20                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.

21                       JUROR PRINCE:      All the networking.

22                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      So your comfort

23   level with technology generally is -- on a 1 to 10,

24   you'd probably be a 10?

25                       JUROR PRINCE:      Yes, ma'am.

1                        MS. SMITH:     Okay.    You ever read or write

2    code?

3                        JUROR PRINCE:      Never code, no, ma'am.

4    More -- more networking-type stuff is really what I like

5    to do.     So networks and routing and VLANs and all that

6    kind of stuff.

7                        MS. SMITH:       Thank you, sir.

8                        JUROR PRINCE:      Uh-huh.

9                        MS. SMITH:     I appreciate it.

10                       The rest of you on the second row on

11   Mr. Hensley's row, do you fit in the category that when

12   something goes wrong, it's time to call someone else?

13                       You're shaking your head, Juror No. 10,

14   Mr. Mahr.      Does that describe you properly?

15                       JUROR MAHR:      No, because I'll be honest

16   with you, I don't have a computer at home.               I have no

17   interest in working with computers.              I just really

18   don't.     I apologize for that, but that's just me.              I'm

19   old-fashioned.

20                       MS. SMITH:     You have no need to

21   apologize, but I do represent a web-based game maker, so

22   I appreciate your honesty on that point, because we

23   might not always see eye-to-eye on computer things.

24                       Thank you.     Thank you.

1                        Juror -- Mr. Pharr?

2                        JUROR PHARR:      What's that?

3                        MS. SMITH:     Do you have a computer in

4    your home?

5                        JUROR PHARR:      Yes, ma'am, I do.       My wife,

6    she's on it most of the time, but if something goes

7    wrong, we usually call our kids, you know.

8                        MS. SMITH:     Thank you, sir.

9                        JUROR PHARR:      Or our grandkids.

10                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      Anyone on the --

11   what I'll call the cheap seats out here, beginning with

12   Mr. Sanchez, anyone out there that would describe

13   themselves having more knowledge than the average person

14   about computers?

15                       All right.     Juror No. 19, that's

16   Mr. Stolle?

17                       JUROR STOLLE:      Yes, ma'am.

18                       MS. SMITH:     Mr. Stolle?

19                       JUROR STOLLE:      I actually am the first

20   person to do the diagnostics in our learning department

21   before we go to the IT department.             They come to me

22   first.     And my mom and dad call me, and I do work on my

23   own computer at home.

24                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      So, Mr. Stolle,

25   you probably have the same working knowledge as

1    Mr. Prince who described his day-to-day?

2                        JUROR STOLLE:      Well, I don't have 500

3    machines to work on.         I've only got about 30, so...

4                        MS. SMITH:     Fair enough.      Thank you, sir.

5    And who did I see?         It gets more difficult for me to see

6    your numbers.       I apologize.

7                        Mr. Price, tell me about what you know

8    about computers.

9                        JUROR PRICE:      Well, I didn't mention it

10   earlier, but I work for Swift Uniforms, and I am their

11   IT tech.      I have about four desktops and like six

12   laptops and a server at my house.

13                       MS. SMITH:     That certainly qualifies as

14   more than the average person.            I agree with you.

15                       JUROR PRICE:      Yeah, that's -- yeah.

16                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.    Thank you.      Thank you

17   for that.

18                       All right.     Zynga's games are web-based

19   games, as I mentioned before, and they often are used in

20   conjunction with Facebook.           Do I have any Facebook users

21   on the first row?

22                       Ms. Jorgenson, does Racquet & Jog have a

23   Facebook page?

24                       JUROR JORGENSON:       Yes.

25                       MS. SMITH:     I thought you'd say that.

1    Are you the one that does the updates?

2                        JUROR JORGENSON:       I sometimes do that on

3    Instagram and Facebook.

4                        MS. SMITH:     Thank you.      Thanks.

5                        I have some other hands.         Mr. Newsom, are

6    you on Facebook?

7                        JUROR NEWSOM:      I have an account, but I'm

8    rarely on it.

9                        MS. SMITH:     Okay.    Thank you.

10                       Others on the first row on Facebook?

11   Everyone's on Facebook, almost, on the first row.

12   Not Juror No. 7.        Everyone but Mr. Bankston.

13                       All right.     Ms. Barrington, how often do

14   you -- do you get on Facebook?

15                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       Probably about twice a

16   month.

17                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.    And, Ms. Blankenship,

18   what do use Facebook for?

19                       JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        I keep up with my

20   kids.     I keep up with my students.          Just -- I just read

21   it.     I just check in pretty much every day and just see

22   what's going on.

23                       MS. SMITH:     I have young kids, but I have

24   a law partner with older kids, and he's actually able to

25   track his children by Facebook because they -- you know,

1    so I -- I --

2                        JUROR BLANKENSHIP:         I don't know that I

3    want to know exactly where they are.

4                        MS. SMITH:     Mine are too young to know if

5    that's going to be important.

6                        JUROR BLANKENSHIP:         All right.

7                        MS. SMITH:     Thank you.      Thanks.

8                        All right.     Juror No. 6, Mr. Johnson, are

9    you on Facebook?

10                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Yes, ma'am.

11                       MS. SMITH:     Are you a daily user?

12                       JUROR JOHNSON:       No.    Just keep up with

13   the kids and Waskom Wildcat football.

14                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      Thank you, sir.

15                       Second row, led by Mr. Hensley, anyone on

16   Facebook on the second row?

17                       All right.     Jurors 11, 12, 13, and 14.

18   Mr. Pharr, you-all use Facebook?               Regular, daily users

19   of Facebook?       Mr. Pharr, you use it -- how often do you

20   use it?

21                       JUROR PHARR:      I just go on there once in

22   a while.      I sell a product called Zeal, and I go on

23   there and check it out every once in a while.                But my

24   wife mainly does it.

25                       MS. SMITH:     What kind of product is Zeal?

1                        JUROR PHARR:      Zeal is a health product.

2    It's a vitamin and mineral that you take every day,

3    powder form.

4                        MS. SMITH:     Thank you, sir.

5                        Back to Mr. Sanchez' row and beyond, can

6    I see hands of anyone that uses Facebook?

7                        16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27.

8                        Next to Mr. -- Ms. Henson, Ms. Strange.

9    Okay.     Thank you.

10                       Cell phones, this case necessarily

11   involves cell phone technology and playing web-based

12   games on cell phones.         Cell phones have come a long way,

13   so what I'd like to kind of explore with you guys is who

14   owns -- on the first two rows, who currently has a cell

15   phone?

16                       Everybody.

17                       Okay.    Whose phone is a smartphone?

18   Everybody but Juror No. 10, Mr. Mahr?

19                       JUROR MAHR:      Yes, ma'am.

20                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      Mr. Mahr, let's

21   talk about when you got your -- when did you get your

22   cell phone?

23                       JUROR MAHR:      I think I got my first cell

24   phone about three, four years ago.

25                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      What's your cell

1    phone look like?

2                        JUROR MAHR:      It's a flip phone and it's

3    just basic buy your minutes from Verizon.

4                        MS. SMITH:     Okay.    Thank you, sir.       And

5    that was -- was that the first cell phone you ever had?

6                        JUROR MAHR:      Yes, ma'am.

7                        MS. SMITH:     All right.      Thank you, sir.

8                        On Mr. Hensley's row, that second row,

9    who has had a cell phone longer than three or four

10   years?

11                       Okay.    Jurors No. 11 through 14.

12   Mr. Pharr, when did you get your first cell phone?

13                       JUROR PHARR:      About --

14                       THE COURT:     Let's wait until the mic gets

15   there, Mr. Pharr.        Thank you.

16                       JUROR PHARR:      About five years ago.

17                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.

18                       JUROR PHARR:      I got it with work.        It

19   come with the job.

20                       MS. SMITH:     And -- and you now have a

21   smartphone?

22                       JUROR PHARR:      Yes, ma'am.      They upgraded.

23                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.    Thank you, sir.

24                       Did any of you have -- have any of you

25   had a cell phone that goes way back?              You know, we had

1    the bag phones and things.           I see some heads shaking.

2    Juror No. 4, Ms. Barrington, did you have one of those

3    phones in the bag?

4                        JUROR PHARR:      Yes, ma'am.

5                        MS. SMITH:     So you've had a cell phone

6    for a good long time?

7                        JUROR PHARR:      Yes, ma'am.

8                        MS. SMITH:     And Juror No. 11, Mr. Jones,

9    did you have that technology that goes way back from the

10   first cell phone?

11                       JUROR JONES:      Yes, we had a bag phone.

12                       MS. SMITH:     What did that look like?

13                       JUROR JONES:      Looked like a suitcase,

14   yeah, but it got really good reception.

15                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      So we've come a

16   long way in some respects but not in others.

17                       JUROR JONES:      Yes.

18                       MS. SMITH:     Is that what you're saying?

19                       JUROR JONES:      Yes.

20                       MS. SMITH:     Thank you.      Thank you, sir.

21   Anyone else have one of those bag phones?

22                       All right.     Now, Mr. -- Ms. Blankenship,

23   you are a Words with Friends player.              So I -- Mr. Hill

24   asked you questions, you know, is that -- because of

25   your love of Words with Friends, you know, would it be

1    hard to find against Zynga.

2                        I have the opposite question for you.             Is

3    there anything about your experience with Zynga or

4    Zynga's games that you need to tell me about?                Kind of

5    like the reception question, have you had any problems

6    with the games, any frustration?

7                        JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        No.   Just they don't

8    accept some of my words.

9                        [Laughter]

10                       JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        I like to make words

11   up.

12                       [Laughter]

13                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.

14                       JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        No, no.    No problems.

15                       MS. SMITH:     Got a client sitting at the

16   table, and on behalf of Zynga, I'd like to apologize for

17   that, I guess.        That's not --

18                       JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        I'm a Spanish

19   teacher, so sometimes I throw a Spanish word in.

20                       MS. SMITH:     Thank you.       And, you know, I

21   lose a lot of sleep preparing to talk to you guys, and I

22   never know what's going to come up, and I wasn't

23   prepared for that.

24                       JUROR BLANKENSHIP:        Sorry.

25                       MS. SMITH:     But thank you.       Thank you.

1    Thank you, ma'am.

2                        All right.     Mr. Prince, Mr. Parker, I'm

3    going to tiptoe around and ask you the same question.

4    Any -- any criticism of -- I know you both spend time

5    playing Zynga games.         Anything I should know about

6    because I'm here representing Zynga today?

7                        No for both of you.        Thank you.

8                        All right.     Generally on the panel, when

9    I became a parent two years ago, prior to that, my

10   husband and I would see these families out at dinner and

11   they'd have a teenager playing a game and they'd have a

12   little one watching a movie or something, and we would

13   improperly judge them and say we're never going to do

14   that; we're going to have these dinners where we all

15   talk to one another.

16                       Well, that was a ridiculous thought,

17   because if we're going to have dinner for 30 minutes and

18   enjoy it occasionally we let the little one watch --

19   play a game or something, you know, something like that.

20   So representing a game maker, I know there are people

21   that have real strong opinions on Facebook and on these

22   games.     And their wife may use them too much or their

23   kids may use them too much, and representing a game

24   maker I'd really like to know if anyone has any -- any

25   real criticism of -- of what we do at Zynga, what we

1    make at Zynga.

2                        Does anyone -- does anyone fit on that

3    camp on Row No. 1, Mr. Newsom?

4                        JUROR NEWSOM:        No.

5                        MS. SMITH:     No.

6                        Ms. Jorgenson?

7                        JUROR JORGENSON:           (Shakes head

8    negatively.)

9                        MS. SMITH:     Mr. Senn, anything you know,

10   on the first row, about what our business model is and

11   what we make possible and the games we make possible?

12                       And on the second row, I know I had a lot

13   of Facebook users so I know there won't be any criticism

14   there.

15                       Anyone starting with Mr. Sanchez, any

16   criticism about our business model, about Zynga and

17   Facebook use and things like that?

18                       Thank you.

19                       JUROR SANCHEZ:        I don't play it.

20                       MS. SMITH:     Mr. Sanchez, you don't play

21   it?

22                       JUROR SANCHEZ:        No, I don't play.

23                       MS. SMITH:     Thank you, sir.

24   Had anyone heard about this lawsuit before coming in the

25   courtroom today?

1                        Had anyone -- Mr. Hill spent some time

2    describing the Plaintiff's business model, that they

3    don't make anything, that they don't sell anything, that

4    they license technology.

5                        Has anyone -- I know some of you said in

6    your questionnaires that you got your news online.                  Has

7    anyone read anything about that type of business model

8    online or otherwise?

9                        We asked about -- or Mr. Hill asked some

10   questions about prior jury service.             I know that

11   Mr. Johnson is an expert on that, but have --

12   Mr. Johnson, have you ever done a mock jury where you

13   come in on the weekends or evenings and kind of the

14   lawyers --

15                       JUROR JOHNSON:       No, ma'am.

16                       MS. SMITH:     -- pretend to try a case?

17                       JUROR JOHNSON:       No.

18                       MS. SMITH:     That's something you probably

19   have to look forward to, since you're a target for this

20   type of litigation.

21                       Has anyone else on the panel done that

22   type of exercise?

23                       Okay.    Juror No. 12, Mr. Prince.

24                       Mr. Prince?

1    for it, but it was like one time about 10 years ago when

2    I was living in Longview, they ran an ad in the paper

3    wanting people to come do it and I went.               They paid us

4    for our time.       That's kind of what it was -- it was kind

5    of like a mock deal.

6                        MS. SMITH:     Was it a patent case?

7                        JUROR PRINCE:      No, it wasn't a patent

8    case.     Tell you the truth, I can't remember what it was

9    about.     I just remember I had to go to -- they had three

10   different juries and they rotated us all around to see

11   what kind of response they would get, I guess.

12                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.    Thank you, sir.

13                       Has anyone ever thought about filing a

14   lawsuit?      Has anyone had a -- you know, a neighbor that

15   made you so mad or someone that made you so mad, but

16   then decided not to file it for some reason?

17                       Anyone on the first row fit in that

18   group, thought about filing a lawsuit and decided not

19   to?

20                       Anyone on the second row?

21                       All right.     Ms. Strange, tell me about

22   that.     Do you think -- what were you thinking about

23   filing a lawsuit about?

24                       JUROR STRANGE:       The reason I wanted to

25   file a lawsuit is because my son, back in January, went

1    to a clinic here in town because he had an infection

2    that was that big on his leg (indicating).               The doctor

3    chose not to do anything about it, and my son almost

4    died.     So yes.

5                        MS. SMITH:     Has your son fully recovered

6    now?

7                        JUROR STRANGE:       He has staph infection

8    that does not respond to antibiotics, so it comes and

9    goes continuously.         He has to live with it for the rest

10   of his life because it got so bad.

11                       MS. SMITH:     I'm very sorry to hear about

12   that.

13                       JUROR STRANGE:       But we were not allowed

14   to do a lawsuit because they said -- the doctor said it

15   was a spider bite when indeed it was not a spider bite.

16                       MS. SMITH:     Thank you.      I appreciate you

17   sharing that.

18                       I think there was -- there was one other

19   hand.

20                       All right.     Juror No. 27, Mr. Price.

21                       JUROR PRICE:      We -- we were -- me and a

22   roommate, we used to -- we have a laser engraver that's

23   a hobby of ours.        Well, earlier this year, we had a

24   power surge at our house from a tree hitting one of the

25   lines, and we -- they weren't going to cover it saying

1    it wasn't their fault and we know it was.

2                        But we talked about carrying them to

3    court over it and suing them for it for damages, but

4    then we just decided, you know, just two people against

5    this big company, we're not going to do it, so...

6                        MS. SMITH:     All right.      Well -- well,

7    that brings up another issue, so I'm going to -- I'm

8    going to keep you standing up right now.

9                        PMC is a smaller company.          I mean, as far

10   as manpower, certainly both these entities make -- make

11   good money, but they're a smaller company, and Zynga has

12   2,000 employees.

13                       So is there anything -- not hearing any

14   other evidence, but just based on the size of the two

15   companies, is there anything that makes you kind of lean

16   towards the Plaintiff initially because it's a smaller

17   company suing a bigger company?

18                       JUROR PRICE:      No.   No.    A smaller company

19   can have the same value as a bigger company and vice

20   versa, so nothing makes me lean towards one or the

21   other.

22                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.    Thank you, Mr. Price.

23                       What about the jurors on the first row?

24   Does anyone -- Mr. Newsom, do you agree or disagree with

25   Mr. Price?

1                        JUROR NEWSOM:      I don't have any

2    discrepancies one way or the other.

3                        MS. SMITH:     Thank you, Mr. Newsom.

4                        Ms. Jorgenson?

5                        JUROR JORGENSON:       I agree with both of

6    these gentlemen.

7                        MS. SMITH:     Thank you, Ms. Jorgenson.

8                        Anyone on the first row disagree with

9    these jurors that have spoken up?

10                       What about the second row?          Am I starting

11   on the same level playing field being the larger company

12   in the courtroom today?          Does everyone agree with that?

13   Thank you.

14                       Now, what I don't think you're going to

15   hear is the Judge talking about a football field when he

16   instructs you on the law.           Didn't I -- who mentioned

17   football?      Did someone mention football?

18                       All right.     Mr. Johnson.      Now, who's your

19   team?

20                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Saints.

21                       MS. SMITH:     Saints.

22                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Professional.

23                       MS. SMITH:     Interesting choice in Texas,

24   but we'll go with that.

25                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Uh-huh.

80  


1                        MS. SMITH:     All right.      So when the

2    Saints -- this is true, is it not?              When the Saints get

3    on the 51-yard line, you don't breathe a big sigh of

4    relief, go to the snack bar, go home, because they're

5    more likely than not and they're probably not going to

6    score, do you?

7                        JUROR JOHNSON:       What yard line?

8                        MS. SMITH:     51-yard line.

9                        [Laughter]

10                       MS. SMITH:     Every time they get there.

11   That doesn't make sense, does it?

12                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Huh-uh.

13                       MS. SMITH:     Because if they were more

14   probable than not to score every time they got on the

15   51-yard line, we'd have some high-scoring games,

16   wouldn't we?

17                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Yes.

18                       MS. SMITH:     Okay.    All right.      So what

19   I'm asking you all is, if you can kind of -- if you can

20   follow the Judge's instruction about the law and the

21   burden of proof, which is a preponderance of the

22   evidence, which has absolutely nothing to do with

23   football.

24                       Can I have that agreement from everyone

25   on the first row?
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 81 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10332
81  


1                        Second row?

2                        Okay.    And in the same light, the Judge

3    is going to tell you that the Plaintiff, to prove

4    infringement, has to prove each and every element of

5    their claim.       And you heard in the patent video that's

6    not 9 out of 10, and it's certainly not, on the Saints'

7    football field, 51 percent of the claims.

8                        Is everyone in agreement that they could

9    follow the law and make Plaintiff prove each and every

10   element of their claim to prove infringement?

11                       All right.     Now let's talk about damages.

12   You know, some of you were a little bit shocked and

13   surprised about that damage number.             I know Ms.

14   Barrington is shaking her head.            And some of you are

15   pretty outspoken about that.

16                       Well, what's going to happen in this

17   case, or what I think is going to happen in this case is

18   no different than -- than even a smaller case.

19                       If there was about a five-mile-an-hour

20   fender-bender out in front of this courthouse and the

21   person jumps out of the car and says to the other

22   person:      You hit me, you wrecked my car going five miles

23   an hour, and I've got $20,000 worth of damage to my car,

24   well, if that case ultimately ends up in this courtroom,

25   that Plaintiff is going to say:            You ran into me and you

1    owe me $20,000.

2                        And not surprisingly, the Defendant is

3    going to say:       It's not my fault, and on top of that,

4    five miles an hour didn't do $20,000 in damage.

5                        Does everyone follow me?

6                        So this is a big case.         You heard it's a

7    lot of money.       But it's not going to be any different

8    because the Defendant here, Zynga, who I represent,

9    every -- we're going to rebut or we're going to defend

10   ourselves on the claims that Plaintiff brings.

11                       THE COURT:     Five minutes, Counsel.

12                       MS. SMITH:     Thank you, Your Honor.

13                       So I have a sneaking suspicion that the

14   Plaintiff is going to bring the damage expert in here.

15                       And he hinted at it, and he's going to

16   say that we owe $20 million.

17                       So is there anyone, starting with

18   Mr. Bankston on the first row, that thinks just because

19   the Defendants are coming in here and bringing a damage

20   expert and talking about damages, kind of where there's

21   smoke, there's fire, that we must have done something

22   wrong if we're going to have to talk about damages?

23                       Do you -- do you -- what are your

24   thoughts on that, Mr. Bankston?

25                       JUROR BANKSTON:        I have to be

1    100 percent -- I mean, clear on the evidence.

2                        MS. SMITH:     To be able to award

3    $20 million?

4                        JUROR BANKSTON:        To -- to come up with --

5    I'd have to be 100 percent, no questions.

6                        MS. SMITH:     Okay.

7                        JUROR BANKSTON:        That's just my -- the

8    way I am.

9                        MS. SMITH:     Okay.     But you're not going

10   to hold it against Zynga if we talk about damages but

11   still maintain a position that we just don't infringe

12   this -- this 1980s patent?

13                       JUROR BANKSTON:        No.

14                       MS. SMITH:     All right.      Thank you.

15                       Is there anyone on this first row that

16   disagrees?

17                       Anyone on the second row?

18                       Now, I, like Mr. Hill, have -- have the

19   same -- same kind of final question.              And I'll tell you,

20   I'm not always on this side of the courtroom.                Sometimes

21   I'm in your position.         And about a year ago, I was over

22   in Marion County, state court, and I was about four

23   months pregnant, and I was -- I was called for jury

24   duty.

25                       And four months, you know, didn't look

1    real pregnant, but it certainly was on my mind.                 So the

2    case I was called for dealt with an intentional injury

3    to a child, and no none -- none of those lawyers asked

4    me a single question that would cause me to tell them,

5    you know, I might not be the best juror for this one.

6    You know, I -- had that prosecutor or had the defense

7    attorney asked, I would have told them.               You know,

8    there's something personal here, and I don't want to sit

9    on a case about intentionally hurting a child.

10                       So my question to each of you is this:             I

11   can't possibly -- and we have proved this through Juror

12   No. 5, Ms. Blankenship -- I can't possibly think of

13   every question to ask you or any question you're going

14   to ask me.

15                       But is there anyone sitting there that's

16   heard about this case that knows we're going to be knee

17   deep in technology, that knows it involves a small

18   company versus a big company -- is there anybody out

19   there that says:        If Ms. Smith would just ask me this

20   one question, I would tell her that I'm just not the

21   best juror for this case?

22                       Is there anyone that has that thought?

23   Anyone that has something personal that -- that -- and I

24   don't need to know what it is, but some personal reason

25   why you wouldn't be the best juror for this case?

1                        Well, I -- I thank you for your time.

2    And I -- on behalf of Zynga and the trial team, I thank

3    you.     And I really look forward to bringing this case to

4    the eight of you that are -- that are lucky enough to be

5    chosen.      Thank you.

6                        Thank you, Your Honor.

7                        THE COURT:     Counsel, approach the bench,

8    please.

9                        (Bench conference.)

10                       THE COURT:     Does the Plaintiff have any

11   challenges for cause?

12                       MR. HILL:     Yes, Your Honor.

13                       And we request an opportunity for brief

14   individual voir dire with the jurors for the cause

15   challenge, if possible.          Juror No. 4, Juror No. 6, Juror

16   No. 7, and Juror No. 17.

17                       THE COURT:     And does Defendant have

18   challenges for cause?

19                       MS. SMITH:     No, Your Honor.

20                       THE COURT:     Okay.    4, 6, 7, and 17?

21                       MR. HILL:      Yes, Your Honor.

22                       THE COURT:     Okay.    I'm going to excuse

23   everybody except these four, and then I'll bring them up

24   one at a time here at the bench and question them.                  And

25   I'll give the -- probably let each of you ask them a

1    question if you want.

2                        MR. HILL:     Thank you.

3                        MS. SMITH:     Thank you.

4                        THE COURT:     Why don't you have a seat.

5                        I'll send everybody out but these four,

6    and then we'll be back up here.

7                        MR. HILL:     Thank you.

8                        (Bench conference concluded.)

9                        THE COURT:     Ladies and Gentlemen of the

10   Panel, I'm going to give you a brief recess, excuse you

11   for a few minutes, except there are four of you I need

12   to ask to stay behind and let me have a word with you

13   briefly.      And those are Jury Panel Members No. 4, No. 6,

14   No. 7, and No. 17.

15                       Everybody but those four, we'll excuse

16   you for a brief recess.          I'm going to ask you, as you

17   leave the courtroom through the doors at the back, to

18   stay inside the building, and I'm going to ask you to

19   make sure that you don't discuss among yourselves

20   anything that's happened while you've been in the

21   courtroom this morning.

22                       You've heard absolutely no evidence in

23   this case.      And this case must be decided solely on the

24   evidence that you hear under oath from the witness stand

25   and the exhibits that are admitted into evidence by the
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 87 of 106 PageID #:

1    Court.     None of that has happened yet.           You have heard

2    no evidence in the case.

3                        Nonetheless, don't discuss anything

4    that's happened in the courtroom while you've been here.

5    Talk about the football game; talk about the weather;

6    talk about whatever you want to talk about; but don't

7    talk about anything that's happened in the courtroom.

8                        If you will stay close, we will have you

9    back in here in a little bit and proceed with seating

10   our eight jurors that are going to make up this panel.

11                       But with those instructions, everybody

12   but those four jury panel members, you're excused in

13   recess for this -- at this time.

14                       COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

15                       THE COURT:     And No. 6 and No. 7 need to

16   stay.

17                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Where do you want us to

18   stay at?

19                       THE COURT:     So just step back out of the

20   way and let everybody else by.

21                       (Jury panel out.)

22                       THE COURT:     All right.      Be seated,

23   please.

24                       And, Ms. Barrington, would you come up

25   and see me at the bench.

1                        And, Counsel, you may approach.

2                        (Bench conference.)

3                        JUROR BARRINGTON:       Yes, sir.

4                        THE COURT:     Just got a question.         We'll

5    wait until they get here.

6                        You had indicated during the voir dire

7    that you thought $20 million was a scary figure and a

8    lot of money, but I never heard you say that you

9    couldn't award $20 million or more if the evidence

10   supported it.

11                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       If the evidence

12   supported it, yes.

13                       THE COURT:     So that's what I really

14   needed to know about.

15                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       I was a small business

16   owner, and you just think, ahh, $20 million, so...

17                       THE COURT:     Right.     But if the evidence

18   in your mind supported it, you'd have no problem?

19                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       No problem whatsoever.

20                       THE COURT:     And just the fact that that's

21   a big amount of money, that in and of itself wouldn't

22   keep you from awarding it if the evidence supported it?

23                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       If the evidence

24   supported it, yes, sir.

25                       THE COURT:     Okay.    Mr. Hill, do you have

                                   10340
89  


1    any questions?

2                        MR. HILL:     I have one question.

3                        Ms. Barrington, the fact that we're

4    asking for that amount of sum, you may see evidence

5    supporting that kind of a sum and questioning that kind

6    of a sum, does that in your mind start PMC out as

7    suspicious, someone you're suspicious of, our claims,

8    looking at us with a jaundiced eye because we are asking

9    for in excess of $20 million?

10                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       No.    If you have the

11   claims to support it and -- you know, I'm just brand new

12   to this, so I want to know why you want that much money.

13                       MR. HILL:     Okay.

14                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       I don't -- it's a --

15   I'm not going to say, oh, yeah, go ahead and take it,

16   no.

17                       MR. HILL:     Okay.

18                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       I mean, people's lives

19   are here.

20                       MR. HILL:     Uh-huh.

21                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       I mean their

22   livelihoods.

23                       THE COURT:     But you can follow my

24   instructions --

25                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       Yes, sir.

1                        THE COURT:     -- and you can apply the

2    evidence fairly?

3                        JUROR BARRINGTON:       Yes, sir.

4                        THE COURT:     And whatever the evidence

5    shows, you can award that amount?

6                        JUROR BARRINGTON:       Yes, sir.

7                        THE COURT:     If it's $20 or $200 million,

8    whatever the evidence supports, you can do that?

9                        JUROR BARRINGTON:       If the evidence is

10   there, yes, sir.

11                       THE COURT:     Okay.    Ms. Smith, do you have

12   any questions?

13                       MS. SMITH:     No questions, Your Honor.

14                       THE COURT:     Okay.    Ms. Barrington, I'm

15   going to excuse you to wait out in the hall with

16   everybody else.

17                       JUROR BARRINGTON:       All right.      Thank you.

18                       THE COURT:     Thank you, ma'am.

21                       THE COURT:     Mr. Johnson, would you step

22   up here, please.

23                       (Bench conference continued.)

24                       THE COURT:     Mr. Johnson, during the

25   questioning, you were asked about patents and if a

1    company owns patents, but they don't manufacture

2    anything; how did you feel about them enforcing those

3    patents in a court of law like this.

4                        And as I understood it, you basically

5    took the position that if a patent owner didn't use

6    their patents, then they ought to lose them, and they

7    shouldn't have the right to enforce them.

8                        Did I understand that's how you feel

9    about that?

10                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Yes, sir.

11                       THE COURT:     Okay.    That's not the law,

12   Mr. Johnson.

13                       JUROR JOHNSON:       I understand.

14                       THE COURT:     And if you're selected for

15   the jury and I instruct you that the law is that an

16   owner of their patent is entitled to seek recovery for

17   what they say is infringement, whether they manufacture

18   anything or not, can you follow that, or would you have

19   any difficulty following my instructions?

20                       JUROR JOHNSON:       I'd probably have a

21   little difficulty, but, I mean, I understand it's the

22   law.

23                       THE COURT:     All right.      But it goes

24   against --

25                       JUROR JOHNSON:       Right.

1                        THE COURT:     -- how you feel?

2                        And I gather you feel pretty strongly

3    about this?

4                        JUROR JOHNSON:        Yes.

5                        THE COURT:     Okay.     Mr. Hill, do you have

6    any questions?

7                        MR. HILL:     Mr. Johnson, I think you

8    answered the question I have.             This is a strongly held

9    belief of yours, not one that you'll be lightly

10   dissuaded from, I take it?

11                       JUROR JOHNSON:        I don't believe so.

12                       MR. HILL:     Okay.     Thank you, sir.

13                       THE COURT:     Ms. Smith?

14                       MS. SMITH:     No questions, Your Honor.

15                       THE COURT:     Okay.     Mr. Johnson, I'm going

16   to let you wait out in the hall with everybody else,

17   okay?

18                       (Juror Johnson leaves the courtroom.)

19                       THE COURT:     I'm not sure what your basis

20   for a challenge for cause with Mr. Bankston is, but --

21                       MR. HILL:     And I was mistaken about

22   Mr. Bankston, Your Honor.           I wanted to let you know.         As

23   I got back to the table, they told me I had an extra

24   number on my list that I shouldn't have.

25                       THE COURT:     So you're not challenging him

1    for cause?

2                        MR. HILL:     No, sir.

3                        THE COURT:     Okay.

4                        (Open Court.)

5                        THE COURT:     Mr. Bankston, you can join

6    the rest of the group outside.             We decided we didn't

7    need to talk to you after all.

8                        JUROR BANKSTON:        All right.

9                        (Juror Bankston leaves the courtroom.)

10                       THE COURT:     And, Mr. Greer, if you'd come

11   forward.

12                       (Bench conference continued.)

13                       THE COURT:     Mr. Greer, when you were

14   questioned this morning, you talked about the fact that

15   you'd been in a lawsuit, you'd been sued, and it cost

16   you $10,000 to get your property situation straightened

17   out.

18                       JUROR GREER:      Uh-huh.

19                       THE COURT:     I understand all of that.

20   When you were asked if that experience would cause you

21   to favor one side in this case over the other, you

22   said -- I believe you said that it could cause you to

23   favor the Defendants.

24                       Is that still the case?         Do you feel like

25   you'd have any difficulty putting that out of your mind

1    completely and hearing the evidence and basing your

2    decision solely on the evidence, or can you not put that

3    out of your mind, that experience?             Are you afraid it

4    would be there even if you tried to put it out?

5                        JUROR GREER:      It -- it would be hard

6    because that took over three years of my life, a lot of

7    depositions, cost me 10 grand.            And even the judge

8    agreed with it.        My attorney said I could probably get

9    the money back, but it would cost me half of that to do

10   it, so -- you know, so, I mean, it's been a very --

11                       THE COURT:     Is it -- is it fair to say

12   you felt like you were personally wronged in that

13   situation.

14                       JUROR GREER:      Yes.    Yeah, yeah.

15                       THE COURT:     And --

16                       JUROR GREER:      Everybody did, but it

17   didn't do me any good, and it still cost me money, you

18   know.

19                       THE COURT:     Right.     I understand.

20                       Mr. Hill, do you have any questions?

21                       MR. HILL:     Mr. Greer, would you agree

22   that that was a pretty strong personal experience that

23   would be difficult for you to set aside and eliminate

24   from your mind in considering a case like this?

25                       JUROR GREER:      Yes, sir, I'm afraid it

1    would.

2                        MR. HILL:     Thank you, sir.

3                        THE COURT:     Ms. Smith, do you have any

4    questions?

5                        MS. SMITH:     No, Your Honor.

6                        THE COURT:     Okay.    You can join everybody

7    else outside, Mr. Greer.          Thank you.

8                        (Juror Greer leaves the courtroom.)

9                        THE COURT:     Okay.    Counsel, I am not

10   going to excuse Ms. Barrington, but I am going to excuse

11   Mr. Johnson, No. 6, and I'm going to excuse Mr. Greer,

12   No. 17.

13                       That means, with only one excuse, we've

14   got 8 to seat, 4 strikes per side, through 16 and --

15   let's see.      I'm sorry.      We've excused 2, so we need to

16   strike through 18.

17                       Does everybody agree with the math?

18                       MS. SMITH:     Yes.

19                       MR. HILL:     Yes, Your Honor.

20                       THE COURT:     Okay.    How long do you need

21   to exercise your peremptory challenges?

22                       MS. SMITH:     May we have 20 minutes?

23                       THE COURT:     All right.      Have them back in

24   to Ms. Lockhart by a quarter after 11:00.

25                       MS. SMITH:     Thank you.

1                        MR. HILL:     On the jury notebooks, was the

2    extra patent -- are there three patents?

3                        THE COURT:     I don't know, but we can look

4    at that before we start the trial.

5                        MR. GOVETT:      Thank you.

6                        MR. HILL:     Thank you, Your Honor.

7                        (Bench conference concluded.)

8                        THE COURT:     All right.      We're going to

9    stand in recess until 11:15 while Counsel exercise their

10   peremptory challenges.

11                       Court stands in recess.

12                       COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

13                       (Recess.)

14                       COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

15                       (Jury panel in.)

16                       THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

17                       Ladies and Gentlemen, if you will listen

18   carefully.      As your name is called, if you'll come

19   forward and take your seat in the jury box.

20                       We are going to seat eight jurors in this

21   case, and we'll put the first four on the front row and

22   the second four on the second row.

23                       And just so that you're well positioned

24   inside the box, if the first person in would leave two

25   vacant seats at the end of each row, there will be two

1    vacant seats and then the first of the four on the front

2    row, two vacant seats and then the second four on the

3    second row.

4                        All right.     With that, Ms. Lockhart, if

5    you will call the name of the jurors that have been

6    selected.

7                        COURTROOM DEPUTY:       Okay.     Philip Newsom;

8    Kylee Jorgenson; Susan Blankenship; Billy Joe Hensley;

9    Michael Adair; William Jones; Charles Pharr; and Alex

10   Sanchez.

11                       THE COURT:     All right.       Those of you who

12   were not selected to serve on this jury, I'm about to

13   excuse you, but before I do, I want to take a moment and

14   thank each one of you personally for being here

15   participating in this process.

16                       Our system -- justice system depends upon

17   citizens such as yourselves being available and active

18   and participating in jury selections such as we've done

19   this morning.       Even though you weren't selected to

20   serve, we could not do what we do without you being

21   here.

22                       So on behalf of the Court, thank you

23   very, very much.        If you need anything for your employer

24   or any documentation that you've been here this morning,

25   Ms. Martin in the clerk's office will be glad to help

1    you.

2                        You are excused at this time.           Thank you,

3    again, Ladies and Gentlemen.

4                        COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

5                        (Jury panel out.)

6                        THE COURT:     All right.      Everyone except

7    the members of the jury may be seated, please.

8                        And, Ms. Lockhart, if you would

9    administer the oath to the jurors at this time.

10                       (Jury sworn.)

11                       THE COURT:     Have a seat, Ladies and

12   Gentlemen.

13                       We're about to excuse you for lunch in

14   just a few moments.         The evidence in this case will

15   start at 1:00 o'clock.          I'd like you to assemble in the

16   jury room about 10 minutes until 1:00 so that we can

17   start at exactly 1:00 or as close as possible.

18                       You'll get a little extra lunch hour

19   today, and you'll get a head start on the local people,

20   so that will be good.

21                       Before, though -- before I excuse you for

22   lunch, there are a few important instructions that I

23   need to give you.

24                       This case is going to be decided solely

25   upon the evidence that you hear in this courtroom and
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 99 of 106 PageID #:
                                   10350
99  


1    the exhibits that are admitted into evidence by the

2    Court.     Up until this point, you have heard absolutely

3    no evidence in this case.

4                        One of the first instructions you're

5    going to hear from me when you come back from lunch is,

6    I'll tell you that the -- what the lawyers say in this

7    case is not evidence.         And that's why I say you've heard

8    no evidence in this case so far.             You've merely heard

9    what the lawyers believe the evidence will show.

10                       Again, Ladies and Gentlemen, now that you

11   are impaneled and seated as the jury in this case, you

12   are the sole judges of the facts in this case based upon

13   the evidence that you hear during the trial.

14                       And so it's very important at the very

15   outset that you understand that you must receive your

16   information solely from the evidence that comes in under

17   oath from the witness stand and the exhibits that I

18   admit during the course of the trial.

19                       Therefore, it's absolutely critical that

20   you not receive any other outside information or

21   influences of any type.

22                       So in this regard, when I recess you for

23   lunch and you're out in the public in a few minutes and

24   particularly when you go home tonight, you are most

25   likely going to get questions about what happened down
Case 2:12-cv-00068-JRG-RSP Document 257 Filed 11/27/13 Page 100 of 106 PageID #:

                                                                             100


1    in Federal Court in Marshall today.

2                       I'm telling you right now don't answer

3    that first question, because if you answer the first

4    one, you'll answer the second one, and before you know

5    it, you will have violated my instruction to you.

6                       So don't discuss the case, anything about

7    the case with each other.          You'll only do that after all

8    the evidence is in and you have retired to deliberate

9    upon your verdict, and don't discuss the case at any

10   time with anyone else.

11                       And that means family; that means

12   friends; that means neighbors in the grocery store.

13   Don't fall into an innocent slip and violate this

14   instruction, because you must base your decisions and

15   render your verdict in this case solely upon the

16   evidence that comes during the trial.              That's absolutely

17   essential, and that's why that instruction is so

18   important.

19                       And let me just warn you now, you're

20   going to get that instruction from me every day probably

21   several times every day.           By the time this case is over,

22   you're going to be very sick of hearing me say:                 Don't

23   discuss the case among yourselves or with anyone else.

24   But it's just that important, and I want you to

25   understand that from the very beginning.

1                       Along the same lines, when I say don't

2    discuss the case, I mean don't communicate in any

3    fashion.     That means don't go home and post on Facebook

4    about what you did in court today.            Don't go on Twitter.

5    Don't do any of the social media that's out there that

6    involves e-mail, text messages.           Any form of

7    communication whatsoever about the case is prohibited,

8    and that's what my instruction goes to.              So bear that in

9    mind.

10                       Also, when you come back and we begin the

11   trial after lunch today and during each day of the

12   trial, I'm going to ask you to leave your cell phones in

13   your car.

14                       You'll have breaks, and you'll certainly

15   have a lunch hour where you can go to your car and check

16   your messages or check your e-mail, if you have a

17   smartphone, but I -- it's my instruction that you not

18   bring your cell phones into the courtroom.

19                       And I assure you, you will not hear other

20   people's cell phones in the courtroom.              If you do, they

21   will not have their cell phone very long.               So I'm going

22   to hold them to that same standard.              But if you will,

23   leave your cell phone in the car when you come back from

24   lunch and each day during the trial.

25                       Also, I want you to understand that

1    during the -- the course of this trial, the lawyers are

2    prohibited from talking with you.            And that means when

3    we have a recess or you're coming in in the morning or

4    leaving at the end of the day or you're coming in and

5    going back and forth over the lunch hour.

6                       If you pass one or more of these lawyers

7    in the hallway or on the front steps or anywhere around

8    the courthouse, if they walk right by you and don't say

9    hello or engage in conversation with you, don't hold

10   that against them; don't think they're being unfriendly;

11   don't think they're being rude.            They're doing what I

12   have instructed them to do.

13                       So bear that in mind, because they will

14   not enter into discussions with you until -- well, at

15   any time during this trial.

16                       Also, I don't think this is likely, but

17   in any and every case, it's always within the realm of

18   possibility, and that is, it is possible that some third

19   party could try to contact you or influence you with

20   regard to securing your vote a certain way in this case

21   or ruling a certain way or finding a certain fact a

22   certain way.       That's highly improper.

23                       I don't think it's -- I don't think it's

24   likely to happen, but this is an important case, and

25   there's a lot at stake for both parties, and it's always

                                    10354
                                                                             103


1    within the realm of possibility.

2                       So let me simply say, if anyone makes any

3    attempt to contact you in any manner that you feel

4    uneasy about or suspicious about, then you should advise

5    the clerk's office through Ms. Martin immediately, she

6    will contact me, and the Court will deal with it.

7                       Again, I don't think that's likely, but

8    it is within the realm of possibility.

9                       And one other thing, when I say don't

10   communicate about the case, don't discuss the case, I

11   also want to take that a step further and instruct you

12   not to attempt to do any research during the course of

13   the trial.       Don't go home and get on Google or Yahoo or

14   pull up these products or the patents.              Don't do any

15   research of any type.          That includes the old fashioned

16   kind at the local public library.             Just don't attempt to

17   research anything about the case.

18                       Because, again, it is vital that your

19   decisions be made solely and only upon the sworn

20   testimony of the witnesses from the witness stand and

21   the exhibits that the Court has carefully reviewed and

22   admitted into evidence as trial exhibits.               Those are the

23   only two sources of your information.              So don't attempt

24   to do any research.

25                       If you have not already given Ms. Martin

1    your cell phone numbers, sometime over the lunch hour

2    today, would you be sure you stop by the clerk's office

3    and make sure they have a cell phone number for you.

4    There are always possibilities that some emergency could

5    arise or something where we would need to get in touch

6    with you before you're back in court on a certain day,

7    and we just want to make sure we have a good cell phone

8    number for each member of the jury.             If you'd do that,

9    we would appreciate it.

10                       With those instructions, Ladies and

11   Gentlemen, I'm going to excuse you for lunch.                And,

12   again, please be back assembled in the jury room before

13   1:00 o'clock, and we'll attempt to start as close to

14   1:00 o'clock as we can.          Don't discuss the case among

15   yourselves or with anyone else.

16                       With those instructions, you're excused

17   for lunch at this time.

18                       COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise for the

19   jury.

20                       (Jury out.)

21                       THE COURT:      Be seated, please.

22                       Counsel, we're going to recess for lunch

23   as well.      I would simply like to have counsel back in

24   the courtroom by about 12:45.            There have been some

25   joint motions filed overnight and some narrowing of the

1    case.

2                       I want to get those things on the record

3    before we start, and I want to have an opportunity to

4    make sure there are not any other developments before we

5    bring the jury back in at 1:00 o'clock.

6                       So with that, you're excused for lunch,

7    and I'll see you at 12:45.

8                       COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise.

9                       THE COURT:      Court stands in recess.

10                       (Lunch recess.)
