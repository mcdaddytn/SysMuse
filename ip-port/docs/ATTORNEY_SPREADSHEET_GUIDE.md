## Directory Convention

**IMPORTANT**: Data files and macro files are stored in separate directories:

| Directory | Contents | Tracked in Git |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| `output/` | Data files (CSV, JSON) | No (gitignored) |
| `excel/` | VBA macro files (.bas) only | Yes |

**Rationale**: Data files are generated outputs and should not be committed to source control. Macro files are code and should be versioned.

To regenerate data files:
```bash
npm run export:attorney     # Full portfolio
npm run top500:v3          # Top 500 (V3)
npm run top500:recalc      # Top 500 (V2)
npm run export:withinsector # Within-sector
```

## Top 500 Spreadsheet (TOP500-*.csv)

The Top 500 represents the highest-priority patents based on a consensus score across multiple stakeholder perspectives.

### Stakeholder Profiles

Six different weighting profiles are used, representing different strategic approaches:

| Profile | Focus | Emphasizes |
|---------|-------|------------|
| IP Litigator (Aggressive) | Win big cases | Enforcement, high citations |
| IP Litigator (Balanced) | Standard litigation | All factors equally |
| IP Litigator (Conservative) | Low risk | Validity, strong prosecution |
| Licensing Specialist | Portfolio value | Market relevance, breadth |
| Corporate/M&A | Strategic deals | Business alignment |
| Executive/Portfolio | Balanced view | All factors |

The **Consensus Score** is the average across all profiles.

### Reading the Top 500

- **Higher rank = More valuable** under consensus view
- Patents at top are strong across multiple perspectives
- Review `competitors_citing` to identify licensing/litigation targets
- Check `sector` to understand technology groupings

## V2 Top 500 Spreadsheet (unified-top500-v2-*.csv)

The V2 model uses a simpler, citation-weighted scoring approach that emphasizes competitor interest over legal quality metrics.

### V2 Scoring Formula

```
Score = (competitor_citations / max_citations) × year_multiplier × 100
```

Where `year_multiplier` rewards patents with more remaining term.

### Key Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| rank | Position in V2 rankings (1-500) |
| patent_id | USPTO patent number |
| **affiliate** | **Normalized portfolio entity** |
| title | Patent title |
| score_unified | V2 combined score (0-100) |
| competitor_citations | Citations from competitors |
| years_remaining | Years until expiration |
| year_multiplier | Term bonus factor |
| competitors | List of citing competitors |
| sector | Technology sector |
| score_aggressive | Score under aggressive profile |
| score_moderate | Score under moderate profile |
| score_conservative | Score under conservative profile |

### When to Use V2 vs V3

| Use V2 When | Use V3 When |
|-------------|-------------|
| Finding patents competitors are actively using | Evaluating litigation risk/reward |
| Identifying licensing opportunities | Prioritizing patents with strong legal posture |
| Volume-based analysis | Quality-focused analysis |

## Partner Engagement Strategy

This section outlines our approach to engaging external partners (law firms, technical experts, licensing specialists) in the patent analysis process.

### Overview: Collaborative Analysis Loop

Our analysis system is designed to incorporate partner feedback to continuously improve ranking accuracy and product relevance. The workflow creates a feedback loop:

```
Internal Analysis → Partner Review → Feedback Integration → Improved Analysis
        ↑                                                           │
        └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 1: Patent/Product Heat Maps

**Objective**: Generate visual mappings of patent coverage across competitor products and market segments.

**What We Provide to Partners**:
1. **Sector-specific patent sets** (from WITHIN-SECTOR exports)
2. **Competitor citation data** showing which companies cite our patents
3. **Technology categorization** (CPC codes, sector assignments)
4. **LLM-generated product type suggestions** (from `product_types` field)

**What Partners Provide**:
1. **Product identification**: Specific products/services that may practice the technology
2. **Feature mapping**: Which product features relate to which patent claims
3. **Market intelligence**: Revenue estimates, market share, product roadmaps
4. **Infringement likelihood**: Initial assessment of evidence accessibility

**Heat Map Dimensions**:
| Row | Column | Cell Value |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Patent or Patent Group | Competitor Product | Coverage strength (1-5) |

**Deliverable**: Excel/visualization showing patent coverage density across product landscape.

### Phase 2: Claim Chart Construction

**Objective**: Develop detailed claim charts mapping patent claims to specific product implementations.

**Selection Process** (from current analysis):

1. **Start with Top 500** patents
2. **Filter by target criteria**:
   - `competitor_citations` >= 5 (proven interest)
   - `enforcement_clarity` >= 4 (detectability)
   - `years_remaining` >= 5 (remaining value)
3. **Select sector focus** based on business priorities
4. **Choose 10-20 patents** for initial claim chart development

**Partner Deliverables Requested**:
1. **Element-by-element claim mapping** to product implementation
2. **Evidence documentation** (user manuals, teardowns, whitepapers, standards docs)
3. **Claim interpretation notes** (construction issues, narrowing amendments)
4. **Infringement opinion** (preliminary assessment)

**Claim Chart Template Structure**:
| Claim Element | Product Feature | Evidence Source | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| [Claim 1 preamble] | [Feature X] | [URL/Doc ref] | [Construction notes] |
| [Element A] | [Component Y] | [Teardown photo] | [Optional narrowing] |

### Phase 3: Feedback Integration

**How Partner Feedback Improves Our System**:

| Partner Input | System Improvement |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Product identifications | Updates `likely_implementers` field |
| Feature mappings | Improves `technology_category` assignments |
| Evidence accessibility notes | Refines `evidence_accessibility_score` |
| Claim chart quality assessment | Validates `enforcement_clarity` scoring |
| Market intelligence | Enhances `market_relevance_score` |
| Infringement opinions | Calibrates overall ranking weights |

**Feedback Capture Process**:

1. **Structured feedback forms**: Partners complete standardized assessments
2. **Discrepancy tracking**: Where partner assessment differs from LLM scores
3. **Score calibration**: Adjust LLM prompts/weights based on patterns
4. **Product database growth**: Build knowledge base of product/patent mappings

### Phase 4: Enhanced Analysis Output

**Partner feedback enables**:

1. **Better sector assignments**: Real-world product alignment
2. **More accurate implementer lists**: Validated company/product targeting
3. **Improved detection methods**: Evidence strategies that work in practice
4. **Refined market relevance**: Actual revenue exposure estimates
5. **Claim chart templates**: Pre-built mappings for common technologies

### Engagement Timeline (Suggested)

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Initial briefing** | Week 1 | Portfolio overview, priority sectors |
| **Heat map development** | Weeks 2-4 | Product coverage maps for 2-3 sectors |
| **Claim chart pilot** | Weeks 5-8 | 10-20 claim charts for top patents |
| **Feedback review** | Week 9 | Assessment of LLM accuracy, calibration |
| **System update** | Week 10 | Refined rankings with partner intelligence |

### Data Sharing Guidelines

**What We Share**:
- Patent metadata (public USPTO data)
- Competitor citation statistics (derived from public data)
- LLM-generated summaries (our analysis)
- Scoring metrics (our proprietary weights)

**What Partners Should NOT Share Externally**:
- Complete portfolio rankings
- Scoring weights and formulas
- Strategic prioritization decisions
- Claim chart work product (privileged)

### Success Metrics

**Engagement Success = Improved Analysis Quality**:

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Product identification accuracy | 60% | 85% |
| Enforcement clarity calibration | ±1.0 | ±0.5 |
| Claim chart development time | New | -30% with templates |
| False positive rate (bad patents) | Unknown | <10% in Top 50 |

### Partner Communication Templates
