09:45:17    1   colleague Mr. Fabricant and the attorneys with his firm --

09:45:20    2   you know, over the years I have had many opportunities to

09:45:23    3   work with them.    And I hope that you found exactly what

09:45:26    4   I've found over the years is that they come in, they --

09:45:30    5   they present you with a case, they do a good job of it, and

09:45:33    6   we -- we appreciate that, as well.

09:45:35    7            I want to begin by talking with you a little bit

09:45:38    8   about some of the things that we talked about last week,

09:45:41    9   when I had an opportunity to visit with you during voir

09:45:44   10   dire.   And one of the first things I want to talk about is

09:45:48   11   these Scales of Justice.

09:45:49   12            And His Honor just took an hour going through the

09:45:54   13   charge, that you're going to get to take back with you.

09:45:57   14   And you heard him talk about the burdens of proof.
