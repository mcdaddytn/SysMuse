09:09:39    8   Q.   And what Google said in this document is, whatever you

09:09:42    9   tell us that you're going to sell it to us for, we consider

09:09:46   10   that binding, correct?

09:09:47   11   A.   Yes.

09:09:52   12               MR. DACUS:   That's all the questions I have,

09:09:55   13   Your Honor.     I pass the witness.

09:09:56   14               THE COURT:   Further cross-examination?

09:09:58   15               MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:   Yes, Your Honor.

09:09:58   16               THE COURT:   Please proceed.

09:09:58   17                            RECROSS-EXAMINATION

09:10:18   18   BY MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:

09:10:18   19   Q.   Mr. McGavock, you haven't seen a signed or approved

09:10:21   20   agreement for Mr. Li -- Dr. Li to sell his patent to

09:10:25   21   Google, have you?

09:10:25   22   A.   No.

09:10:26   23   Q.   You haven't brought a document here today that

09:10:28   24   indicates that the form that Mr. Dacus just showed you was

09:10:32   25   ever executed by Dr. Li?

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 338 Filed 10/09/20 Page 37 of 82 PageID #: 19597
                                                                                   1195



09:10:35    1   A.    It's my understanding that he accepted the terms

09:10:41    2   through the website.

09:10:43    3   Q.    Did you show a document to the jury that shows that he

09:10:48    4   accepted any specific terms of an agreement with Google?

09:10:53    5   A.    Not outside of what I just discussed.

09:10:56    6   Q.    So what you just discussed was a form which was not

09:10:58    7   completed, correct?

09:11:00    8   A.    Correct.

09:11:01    9   Q.    Mr. Dacus showed you a form which had blank entries in

09:11:05   10   every single box, right?

09:11:07   11   A.    Correct.

09:11:10   12   Q.    And you have no proof that Dr. Li ever executed the

09:11:15   13   specific form that Mr. Dacus put in front of you?

09:11:18   14   A.    I disagree.   That -- that was the form that Google

09:11:21   15   used, and I have the accepted order -- Google form that I

09:11:27   16   was shown.

09:11:28   17   Q.    Did Google present any evidence at trial as to the form

09:11:31   18   that it used at the particular time that Dr. Li executed

09:11:34   19   it?

09:11:36   20   A.    It was public -- all publicly available.

09:11:40   21             MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:    Move to strike that as not

09:11:43   22   responsive, Your Honor.

09:11:44   23             THE COURT:   Sustained.

09:11:44   24             The question was:    Did Google present any

09:11:49   25   evidence?

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 338 Filed 10/09/20 Page 38 of 82 PageID #: 19598
                                                                                   1196



09:11:52    1   A.   Specific to Dr. Li?

09:11:54    2   Q.   (By Mr. Lambrianakos)    Yes.

09:11:55    3   A.   I -- I believe there was correspondence, yes.

09:12:02    4   Q.   That correspondence was presented to the jury to

09:12:04    5   review; is that your testimony?

09:12:05    6   A.   I believe there was a rejection of the offer.

 
09:13:48   12   A.   It could be relevant, but in this case, I don't think

09:13:51   13   it's relevant for adjusting the value.

09:13:55   14            MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:     No further questions.

09:13:55   15            THE COURT:    You pass the witness, counsel?

09:13:58   16            MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:     Yes, Your Honor.      Apologies.

09:14:00   17            THE COURT:    Is there additional direct, Mr. Dacus?

09:14:03   18            MR. DACUS:    Just one question, Your Honor.

09:14:07   19            THE COURT:    I can count to one.

09:14:09   20            MR. DACUS:    Yes, sir.    I know you can.

09:14:11   21            May I have the ELMO, Ms. Lockhart?

09:14:11   22                         REDIRECT EXAMINATION

09:14:15   23   BY MR. DACUS:

09:14:15   24   Q.   I'm showing you, sir, what has been marked as DTX-41 in

09:14:19   25   the case.   Is that the rejection letter from Google that

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 338 Filed 10/09/20 Page 40 of 82 PageID #: 19600
                                                                                   1198



09:14:22    1   you were just referencing with Mr. Lambrianakos?

09:14:24    2   A.   Yes.

09:14:27    3               MR. DACUS:   That's all I have, Your Honor.       I pass

09:14:29    4   the witness.     Thank you.

09:14:30    5               THE COURT:   Further cross-examination?

09:14:31    6               MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:   Nothing further.

09:14:33    7               THE COURT:   You may step -- step down,

09:14:35    8   Mr. McGavock.

09:14:40    9               Mr. Dacus, does Defendant wish this witness to be

09:14:42   10   excused?

09:14:43   11               MR. DACUS:   If he -- if he can please be excused,

09:14:49   12   Your Honor.

09:14:49   13               THE COURT:   Is there any objection from the

09:14:50   14   Plaintiff?

09:14:51   15               MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:   No, Your Honor.

09:14:51   16               THE COURT:   The witness is excused.
