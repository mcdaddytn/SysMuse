# Feature 05 Implementation Status

## Current State
Feature 05 (Enhanced Search Output with Templates) has been implemented but is experiencing issues with query execution and results retrieval.

## What Was Successfully Completed

### 1. Core Feature Implementation
- ✅ Created `EnhancedSearchService` in `src/services/EnhancedSearchService.ts`
- ✅ Implemented hierarchical JSON output structure (Trial → Session → Statements → Speaker)
- ✅ Added template system with multiple templates in `config/templates/`:
  - `default.txt` - Basic statement format
  - `courtroom-dialogue.txt` - Shows line numbers and speaker context
  - `witness-testimony.txt` - Formatted for witness Q&A
  - `judge-statements.txt` - Formatted for judicial rulings
- ✅ Implemented `surroundingStatements` feature to include context before/after matched statements
- ✅ Added deduplication logic to prevent duplicate statements in output
- ✅ Created test scripts in `src/scripts/`:
  - `runEnhancedQueries.ts` - Runs all enhanced query configurations
  - `runEnhancedTests.ts` - Additional test runner

### 2. Trial Name Parsing Fix
- ✅ Fixed `TranscriptParser.ts` to correctly extract full trial name from )( format
- ✅ Trial name now correctly parsed as: "VOCALIFE LLC, PLAINTIFF, VS. AMAZON.COM, INC. and AMAZON.COM LLC, DEFENDANTS."
- ✅ Previously was incorrectly parsing as "7 VS. MARSHALL, TEXAS" or "VOCALIFE LLC, PLAINTIFF, VS."

### 3. Data Import and Sync
- ✅ Successfully imported 23,042 statement events
- ✅ Synced all statements to Elasticsearch
- ✅ Database contains proper speaker types: JUDGE (1), ATTORNEY (20), WITNESS (17), JUROR (38), ANONYMOUS (6)
- ✅ Verified 1,606 judge statements and 350 statements containing "objection"

## Known Problems

### 1. Query Execution Issues
- **Problem**: Most enhanced queries return 0 results despite data being present
- **Symptoms**: 
  - SQL queries return 0 statements for most filters
  - Only "query-enhanced-objections" finds statements (11,700) but hits Elasticsearch limit
- **Likely Cause**: Issue with how filters are being applied or how the trial name is being matched

### 2. Elasticsearch Result Window Error
- **Problem**: "Result window is too large, from + size must be less than or equal to: [10000] but was [11700]"
- **Occurs**: When querying for objections (attorney statements)
- **Need**: Implement pagination or scrolling for large result sets

### 3. Line Number Issues (Partially Fixed)
- **Previous Issue**: Line numbers were session-relative instead of trial-wide
- **Quick Fix Applied**: `quickFixLineNumbers.ts` assigned sequential numbers
- **Proper Fix Needed**: Parse line numbers from page headers (line 2 of each page)

### 4. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- Multiple compilation errors exist in various files
- Need to resolve before building project

## Test Results Summary

### Working:
- Database populated with correct data
- Elasticsearch sync completed
- Trial name parsing fixed

### Not Working:
- Enhanced query filters not matching data correctly
- Text output generation (0 files generated)
- Surrounding statements feature (can't test without matches)

## Configuration Files Status

### Enhanced Query Configurations (`config/enhanced-queries/`):
All 8 configuration files created and structured correctly:
- `query-enhanced-all-objections.json`
- `query-enhanced-attorney-hadden.json`
- `query-enhanced-court-directives.json`
- `query-enhanced-dialogue.json`
- `query-enhanced-judge.json`
- `query-enhanced-objections.json`
- `query-enhanced-witness-ratliff.json`
- `query-enhanced-witness.json`

## Next Steps Needed

1. **Debug Query Filtering**:
   - Investigate why SQL queries return 0 results
   - Check if trial name matching is working correctly
   - Verify speaker type and prefix filtering logic

2. **Fix Elasticsearch Pagination**:
   - Implement scroll API or pagination for large result sets
   - Update EnhancedSearchService to handle > 10,000 results

3. **Resolve TypeScript Errors**:
   - Fix compilation errors to allow proper builds
   - Update type definitions where needed

4. **Complete Testing**:
   - Once queries work, verify surrounding statements feature
   - Test all templates generate correct output
   - Verify deduplication works as expected

5. **Line Number Parsing**:
   - Implement proper trial-wide line number parsing from page headers
   - Remove quick fix and use correct parsing logic

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `/src/services/EnhancedSearchService.ts`
- `/src/scripts/runEnhancedQueries.ts`
- `/src/scripts/runEnhancedTests.ts`
- `/src/scripts/quickFixLineNumbers.ts`
- `/config/templates/*.txt` (4 template files)
- `/config/enhanced-queries/*.json` (8 query configurations)

### Modified Files:
- `/src/parsers/TranscriptParser.ts` (fixed trial name parsing)
- `/docs/features/feature-05.md` (updated with implementation notes)

## Session End Notes

The core feature is implemented but needs debugging to resolve the query filtering issues. The data is present and correctly structured, but the enhanced search queries are not finding matches. This appears to be a logic issue in how the filters are applied rather than a data problem.

The user expressed frustration with regression issues (particularly the trial name parsing that was previously fixed) and wants to review the code against older versions before continuing.
