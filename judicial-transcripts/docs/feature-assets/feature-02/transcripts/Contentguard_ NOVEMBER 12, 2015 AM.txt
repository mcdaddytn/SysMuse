3                    COURT SECURITY OFFICER:           All rise.

4                    THE COURT:      Be seated, please.

5                    All right.      Mr. Baxter, you're going to do the

6       opening for the Plaintiff; is that correct?

7                    MR. BAXTER:      I am, Your Honor.

8                    THE COURT:      And who's going to -- who's going to

9       present the opening for the Defendant?

10                   MR. PRITIKIN:        I'll be doing that, Your Honor.

11                   THE COURT:      Okay.    Good.     Any questions before we

12      bring the jury in?

13                   MR. BAXTER:      Not from the Plaintiff, Your Honor.

14                   MR. PRITIKIN:       And not from Apple, Your Honor.

15                   THE COURT:      All right.       Let's bring in the jury,

16      please.

17                   (Jury in.)

18                   THE COURT:      Please be seated.

19                   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

20      Welcome back.

21                   I want to thank you for being on time.               We're

22      going to try to keep the case running on the time that I

23      mentioned and the schedule that I mentioned to you during

24      jury selection, but I now have some preliminary instructions

25      that I want to give you before we start with opening

1       statements from the lawyers and then get on to the evidence.

2                    You've now been sworn as the jurors in this case,

3       and as the jury, you are the sole judges of the facts.                   As

4       such, you will decide and determine all of the facts in this

5       case.

6                    As the Judge, I'll give you instructions on the

7       law.     I'll decide questions of law that arise during the

8       trial and handle matters related to evidence and procedure.

9       I'm also responsible for managing the flow of the trial

10      process and maintaining the decorum of the courtroom.

11                   Now, at the end of the evidence, I'll give you

12      detailed instructions about the law to apply in deciding

13      this case, and I'll give you a list of questions that you

14      are then to answer.

15                   This list of questions is called the verdict form.

16       Your answers to those questions will need to be unanimous,

17      and those answers to those questions will constitute the

18      verdict in this case.

19                   I now want to briefly tell you what this case is

20      about.     This case involves a dispute regarding certain

21      United States patents.

22                   Now, I know that you've previously seen the patent

23      film, but I want to give you some instructions here and on

24      the record about how a patent -- about what a patent is and

25      how it's obtained.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 5 of 127 PageID #: 69173 5



1                    Patents are granted or denied by the United States

2       Patent and Trademark Office, an agency of the United States

3       Government.      The patent -- United States Patent and

4       Trademark Office will often be referred to in this trial

5       simply and for shorthand as the PTO.

6                    A valid United States patent gives the

7       patentholder the right for up to 20 years from the date the

8       patent application is filed to prevent others from making,

9       using, offering to sell, or selling the patented invention

10      within the United States or from importing it into the

11      United States without the patentholder's permission.

12                   A patent is a form of property.            It's called

13      intellectual property, sometimes short -- shortened to IP.

14      Like other forms of property, a patent can be bought or

15      sold.

16                   A violation of a patentholder's rights is called

17      infringement.      The patentholder may try to enforce a patent

18      against persons it believes to be infringers by filing a

19      lawsuit in federal court, which is what we have in this

20      case.

21                   The process of obtaining a patent is called patent

22      prosecution.      To obtain a patent, one must first file an

23      application with the United States Patent and Trademark

24      Office or the PTO.        As I said, the PTO is an agency of the

25      federal government that employs trained examiners to review
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 6 of 127 PageID #: 69174 6



1       patents and review applications for patents.

2                    The application that's filed includes what's

3       called a specification.          The specification contains a

4       written description of the claimed invention telling what

5       the invention is, how it works, how to make it, and how to

6       use it.

7                    The specification concludes or ends with one or

8       more numbered sentences.          These numbered sentences are

9       called the patent claims.          When a patent is granted by the

10      PTO, the claims define the boundaries of its protection and

11      give notice to the public of those boundaries.

12                   Patent claims may exist in two forms referred to

13      as independent claims and dependent claims.

14                   An independent claim does not refer to any other

15      claim in the patent.         It's independent.        It's not necessary

16      to look at any other claim to determine what an independent

17      claim covers.      However, a dependent claim refers to at least

18      one other claim in the patent.

19                   A dependent claim includes each of the limitations

20      of that other claim or claims to which it refers, as well as

21      the additional limitations recited within the dependent

22      claim itself.

23                   Therefore, to determine what a dependent claim

24      covers, it's necessary to look at both the dependent claim

25      itself and the independent claim or claims from which it
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 7 of 127 PageID #: 69175 7



1       refers, or as we sometimes say, from which it depends.

2                    The claims of the patents-in-suit use the word

3       "comprises" or "comprising."           "Comprising" means including

4       or containing.       A claim that includes the word "comprising"

5       or "comprises" is not limited to the methods or devices

6       having only the elements that are recited in the claim but

7       also covers methods or devices that add additional elements.

8                    Let me give you an example.           A claim that covers a

9       table may recite that it's comprised of a tabletop, legs,

10      and glue.     That claim will cover any table that contains

11      those structures, even if the table also contains other

12      structures, such as a leaf or has wheels to go on the ends

13      of the legs.

14                   Now, that's a very simple example using the word

15      "comprising" and what it means.            In other words, it can have

16      other features in addition to those that are covered by the

17      patent claim.

18                   After the applicant files an application with the

19      PTO, an Examiner reviews the application to determine

20      whether or not the claims are patentable, that is to say,

21      appropriate for patent protection, and whether or not the

22      specification adequately describes the invention claimed.

23                   In examining a patent application, the Examiner

24      reviews certain information about the state of the

25      technology at the time the application was filed.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 8 of 127 PageID #: 69176 8



1                    The PTO searches for and reviews this type of

2       information that is publicly available or that was submitted

3       by the applicant.        This type of information is called prior

4       art.

5                    The Examiner reviews this prior art to determine

6       whether or not the invention is truly an advance over the

7       state of the art at the time.           Prior art is defined by law,

8       and I'll give you, at a later time, specific instructions as

9       to what constitutes prior art.

10                   However, in general, prior art includes

11      information that demonstrates the state of the technology

12      that existed before the claimed invention was made or before

13      the application for a patent was filed.

14                   A patent contains a list of certain prior art that

15      the Examiner has considered.           The items on this list are

16      called the cited references.

17                   After the prior art is searched and examined from

18      the application, the Examiner informs the applicant in

19      writing of what the Examiner has found and whether the

20      Examiner considers the claim to be patentable and thus to be

21      allowed.

22                   This writing from the Examiner is called an office

23      action.     If the Examiner rejects the claims, the applicant

24      has an opportunity to respond to the Examiner to try to

25      persuade the Examiner to allow the claims.                The applicant
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 9 of 127 PageID #: 69177 9



1       also has a chance to change or amend the claims or to submit

2       new claims.

3                    And this process may go back and forth between the

4       applicant and the Examiner for some time until the Examiner

5       is satisfied that the application meets the requirements for

6       a patent.     And in that case, the application issues as a

7       United States patent.

8                    Or in the alternative, if the Examiner ultimately

9       concludes the application should be rejected, then in that

10      case, no patent is issued.

11                   Sometimes patents are issued after appeals within

12      the Patent and Trademark Office or to a court.                 The papers

13      generated during these communications back and forth between

14      the Examiner and the applicant are called the prosecution

15      history.

16                   The fact that the PTO grants a patent does not

17      necessarily mean that any invention claimed in the patent,

18      in fact, deserves the protection of a patent.                 While an

19      issued patent is presumed to be valid under the law, a

20      person accused of infringement has the right to argue here

21      in federal court that the claimed invention in a patent is

22      invalid.

23                   It's your job as the jury to -- to consider the

24      evidence presented by the parties and determine

25      independently and for yourselves whether or not the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 10 of 127 PageID #: 6917810



1      Defendant has proven that any patent at issue in this suit

2      is invalid.

3                    To help you follow the evidence, I'll now give you

4      a brief summary of the positions of the parties.

5                    The party who brings the lawsuit, as you probably

6      know, is called the Plaintiff.             The Plaintiff in this case

7      is ContentGuard Holdings, Inc., who will often be simply

8      referred to for short as ContentGuard or simply the

9      Plaintiff.

10                    The party against whom this suit is brought, as

11      you probably know, is called the Defendant.                 In this case,

12      the Defendant is Apple, Inc., who will often be referred to

13      simply as Apple or the Defendant.

14                    As I told you during jury selection, which we call

15      voir dire, on Monday, this case is about alleged patent

16      infringement.       In this case, there are five separate

17      patents-in-suit.

18                    The first patent at issue in this case is United

19      States Patent 6,963,859.           Now, patents are commonly known by

20      their last three digits, so this patent will simply be

21      referred throughout the case as the '859 patent.

22                    The second patent at issue in this case is United

23      States Patent No. 8,370,956, which, likewise, will simply be

24      referred to as the '956 or '956 patent.

25                    The third patent is United States Patent
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 11 of 127 PageID #: 6917911



1      No. 8,393,007, which will be referred to as the '007

2      patent -- or I'm sorry.          Someone will call it the double 07

3      patent.

4                    The fourth patent at issue is United States Patent

5      No. 7,523,072, which will be simply called the '072 patent.

6                    And the fifth and last patent at issue in this

7      case is United States Patent No. 8,001,5 -- excuse me --

8      8,001,053, which will be called the '053 or '053 patent.

9                    These patents may be referred to at various times

10      throughout the trial as the patents-in-suit or the asserted

11      patents, and these patents generally relate to protecting

12      content on electronic devices, such as smartphones and

13      tablets.

14                    Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will each have a

15      complete copy of all five of these patents-in-suit in your

16      juror notebooks which you'll receive in a moment.

17                    The Plaintiff in this case, ContentGuard, contends

18      that the Defendant, Apple, is directly and indirectly

19      infringing certain claims of the patents-in-suit by

20      importing, making, and selling products that include or

21      perform the patented technology.

22                    ContentGuard also contains -- contends, rather,

23      that Apple's infringement is willful and that ContentGuard

24      is entitled to money damages as a result of Apple's

25      infringement.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 12 of 127 PageID #: 6918012



1                    Apple denies that it is infringing the

2      patents-in-suit and contends that the patents-in-suit are

3      invalid, as either being anticipate -- anticipated by what

4      is called prior art or as being obvious in the light of such

5      prior art.

6                    I'll give you more detailed instructions regarding

7      the meaning of these terms in a few moments.

8                    Now, ladies and gentlemen, I know that there are a

9      lot of new words and new concepts that have been thrown at

10      you, and I'm going to define a lot of those words and

11      concept -- concepts for you as we go through these

12      instructions.

13                    The attorneys are also going to discuss them in

14      their opening statements.           The witnesses are going to help

15      you, through their testimony, understand these words.

16                    So don't feel overwhelmed at this stage.               It will

17      all come together as we go through the trial, I promise you.

18                    Your job in this case is to decide whether the

19      asserted claims have been infringed and whether the asserted

20      claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid.                 If you decide

21      that any claim of the patents-in-suit has been infringed and

22      is not invalid, then you will need to decide what amount of

23      money damages are to be awarded to the Plaintiff,

24      ContentGuard, as compensation for such infringement.

25                    Now, as I said, my job in the case as the Judge is
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 13 of 127 PageID #: 6918113



1      to tell you what the law is, to handle rulings on evidence

2      and procedure, and to oversee the conduct of the trial.

3                    In determining the law, it is specifically my job

4      to determine the meaning of any claim language from within

5      the asserted patents that needs interpretation.

6                    I've already determined the meaning of certain

7      claim terms in the patents-in-suit, and you must accept

8      those meanings that I give you and use those meanings when

9      you decide whether any particular claim has or has not been

10      infringed and whether or not any claim is invalid.                   You'll

11      be given a document in a moment that reflects those

12      constructions and meanings.

13                    For any claim term for which I have not provided

14      you with a definition, you should apply the plain and

15      ordinary meaning.        If I've provided you with the definition,

16      however, you must apply my definition to those terms

17      throughout the case.

18                    However, my interpretation of the language of the

19      claims should not be taken by you as an indication that I

20      have any personal opinion regarding the issues, such as

21      infringement and invalidity.            Those issues, ladies and

22      gentlemen, are yours alone to decide.

23                    I'll provide you with more detailed instructions

24      on the meaning of these claims before you retire to

25      deliberate and reach your verdict.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 14 of 127 PageID #: 6918214



1                    In deciding the -- in deciding the issues that are

2      before you, you'll be asked to consider certain specific

3      legal rules, and I'll give you an overview of those rules

4      now.    And then at the conclusion of the case, I'll give you

5      much more detailed instructions.

6                    The first issue that you'll be asked to decide is

7      whether Apple has infringed any of the asserted claims of

8      the patents-in-suit.         Infringement is assessed on a

9      claim-by-claim basis.

10                    And ContentGuard, the Plaintiff, must show you by

11      a preponderance of the evidence that a claim has been

12      infringed.      Therefore, there may be infringement as to one

13      claim but no infringement as to another claim.

14                    There are also a few different ways that a patent

15      can be infringed, and I'll explain the requirements for each

16      of these types of infringement to you in detail at the

17      conclusion of the case.

18                    But in general, Apple may infringe the asserted

19      patents by making, using, selling, or offering for sale in

20      the United States or importing into the United States a

21      product or by performing a method meeting all the

22      requirements of a claim of the asserted patent and without

23      the patent owner's permission.

24                    I'll provide you with more detailed instructions

25      on the requirements for infringement at the conclusion of
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 15 of 127 PageID #: 6918315



1      the case.

2                    The second issue that you'll be asked to decide is

3      whether the asserted patents are invalid.                Invalidity is a

4      defense to infringement; therefore, even though the United

5      States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, has allowed the

6      asserted claims, and even though a patent is presumed to be

7      valid, you, the jury, must decide whether those claims are

8      invalid after hearing all the evidence presented during this

9      trial.

10                    You may find the patent claim to be invalid for a

11      number of reasons, including because it claims subject

12      matter that is not new or because it is obvious.

13                    For a patent claim to be invalid because it is not

14      new, Apple must show by clear and convincing evidence that

15      all of the elements of a claim are sufficiently described in

16      a single previously printed publication or patent.                   We call

17      these items prior art.          If a claim is not new, it is said to

18      be anticipated.

19                    Another way that a claim can be found to be

20      invalid is that it may have been obvious.                Even though a

21      claim is not anticipated because every element of a claim is

22      not shown or sufficiently described in a single piece of

23      prior art, the claim may still be invalid if it would have

24      been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field of

25      technology of the patent at the relevant time.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 16 of 127 PageID #: 6918416



1                    You'll need to consider a number of questions in

2      deciding whether the inventions claimed in the asserted

3      patents are obvious.         I'll provide you with detailed

4      instructions on these questions at the conclusion of the

5      trial.

6                    A patent may also be invalid if its description in

7      the specification does not meet certain requirements.                    To be

8      valid, a patent must meet the written description

9      requirement.

10                    In order to meet this written description

11      requirement, the description of the invention in the

12      specification portion of the patent must be detailed enough

13      to demonstrate that the applicant actually possessed the

14      invention as broadly as it is claimed in the claims of the

15      issued patent.

16                    Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you decide that any

17      claim of the patents-in-suit has been infringed and is not

18      invalid, that is, the presumption of validity has survived,

19      then you'll need to decide what amount of money damages are

20      to be awarded to ContentGuard as compensation for that

21      infringement.

22                    A damage award must be adequate to compensate the

23      patentholder for the infringement and in no event may the

24      damages award be less than what the patentholder would have

25      received had it been paid a reasonable royalty for the use
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 17 of 127 PageID #: 6918517



1      of its patent.

2                    However, the damages you award, if any, are meant

3      to compensate the patentholder and not to punish a

4      defendant.      You may not include in your award any additional

5      amount as a fine or penalty above what is necessary to fully

6      compensate the patentholder for the infringement.

7                    Moreover, damages cannot be speculative, and

8      ContentGuard must prove the amount of its damages for

9      Apple's alleged infringement by a preponderance of the

10      evidence.

11                    I'll give you more detailed instructions on the

12      calculation of damages regarding infringement of the

13      patents-in-suit at the conclusion of the trial, including

14      giving you more specific instructions with regard to the

15      calculation of a reasonable royalty.

16                    However, the fact that I'm instructing you about

17      damages does not mean that ContentGuard is or is not

18      entitled to recover damages.            You will decide that after you

19      have heard all the evidence during the trial.

20                    Now, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to be

21      hearing from a number of witnesses throughout the trial of

22      this case.      And I want you to keep an open mind while you're

23      listening to the evidence, and I want you not to decide any

24      facts until you've heard all the evidence.

25                    While the witnesses are testifying, remember, you
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 18 of 127 PageID #: 6918618



1      will have to decide the degree of credibility and

2      believability to allocate to each witness and to the

3      evidence.

4                    So while the witnesses are testifying, you should

5      be asking yourselves questions like these:                 Does the witness

6      impress you as being truthful?

7                    Does he or she have a reason not to tell the

8      truth?

9                    Does he or she have any personal interest in the

10      outcome of the case?

11                    Does the witness seem to have a good memory?

12                    Did he or she have an opportunity and ability to

13      observe accurately the things they've testified about?

14                    Did the witness appear to understand the question

15      clearly and answer the question directly?

16                    And, of course, does the witness's testimony

17      differ from the testimony of any other witness, and if it

18      does, how does it differ?

19                    These are some of the kinds of things that you

20      should be thinking about while you're listening to each

21      witness during the trial of this case.

22                    I also want to talk to you briefly, ladies and

23      gentlemen, about expert witnesses.              When knowledge of a

24      technical subject may be helpful to you, the jury, a person

25      who has special training and experience in that particular
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 19 of 127 PageID #: 6918719



1      field -- we refer to them as an expert witness -- is

2      permitted to testify to you about his or her opinions on

3      technical matters.

4                    However, you're not to -- you're not required to

5      accept an expert's or any other witness's opinion for that

6      matter.     It's up to you to decide whether you believe an

7      expert witness and whether or not you want to believe what

8      they say or give their testimony any weight or credibility.

9                    I anticipate there will be expert witnesses

10      testifying in support of each side in this case, but it will

11      be up to you, ladies and gentlemen, to listen to their

12      qualifications when they testify, and when they give an

13      opinion and explain the basis for it, you'll have to

14      evaluate what they say and whether you believe it and to

15      what degree, if any, you want to give it any weight.

16                    During the trial, I also anticipate there will be

17      testimony from witnesses that's going to be presented to you

18      through what are called depositions.

19                    In trials like this, it's tough, if not

20      impossible, to get every witness physically here at the same

21      time.     So lawyers for each side, prior to the trial, take

22      the depositions of a witness.

23                    A deposition -- in a deposition, a court reporter

24      is present; the witness is sworn and placed under oath, just

25      as if he were personally in court; and both parties ask the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 20 of 127 PageID #: 6918820



1      witness questions, and those questions and their answers are

2      taken down and recorded.

3                    Portions of those recordings of the questions and

4      answers may be played to you as a part of this trial so that

5      you can see the witness and hear their testimony.

6                    That deposition testimony is entitled to the same

7      consideration, and insofar as possible, is to be judged as

8      to the credibility, weight, and otherwise considered by the

9      jury in just the same way as if the witness had been present

10      and given their testimony from the witness stand in open

11      court.

12                    Now, during the trial, it's possible that the

13      lawyers will make certain objections, and I will make

14      rulings or I will make rulings to those objections.                   It's

15      the duty of an attorney on each side of the case to object

16      when the other side offers testimony or evidence which the

17      attorney believes is not proper under the orders of the

18      Court and the rules of evidence.

19                    Upon allowing testimony or other evidence to be

20      introduced over the objection of an attorney, the Court does

21      not, unless expressly stated, indicate an opinion as to the

22      weight or effect of that evidence.

23                    As I've said before, you, the jury, are the sole

24      judges of the credibility and believability of all the

25      witnesses and the weight and effect to give to all of the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 21 of 127 PageID #: 6918921



1      evidence in the case.          This is a very important part of your

2      job as jurors.

3                    Now, I want to compliment both parties in this

4      case, because up until today, they, with the Court, have

5      worked very hard to go through all the exhibits that will be

6      shown to you during the trial.

7                    And through this pretrial procedure, the Court's

8      already heard arguments and objections about the

9      admissibility of those evidence so that we won't have to

10      listen to those arguments, and I won't have to make those

11      rulings during the course of the trial.

12                    That saved everybody, including you, a lot of

13      time.     And I compliment the parties for that.              That also

14      means that when either party shows you an exhibit, it means

15      I've already ruled on its admissibility, and they'll ask

16      questions about that exhibit, as they wish to, to put it in

17      context.

18                    As I say, both sides have worked hard in

19      streamlining these issues so that we'll save that time

20      during the course of the trial.

21                    However, it's still possible that there will be

22      objections made during the course of the trial.

23                    And if I sustain an objection to a question

24      addressed to a witness, then you must disregard the question

25      entirely and may draw no inference from the wording of it or
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 22 of 127 PageID #: 6919022



1      speculate about what the witness might have said if I had

2      permitted the witness to answer the question.

3                    If I overrule an objection, then you should

4      consider the question and the answer just as if no objection

5      had been made.

6                    You should know, ladies and gentlemen, that the

7      law of the United States permits a judge to comment to the

8      jury regarding the evidence in a case, but such comments

9      from the judge on the evidence are only an expression of the

10      judge's opinion as to that evidence, and the jury may

11      disregard those comments in their entirety, because as I've

12      said, you, the jury, are the sole judges of the facts and

13      the credibility of the witnesses and how much weight to give

14      to their testimony.

15                    And as I indicated to you earlier, even though the

16      law may permit me to comment on the evidence, I'm going to

17      work very hard not to make any comments on the evidence

18      during the course of this trial or the witnesses.

19                    Now, the court reporter in front of me,

20      Ms. Holmes, is here taking down everything that's said

21      during the trial.

22                    However, the transcription of those statements,

23      the written version of everything that's said during the

24      trial, is not going to be available to you for your

25      deliberations in this case.            The transcript is prepared in
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 23 of 127 PageID #: 6919123



1      case there's an appeal of this case to a higher court.

2                    So because that transcript is not going to be

3      available to you, you're going to have to rely on your

4      memories of the testimony and the evidence in this case.

5                    In a moment, each of you are going to be given a

6      juror notebook.        In the back of those notebooks, you'll find

7      that there's a legal pad that you can use to take notes on.

8      It's up to each of you to decide whether or not you want to

9      take notes and how detailed you want your notes to be if you

10      decide to take notes.

11                    But, remember, those notes are for your own

12      personal use.       You have to rely on your memory of the

13      evidence, which is why you should pay close attention to the

14      testimony of each witness.

15                    You should not abandon your own recollection

16      because somebody else's notes indicate something different.

17      Your notes are to refresh your recollection, and that's the

18      only reason you should be keeping them.

19                    I'm now going to ask our court security officer to

20      pass out the juror notebooks to each member of the jury at

21      this time.

22                    In these notebooks, ladies and gentlemen, you'll

23      see that you each of you have a copy of the five asserted

24      patents that we've talked about.

25                    You'll also see in this notebook that you have a
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 24 of 127 PageID #: 6919224



1      listing of the claim terms.            These are the words that are

2      found in the numbered claims in the back of the

3      patents-in-suit that I've told you about.                And along with

4      these claim terms, there are definitions that the Court has

5      given you to work with in regard to those terms.

6                    You'll also find that you have pages in there for

7      witnesses, with a picture of the witness at the top of each

8      page and space below that picture that you can also take

9      notes on.

10                    Whenever the -- you leave for the day, I'm going

11      to ask you to place those juror notebooks on the table in

12      the jury room.       They should either be on the table in the

13      jury room when we're not in session or they should be with

14      you in the jury box.

15                    Now, there may come times when we're going to take

16      a short recess, and it's all right for you to leave your

17      notebooks in your chairs.           And I'll tell you that when that

18      happens.      But unless I tell you otherwise, they should be in

19      your possession or they should be on the table in the jury

20      room.

21                    You'll also find in the back a legal pad that you

22      can take notes on, as I've mentioned.               There should also be

23      a pen in there.

24                    Now, we're going to have opening statements in

25      just a few moments, and I want to give you a brief roadmap
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 25 of 127 PageID #: 6919325



1      of how the trial is going to be structured before we have

2      those opening statements.

3                    After the opening statements have been given, the

4      Plaintiff, ContentGuard, will present its evidence in

5      support of its contentions that some of the claims of the

6      patents-in-suit have been and continue to be infringed by

7      the Defendant, Apple.

8                    To prove infringement of any claim, ContentGuard

9      must persuade you that it is more likely true than not true

10      that Apple has infringed that claim; that is, by a

11      preponderance of the evidence.

12                    Now, after ContentGuard, the Plaintiff, has

13      presented its evidence and rests, Apple, the Defendant, will

14      present its evidence in the case that the asserted claims of

15      the patents-in-suit are invalid.

16                    To prove invalidity of any claim, Apple, the

17      Defendant, must persuade you by clear and convincing

18      evidence that the claim is invalid.

19                    And in addition to presenting evidence of

20      invalidity, the Defendant, Apple, will put on evidence

21      responding to ContentGuard's proof of infringement and

22      damages.

23                    After the Defendant has put on its evidence and

24      rests, the Plaintiff, ContentGuard, may then put on

25      additional evidence responding to Apple's evidence that the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 26 of 127 PageID #: 6919426



1      claims of the asserted patents are invalid or unenforceable

2      and to offer any rebuttal evidence to infringement and

3      damages.      This is referred to as the rebuttal evidence or

4      the rebuttal case.

5                    And after the rebuttal case has been presented by

6      the Plaintiff, then all of the evidence will have been

7      presented to you, the jury.

8                    At that time, the Court will then present to you

9      my final instructions.          Those final jury instruction are

10      often called the Court's charge to the jury.

11                    The lawyers will then present their closing

12      arguments, and after you've heard the closing arguments of

13      the lawyers and receive my final instructions, then I will

14      direct that you retire to the jury room and deliberate upon

15      and reach your verdict.

16                    I also want to repeat my earlier instruction to

17      you that you're not to discuss the case among yourselves

18      during the trial.        Only when you've heard all the evidence

19      and I direct you to retire to the jury room and to

20      deliberate upon your verdict, then can you discuss the case

21      among yourselves.

22                    And at that time, it will be your duty to discuss

23      the case among yourselves.           But until then, you must not

24      communicate among yourselves about the case, the evidence,

25      or anything that occurs during the trial.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 27 of 127 PageID #: 6919527



1                    I also want to remind you, as I indicated during

2      jury selection, that during the course of the trial, as you

3      come and go from the courthouse and during recesses for

4      lunch and other times, you may come in close contact with

5      some of the lawyers in the case or the witnesses or other

6      people associated with one side or the other.

7                    They're not going to talk to you.             They're not

8      going to stop and visit with you.              That's because I've

9      instructed them not to.          And when that doesn't happen, don't

10      consider that they're rude or unfriendly or mean.                   They're

11      simply following the Court's instruction in that regard.

12                    All right.     With these instructions, we'll now

13      hear opening statements from the attorneys.

14                    We'll begin with the Plaintiff.            The Plaintiff may

15      now present its opening statement.

16                    Would you like a warning on your time, Mr. Baxter?

17                    MR. BAXTER:      I would, Your Honor.         If the Court

18      would call me after 10 and after -- and when 2 is left, Your

19      Honor.     When 10 is left and 2 is left, I guess I should say.

20                    THE COURT:     When 10 minutes are left and 2 minutes

21      are left?

22                    MR. BAXTER:      Yes, Your Honor.

23                    THE COURT:     All right.      You may proceed when

24      you're ready.

25                    MR. BAXTER:      Thank you, Your Honor.

1                    May it please the Court.

2                    Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.             As I told you

3      last Monday, my name is Sam Baxter.              I'm with the law firm

4      of McKool Smith, and it's my pleasure to represent

5      ContentGuard in this case.

6                    I thought I might start out by giving you a little

7      information about ContentGuard and what it is and where it

8      came from.

9                    ContentGuard actually started out as a part of

10      Xerox, and the patents in this case were actually a part of

11      the research arm of Xerox and Dr. Mark Stefik.

12                    Dr. Stefik is actually in the courtroom.               He's

13      going to be the first witness.

14                    Stand up for a moment, Dr. Stefik.

15                    Thank you, sir.

16                    You're going to hear from him first, and he's the

17      inventor of four of the patents.             And I think I probably

18      told you on Monday that there are four patents, and four are

19      his.    There are actually five patents in this lawsuit.

20      You'll hear about one more patent later on today.

21                    But Dr. Stefik, as part of Xerox, applied for and

22      received four patents having to do, as we said, with digital

23      rights management.         That was in 1994.

24                    And later on, ContentGuard was formed after Xerox

25      formed this DRM business unit.             They were not able to do
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 29 of 127 PageID #: 6919729



1      much with it, and so they decided to have another entity

2      formed up that they call ContentGuard.

12                    They, too, evolved.          But as you might imagine,

13      with diverse interest, such as Time Warner, Microsoft, and

14      Technicolor, there was not a unity of purpose in this group.

15      What one wanted, the other didn't necessarily want.                   And the

16      way the organization was set up, you had to have unanimity

17      in order to either enforce the patents or to do other

18      research.      And these companies could not agree.

19                    And so in 2011, it was decided that two of the

20      companies, Microsoft and Technicolor, were going to sell

21      their interest.

22                    Time Warner decided to keep their interest, but

23      they sold their interest in what I can only describe to you

24      as a fire sale because they simply could not go forward the

25      way they were.       Their interests were depressed, and Pendrell
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 30 of 127 PageID #: 6919830



1      acquired their interest for $91 million in 2011.

2                    Pendrell, the parent company, moved ContentGuard

3      to Plano, as I said, and our headquarters is in Plano.

4                    Mr. Scott Richardson -- stand up a minute,

5      Mr. Richardson -- is our company representative, and our

6      company is headquartered in Plano --

7                    If I can see the next slide, please, Mr. Diaz.

8                    -- where we have employees and we have an R&D

9      department.      Mr. Richardson is in charge of our R&D

10      department.

11                    And we, in fact, have two products out on the

12      market now.      They're privacy products.           One has to do with

13      sharing emails that's encrypted.

14                    And the other has to do with pictures, a device

15      that would allow a picture to be -- in effect, if it's a

16      Snapchat picture, after 10 seconds, that picture is no

17      longer useable.

18                    As you know, that's sort of a problem among some

19      of our younger folks.          And it makes that picture unusable

20      after 10 seconds.        It can't be -- a picture of it can't be

21      taken and stored forever.

22                    We're working on other products that will soon

23      roll out, and so ContentGuard is developing new apps that

24      will be on the market soon.            But that's who ContentGuard is.

25                    But our problem in this case started much earlier,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 31 of 127 PageID #: 6919931



1      and it started back in the '90s.             And as I told you last

2      Monday, it started because the Internet now is starting to

3      grow and people are understanding that the Internet is a new

4      commerce vehicle, that you're going to be able to do

5      business on the Internet.

6                    And some of the people that understand that are

7      movie companies and TV companies, and, first of all, book

8      publishers, that realized that they can put their product on

9      the Internet.

10                    But there's a problem.         And they had already seen

11      the problem and that the problem is piracy.                 And the problem

12      is that you can get your product on the Internet, but how do

13      you protect it?        How do you keep people from stealing it?

14      Because once it gets on the Internet and it's not protected,

15      you've lost it forever.

16                    And as a result of that, the movie companies and

17      the TV companies and the book publishers simply were not

18      willing to put their product on the Internet.                 There needed

19      to be a solution, and they didn't have one.

20                    Next slide, please.

21                    And the commentators at the time, as we looked at

22      this Monday, said:         We don't have a solution for what is a

23      profoundly new kind of challenge.              We're sailing into the

24      future on a sinking ship.           And there were lots and lots of

25      really bright people that were working on this problem, and
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 32 of 127 PageID #: 6920032



1      there was no solution.

2                    Oddly enough, Dr. Stefik, whose area of expertise

3      was then and is now artificial intelligence, became

4      interested in the problem, and Dr. Stefik said:                  I think

5      I'll work on this problem for a while.               And he got his

6      employers at Xerox to let him, and he came up with a

7      solution.

8                    And basically, here is the Stefik solution, and

9      I'm going to take a small stab, and you're going to hear

10      experts, you're going to hear Dr. Stefik, you're going to

11      hear all kind of people explain its solution, but here's

12      what it is.

13                    If we're going to look on the right-hand side of

14      this slide, you'll see the movie studios and the book

15      publishers can send their content digitally to a server that

16      we're going to call the trusted store and a new word a

17      "repository."

18                    And we're used to that word.           Really it's a place

19      you store things.        And there, that content be encrypted.

20      And that's why we have the little lock here, and it can be

21      stored there, and we know that this is a trusted source.                       We

22      intend to send it there, and it's protected.

23                    On the other end down here on the left, the idea

24      is to have a trusted customer repository, and there, the

25      device-makers come into play, and there they make a device,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 33 of 127 PageID #: 6920133



1      in this case, say an Apple iPhone, and they load that device

2      up originally with software that is designed to handle the

3      content and to be a trusted repository.

4                    That is, it's going to tell the servers back at

5      the home ship:       I'm one of yours.         I'm going to send you a

6      digital certificate that says you made me, I'm safe, I'm

7      secure, and I'm going to send you a message that says, when

8      I order content, I'm going to tell you who I am.                  I'm going

9      to have a log-in, I'm going to have an ID, and you're going

10      to know who I am.        And that software is going to be loaded

11      on to that device when it's made.

12                    So here's how it works:          The content is now

13      sitting on the server back in the trusted repository, and

14      it's encrypted.        And you know what encryption is.             That's

15      coded so nobody can read it unless you've got the certain

16      key to unlock it.

17                    The trusted repository on the customer phone now

18      will send a message back to the content server that says:                      I

19      would like to get a book, and I would like you to send me

20      that book.      And that server knows that it's trusted because

21      it's got an ID.        It sends it an encrypted message.

22                    And then over the Internet, it will send that book

23      in encrypted form, and it actually sends it over a certain

24      pipe on the Internet called a secure socket layer of which I

25      know nothing, but it's a special pipe inside the Internet in
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 34 of 127 PageID #: 6920234



1      which you can encrypt the encryption, and it comes down to

2      your device.

3                    What also comes down to your device is what we

4      discussed briefly Monday, are usage rights.                 And we

5      discussed with you that now the movie studios are willing to

6      do that because there are going to be certain rules and

7      regulations that come along with the content that says what

8      you can do with that content.

9                    Have you brought it?         Have you rented it?        How

10      many times can you watch it?            Can you copy it?        Can you give

11      it to your friends?         Whatever those rules are, they now are

12      loaded on to your mobile device along with the content

13      that's encrypted.

14                    Once you hit play, it's decrypted, at least for a

15      time, but at the same time, the usage rights are applied

16      about what you can do with the content if it's a rental, and

17      it's only a rental for a certain period of time.                  After a

18      while, you can't access it anymore.

19                    If you've purchased that movie or that book,

20      whether or not you can give it to your friends is regulated.

21      What you can do with it, if it's already -- who can watch it

22      and who can't on a particular device.

23                    All of these usage rights are now on the phone,

24      and they are ruling what can be done with that content.                        And

25      that is how the system works.

1                    Now, you're also going to hear about something

2      called integrities.         Now, I'm used to the word "integrity,"

3      but I'm not used to it in the plural.               But you're going to

4      hear about three integrities that are in Dr. Stefik's

5      patents, and you're going to hear a lot about that.

6                    But in summation, here the elements of the

7      inventions, you have usage rights that define how the

8      content may be played or viewed, and you have a trusted

9      repository that has these integrities.

10                    And I'm going to tell you briefly, there are

11      communications integrity, physical integrity, and behavioral

12      integrity, and you're going to hear more about those than

13      you ever wanted to know.

14                    But suffice it to say, those integrities are going

15      to be associated with the devices in the repository, and

16      they are going to enforce the usage rights that are on your

17      mobile device.

18                    And that will allow you to play anywhere, anytime

19      the movie or read the book, whether it's rented or whether

20      you bought it, because it does not then have to be connected

21      to the Internet.        It's on your device, and it's yours to do

22      with as you wish.

23                    Mr. Diaz, the next one.

24                    Well, the patents are applied for.             They've come

25      out.    Dr. Stefik goes on a tour of movies and publishers, he

1      explains the device, and eventually, the industry realizes

2      that Dr. Stefik has been the one that has found the way to

3      have the Internet be the carrier, and a new branch of

4      commerce is developed.

5                    He's now known as the Father of DRM and is widely

6      acclaimed, and you'll see some of this later on in the

7      trial.

8                    Next slide.

9                    The Patent Office, even in its Report to Congress,

10      when it talks about digital rights management -- and this

11      one I'll read to you -- says:            The conceptual underpinnings

12      of trusted computing technology traces back to Dr. Mark

13      Stefik's pioneering work at Xerox PARC.

14                    Xerox PARC is the company that he worked for and

15      still works for at Xerox.

16                    Next slide.

17                    Well, that's going to bring us along to the iTunes

18      system.     And what does it do?         And you're going to hear

19      expert testimony.        You shouldn't rely on me for this at all.

20      But let me give you a brief overview of how the iTunes

21      system works.

22                    The iTunes system works by, once again, the movie

23      or the TV studio sends the content to the iTunes servers.

24      And first of all, it's going to go to the FairPlay servers

25      on the right, and you're going to hear about them, where
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 37 of 127 PageID #: 6920537



1      it's encrypted.        It's assigned ID numbers.

2                    So eventually it's going to be stored, and you

3      have the iPhone here on the left.              And the iPhone is going

4      to be a trusted customer repository because Apple's going to

5      load it with software that will enable it to both handle the

6      content that it gets, and it's going to also identify itself

7      back at the iTunes Store.

8                    And you know that if you've done this, you have to

9      send them your ID when you try to order a movie or a book.

10      And there's the Internet in between.               The movie's encrypted,

11      and if you request a movie, that request goes up to the

12      iTunes Store.

13                    The iTunes Store receives that request, and it

14      will then generate usage rights that are sent back to your

15      phone, and the content is then sent to your phone in an

16      encrypted matter.

17                    And those two together are on your phone, and the

18      usage rights will allow the owner of that phone to watch the

19      movie -- in this case The Avengers -- or to read a book, had

20      it been a book, and they will tell the owner of that phone

21      what they can do with it.           It'll rule it automatically.               And

22      that is exactly the same way that Dr. Stefik's patents

23      explain how to have a trusted system.

24                    There are also going to be -- the three

25      integrities that we talked about are going to be explained
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 38 of 127 PageID #: 6920638



1      by the experts, how they're also on this system:

2                    The communications integrity, which has to do with

3      encryption and the Internet; the physical integrity, which

4      has to do with the phone and how that phone is a trusted

5      repository; and behavioral integrity, which is back up here

6      at the iTunes Store about how those servers I -- Apple knows

7      that those servers are not corrupted and that they are

8      trusted, and that is behavioral integrity.

9                    And the expert's going to explain how those three

10      integrities are found in the Apple system.

11                    Next slide.

12                    Well, I want to anticipate for you just a moment

13      what I think may be some what I'm going to call excuses --

14      Apple is going to call them defenses -- about why they don't

15      infringe.      And here's the very first one.

16                    You're going to hear about something called Akamai

17      servers.      And here's what Apple does.           Apple takes the

18      content of these movies, and instead of storing it up at the

19      iTunes Store, they store it at various servers in another

20      company called Akamai.

21                    Akamai doesn't own the content.            They are just a

22      warehouse.      It's as if Walmart had a warehouse out in Tyler,

23      Texas, or Target, and you just put all your goods there and

24      send trucks to get it.          That's exactly what that is.

25                    When the movie is ordered by the customer, the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 39 of 127 PageID #: 6920739



1      usage rights come down from the iTunes Store, but the movie

2      itself, the content, comes from these Akamai servers, and

3      they both end up on your phone.             But I anticipate Apple's

4      going to say:       Wait a minute, because they come from

5      different servers, then we can't infringe, and that is

6      because of this.

7                    Next slide, Mr. Diaz.

8                    And that is because the patent talks about the

9      usage rights and the content about whether they're attached

10      or treated as attached.

11                    Now, here is the issue for us, and it's a little

12      preview for this.        The patent basically says there are a

13      couple of ways to have the usage rights and the content

14      together.

15                    One is attached, and Judge Gilstrap, in your

16      notebook, has defined in his Markman ruling there's another

17      way and the way that Apple does it, and that is, they're

18      treated as attached.

19                    And the way that I thought about this, and I

20      brought one with me, is the switchblade key fob.                  If you

21      have one of these, you can unlock your car two ways.                    You

22      can take this, and you can stick it in the lock, and you can

23      turn it, and your car will open, and it's attached.                   But you

24      don't have to do that.          You can press this button from some

25      many feet away, right here that says "unlock," and your car
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 40 of 127 PageID #: 6920840



1      will unlock.

2                    And I'm here to tell you that attached would be me

3      sticking it in the lock, but treated as attached, which is

4      the same thing as me pushing the button and the car unlocks.

5      Because what I've sent here is an encrypted, coded message

6      to the door, to the car that says unlock, and it does, and

7      it does it every time.          And this key fob unlocks just that

8      car.

9                    Well, in the iTunes system and in Dr. Stefik's

10      patents, he says that the usage rights and the content can

11      either travel together and be attached, or in the phone,

12      they can be treated as attached.

13                    And what happens in the phone is that the

14      software -- the software in the phone links up the usage

15      rights and the content.          And believe me, that content won't

16      play unless the usage rights are there.                And when you hit

17      play or you hit read, if the usage rights aren't there, if

18      they don't come in and tell the phone what you can do, it

19      won't work.

20                    So I think that's going to be one of their

21      excuses, and we'll see about that.

22                    Here's the second one, and I think you're going to

23      hear about this, is they're going to say:                We've got a

24      different system.        We have something called the secure

25      container system.        There are two different systems:             The
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 41 of 127 PageID #: 6920941



1      trusted system, that's Stefik.             We don't do that, Apple is

2      going to tell you.         We're going to use the secure container

3      system.

4                    And that's really going to be interesting.                And

5      I've got a little sign up here that says trusted system this

6      way, and I'm going to assure you now, that's the road that

7      Apple goes down most of the time.

8                    But there's this secure container approach.

9                    THE COURT:     Ten minutes remaining.

10                    MR. BAXTER:      Thank you, Your Honor.

11                    And they're going to claim they do that all the

12      time.     I'm going to tell you, they do it some of the time.

13      And here's what they do.

14                    Next slide.

15                    Prior to 2009, Apple did the trusted system all

16      the time.      But in 2009, they changed for music alone.                So

17      today, if you download a song from the iTunes store, it will

18      come to your i -- to your phone or your iPad encrypted.                        But

19      once it gets there, there are no usage rights with that

20      song.

21                    Once it's unencrypted, it's there for the world to

22      use.    You can share it with your friends.              You can put it on

23      the Internet if you know how to do that.                There are

24      absolutely no protections on that song.                For whatever

25      reason, Apple decided to change that in 2009.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 42 of 127 PageID #: 6921042



1                    And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a secure

2      container.      It's encrypted when it gets there, but once it's

3      unencrypted, it's fair game for everybody.                 But they do not

4      do that for movies or TV shows or books.

5                    And, of course, the reason is the content owners

6      won't let them do that, because you're not going to be able

7      to get The Avengers on that phone and not have usage rights

8      and have that movie available on the Internet for free.

9      It's not going to happen, and it didn't happen.                  And it

10      doesn't happen -- happen in the Apple system.

11                    Now, let me -- back up just a second, Mr. Diaz.

12      Have you got that patent?

13                    You know, we swap slides before we do this, and we

14      got their slides.        And they're going to tell you, I think --

15      when they say they do this secure container, they're going

16      to say:     Look, here's a ContentGuard patent.              They're going

17      to quote from it, and they're going to say two basic DR

18      (sic) schemes have been employed:              Secure containers and

19      trusted systems.

20                    A secure container or simply an encrypted document

21      offers a way to keep documents, contents encrypted until a

22      set of authorized conditions are met.               And they're going to

23      show that to you.        And that's true.        Absolutely true.

24                    But they're not going to show you the rest of the

25      patent.     Look and see if they do, because here's what the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 43 of 127 PageID #: 6921143



1      rest of the patent says.

2                    Clearly, the secure container approach provides a

3      solution to protecting the document during delivery over

4      insecure channels but does not provide any mechanism to

5      prevent legitimate users from obtaining the clear document

6      and then using and redistributing it in violation of content

7      owners' intellectual property.

8                    Now, that's what the patent really says.               And if

9      they come up here and tell you they're using a secure

10      container system, just ask them, ask them:                 Do you mean to

11      tell me that you're putting those movies out there, and they

12      don't have any usage rights, and everybody can just copy it

13      willy-nilly if they want to, and the movie companies are

14      okay with that?        Because that's not true.

15                    All right.     Mr. Diaz, go back to my slides.

16                    Go back one more.

17                    Well, here are -- here is, in a summary, what we

18      have.     Stefik and Apple both have trusted devices.                They

19      both have enforcement of usage rights on the device to allow

20      anytime, anywhere playback.

21                    And the usage rights is either attached or they're

22      treated as attached to the content in both systems.                   And

23      you're going to find, after you hear the experts, that those

24      are what the basics of the system are, and that's why Apple

25      infringes.

1                    Next slide.      Next slide, Mr. Diaz.

2                    You'll see this, I think, from the expert.                Here's

3      just a screenshot of the -- of the iPhone.                 You see we've

4      got the Antarctica movie here.

5                    And you're going to see -- and this will pop up on

6      your screen, if you get one of these movies.                 Here's the

7      movie, and here it says -- it's in HD -- that it expires in

8      26 days, because you rented it, and then the right to play,

9      which is a manner of use --

10                    Next slide.

11                    -- it shows here that maybe you're camping or on a

12      plane and there's no service, but you can play it anywhere,

13      anytime.

14                    Next slide.

15                    And here it says, if you stopped it in the middle

16      and picked it up an hour later, that it expires in 23 hours.

17      Once again, all of these conditions and usage rights are

18      right there on the Apple phone, and it shows it to you.                        And

19      yet they're going to try to contain -- contend they don't

20      have this, and it's not true.

21                    There are contracts with these content owners

22      saying movies such -- shall at all times be protected by a

23      security solution.         And if they just have a secure

24      container, they don't have that security solution.                   That's

1      music, but they don't have it for movies and books.

2                    Next slide.

3                    Even when Mr. Jobs was alive, the movies -- the

4      memos to him said DM -- DRM is required in this space, and

5      FairPlay, which is their infringing server, is perfect for

6      it.

7                    Next slide.

8                    Let's talk about damages just for a moment.                Here

9      are the infringing sales.           Remember, I told you they had a

10      lot.    419 million plus products have been sold with the

11      infringing device, the device that infringes these patents;

12      706 million pieces of content have been downloaded that

13      infringes.      I told you in opening it was a big number, and

14      that's why the numbers are so big.

15                    Next slide, Mr. Diaz.

16                    Here is the rate that we think is appropriate.                   A

17      little over 1.75, paid one time, for each device, and

18      20 cents for each time a piece of content is downloaded.

19                    Here's my timber slide again.            We think they ought

20      to pay for each time they infringe.              And I just don't

21      understand how anybody can argue with that.

22                    That gets us to the number slightly lower.                We

23      made new calculations.          It's slightly lower than I told you

24      on Monday.      It's $882 million.

25                    And that's a lot of money, and I understand that
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 46 of 127 PageID #: 6921446



1      it is, but 1.75 one time for an infringing device and manage

2      that device that can't download movies and TVs and read

3      books, and would Apple pay 1.75 for that infringing device

4      or 20 cents per book or per movie when they're changing 14

5      and $15 for that movie.          We think that's entirely

6      reasonable.

7                    The fact that they have sold so many of them

8      indicates how popular not only their phone is but also the

9      ability to have this feature on their phone.

10                    Their expert says it's worth a penny.              I'm going

11      to leave that up until -- in your hands eventually to see

12      what it's really worth.

13                    So in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen, we're

14      going to have two competing theories here.                 One is we're

15      going to show you beyond a preponderance of the evidence

16      that they are using Dr. Stefik's patents.

17                    THE COURT:     Two minutes remaining.

18                    MR. BAXTER:      Thank you, Your Honor.

19                    That their system is the same as his invention;

20      that they have trusted repositories back at the iTunes Store

21      and that the iTunes phone itself is a trusted repository;

22      that the usage rights come down from the iTunes Store to the

23      phone, and there, the usage rights are treated as attached

24      to the content and that when you hit play or you hit read,

25      those usage rights kick in, and you cannot play it, you
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 47 of 127 PageID #: 6921547



1      cannot read it unless the usage rights are there, and

2      they're treated as attached to that content, and they stay

3      there forever.

4                    If you buy that movie, those usage rights do not

5      go away, but it allows you to anytime, anywhere view your

6      movie or read the book, which was the genius of Dr. Stefik.

7                    We believe that there won't be any question in

8      your mind that they infringe those patents.

9                    There's also something called a meta-right patent

10      that you're going to hear about how, when the movies are

11      moved from the -- from the content owners to the server, the

12      FairPlay server, that they also infringe that patent.

13                    And we think that 1.75 per device and 20 cents for

14      the content is incredibly low considering the benefit.                    They

15      get to compete in this market.             And to not have that feature

16      would put Apple at a terrible disadvantage, one that they

17      cannot stand and wouldn't stand.

18                    And to think they would only pay a penny is not

19      something that is even imaginable, that they say it's worth

20      that.

21                    We look forward to bringing this case to you, and

22      I thank you for this time this morning.

23                    Thank you, Your Honor.

24                    THE COURT:     All right.      The Defendant may now

25      present its opening argument to the jury.

1                    Mr. Pritikin, would you like a warning on your

2      time?

3                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Yes.    Please, Your Honor.         Could I

4      have a five-minute warning before I get to the end?

5                    THE COURT:     Yes, sir.

6                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Thank you.

7                    THE COURT:     You may proceed when you're ready.

8                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

9      My name is David Pritikin, and I am proud to represent Apple

10      in this case.

11                    Let me tell you one thing right off the bat.

12      Apple does not infringe ContentGuard's patents.                  This case

13      is about digital rights management or DRM, as the term is

14      used, the shorthand.

15                    And that is not the technology that allows movies

16      and books to be delivered over the Internet.                 It is not the

17      technology that allows movies and books to be viewed on an

18      iPhone or an iPad.

19                    DRM technology is technology that limits or

20      controls or restricts what the usage rights can do with the

21      movie or the book that they have purchased online; for

22      example, whether they could copy it or give it to a friend.

23                    Apple was a pioneer in the business of selling

24      digital content over the Internet; first music, then videos

25      and books.      And the iTunes Store, which is shown on your
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 49 of 127 PageID #: 6921749



1      screen here, is where you can go online, if you want to buy

2      movies or -- or books.

3                    Starting over a decade ago, Apple built that

4      business from the ground up.            And as part of that, Apple

5      developed a system of preventing the digital works, the

6      digital content from being pirated or illegally copied.

7                    Apple calls its DRM system FairPlay, and Apple has

8      patents of its own that cover FairPlay in its innovations.

9      Apple does not use ContentGuard's patents.

10                    During voir dire on Monday, Plaintiff's counsel

11      asked everyone if their children would like to use a

12      smartphone that could only make telephone calls.                  The

13      suggestion was that ContentGuard invented all of the

14      interesting things that people do on smartphones, like

15      emailing and texting, surfing the web, using apps.

16                    But ContentGuard doesn't even claim in this

17      lawsuit that it invented all of those things.                 And that's

18      not what this case is about.            This case is about controlling

19      or limiting what users can do with movies and books that

20      they get online.

21                    Now, from listening to Plaintiff's counsel, you

22      might also have gotten the impression that there's no way to

23      restrict or control what users would do with books and

24      movies if you didn't use ContentGuard's patents.                  But you're

25      going to see that that just isn't true.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 50 of 127 PageID #: 6921850



1                    ContentGuard's patents admit that there were DRM

2      systems before these patents.            And, in fact, you're going to

3      see that there is really no dispute that there are ways to

4      do DRM that don't infringe ContentGuard's patents.                   So don't

5      be confused about that.

6                    The issue in this case is not whether Apple has a

7      system for protecting the books and movies that it sells;

8      the question is whether Apple's system is the same as or

9      different from the system that ContentGuard patented, and

10      you're going to see that FairPlay is very different.

11                    Even before the ContentGuard patents, there were

12      two fundamentally different ways to set up a DRM system, and

13      the terms that ContentGuard used to describe the two

14      approaches are secure container and trusted system.

15                    ContentGuard patented a particular type of trusted

16      system, but as you'll see, Apple does use a secure container

17      approach.      And ContentGuard has said that that is different.

18                    The language on this slide comes right out of one

19      of ContentGuard's patents in a section that talks about the

20      background of the invention.            It talks about the history of

21      DRM.    And it says two basic DRM schemes have been employed:

22      Secure containers and trusted systems.

23                    Well, both types of DRM systems existed before the

24      ContentGuard patents.          ContentGuard patented one way to set

25      up a trusted system.         They did not patent the secure
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 51 of 127 PageID #: 6921951



1      container approach.

2                    There are two key features of ContentGuard's

3      trusted system, repositories and usage rights, that are

4      attached or treated as attached to the digital works.

5                    As the patents say, it is these two features that

6      make the invention different from the prior art.                  That was

7      the invention, the combination of attached usage rights and

8      repositories.

9                    So, remember, please, those critical words.

10      You'll hear a lot about them during the trial.                  Repositories

11      and usage rights that are attached or treated as attached to

12      the digital works, those are the critical elements of these

13      patents.

14                    This slide shows how ContentGuard's patented

15      trusted system works.          On the left is Figure 1 that we've

16      taken right out of the patent, and on the right is a drawing

17      that illustrates it in operation.

18                    The basic building blocks of the system are called

19      repositories.       Now, these are very secure computers that are

20      used to protect the digital works, like the movies.                   A

21      computer cannot be considered a ContentGuard repository for

22      purposes of these patents unless certain very strict

23      requirements are met.

24                    The integrities that Plaintiff's counsel alluded

25      to in his opening, these have been defined by Judge
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 52 of 127 PageID #: 6922052



1      Gilstrap, and they're in the juror notebooks that you have.

2                    In ContentGuard's trusted system, the way that you

3      protect the movie or the book is by keeping it inside the

4      trusted system.        That means that you have an end-to-end

5      system of trusted repositories, and you only transfer the

6      movie or the book from one repository to another over secure

7      communications channels.           You prevent the unauthorized use

8      or copying of the content by attaching usage rights to it.

9                    And in the slide that we have, that's signified by

10      the plus sign.       The usage rights have to be attached or

11      treated as attached to the movie.              And the usage rights

12      travel with the movie so that a repository always has them

13      and knows how the movie can be used and what can be done

14      with it.

15                    Now, trusted systems can do other things like

16      encrypting a movie, but the critical elements in these

17      patents and the critical elements of ContentGuard's trusted

18      system are the repositories and the attached usage rights

19      that come along with the content.

20                    The inspiration for ContentGuard's trusted system

21      came from systems that were designed by the United States

22      Department of Defense in the 1980s to safeguard national

23      security and military secrets.             This type of system, as

24      you'd expect, is very secure, but it's complicated.                   And

25      Apple did not believe it needed that type of security for
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 53 of 127 PageID #: 6922153



1      its online business of music and books and -- and videos.

2                    The secure container approach that Apple uses is

3      very different.        It relies on encryption and keys to prevent

4      unauthorized distribution of content.               Encryption, as you

5      probably know, is taking the digital work, like a movie, and

6      putting it into a form where you can't really view it or use

7      it.

8                    In this illustration, you can see the movie on the

9      left being encrypted and then decrypted.                And you can see

10      why the -- this is called the secure container approach,

11      because when you encrypt the movie or book, it's like

12      putting it into a secure container.

13                    You need a key on your device to decrypt it, or

14      carrying out the same analogy, to unlock the container and

15      get the movie out of it.

16                    With the secure container approach, the use of the

17      content is controlled by the delivery and use of keys that

18      the user can use to unlock the container.

19                    Now, it's a very flexible system.             You can send

20      the keys to the user's devices separately whenever they're

21      needed.     You don't need heavy-duty ContentGuard repositories

22      because the encrypted content can be safely stored on any

23      kind of a device.

24                    And you don't need to attach the usage rights to

25      the content to tell the repository what it can and it cannot
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 54 of 127 PageID #: 6922254



1      do.    You just control when the user's device gets the keys

2      and when they can use them.

3                    This slide shows Apple's system, and instead of

4      the trusted system approach that was patented by

5      ContentGuard, Apple's FairPlay is the kind of DRM system

6      that ContentGuard called a secure container.

7                    And here's an overview of how it works.               The

8      user's device is shown at the bottom, John's device.                      In

9      this illustration, it's a tablet.              And he orders the movie

10      online from Apple's servers, which are shown in the upper

11      left-hand corner.

12                    Apple's servers -- excuse me -- the movies and the

13      books that Apple sells or rents are stored on servers that

14      are owned and operated by another company called Akamai, as

15      Plaintiff's counsel indicated, and those are shown in the

16      upper right.

17                    Once the purchase or the rental transaction is

18      completed, John's device will contact the Akamai server,

19      which will then transmit the movie to the device.

20                    Now, the reason why Apple uses Akamai to store

21      movies and books is that Akamai has servers located all over

22      the United States.         So the downloads come faster than if

23      they came from one location.            And many Internet businesses

24      use Akamai servers for exactly the same reason.

25                    When the movie is sent from the Akamai server to
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 55 of 127 PageID #: 6922355



1      John's device, it is encrypted.             Two keys are needed in

2      Apple's system to decrypt the movie, and both of these keys

3      come from the Apple servers on the left.                This is a secure

4      container system because it relies on encryption and keys.

5                    Now, ContentGuard's patents, in the passage that

6      Plaintiff's counsel talked about, criticize the secure

7      container approach.         They say that a problem with the secure

8      container approach is that once the keys are on the user's

9      device, the content can be encrypted, and then it can be

10      illegally copied by everyone.

11                    Now, Apple's system has that vulnerability, and it

12      would be more secure if Apple had chosen to implement a

13      trusted system.        It didn't.      Apple did not believe that the

14      added security of a trusted system was worth all of the

15      complexity that it would introduce.

16                    Instead, Apple was able to minimize this problem

17      in a different way.         A decade ago, Apple purchased important

18      technology from a company called Cloakware, and you'll hear

19      about that during the trial.            That technology hides the keys

20      on the user's device.

21                    So even though the keys are there, it is very

22      difficult for a hacker to find the keys and to use them when

23      he's not supposed to.          Apple paid Cloakware for the right to

24      use the Cloakware technology.            And to be clear, Cloakware is

25      an important part of Apple's system, but it has nothing to
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 56 of 127 PageID #: 6922456



1      do with ContentGuard's patents.

2                    Now, I want to talk a little more specifically

3      about the reasons why Apple does not infringe these patents.

4      Apple's system does not use the critical elements of the

5      trusted repositories or the usage rights that are attached

6      or treated as attached to the movies and the books.

7                    Let's start with the repositories.             The Apple

8      servers that are in the upper left-hand corner administer

9      the system of selling and renting digital content and send

10      the keys.      These servers are not ContentGuard-type

11      repositories because they don't meet the Court's definition,

12      the requirements to be a repository in these patents.

13                    What about the Akamai servers in the upper

14      right-hand corner?         If this were a trusted system of the

15      kind that ContentGuard patented, those would need to be

16      repositories, too.         But you're going to find out that

17      ContentGuard doesn't even argue that those are repositories.

18                    And finally, the devices on the bottom on which

19      the movies are watched would have to be repositories as well

20      to be using ContentGuard's trusted system, but in the Apple

21      system, they're not.

22                    During the trial, you're going to learn in detail

23      why none of the servers and the devices qualify as

24      ContentGuard repositories in the kind of trusted system that

25      they patented.

1                    For now, I'm going to talk about just one of the

2      reasons why they're not.           ContentGuard's patents require

3      repositories to be set up so that new software that could

4      compromise the protection of the digital works cannot be

5      installed on them unless the software includes something

6      that is called a digital certificate, an authentication

7      that's within it.

8                    In this slide, you can see the software on the

9      left that has the digital certificate can be installed, but

10      on the right, the software that doesn't have the digital

11      certificate can't be installed.

12                    If you set it up so that it will not accept, you

13      can't install the software that lacks the digital

14      certificate, that is a requirement for a ContentGuard

15      repository.      And Apple's servers do not require software to

16      include digital certificates.

17                    And what about the second critical element of

18      ContentGuard's trusted system, the usage rights?

19                    Going back to the slide showing Apple's system, in

20      Apple's secure container system, the encrypted movie is sent

21      from the Akamai server without any usage rights that are

22      attached to it or treated as attached to it.                 They're not

23      there.     If Apple were using ContentGuard's trusted system,

24      then usage rights would have to travel with the movie from

25      the Akamai server.

1                    MR. BAXTER:      Your Honor, I may not object.            That's

2      in violation to the Court's instruction.                He's done it

3      twice.

4                    THE COURT:     Approach the bench, counsel.

5                    (Bench conference.)

6                    THE COURT:     What's the problem, Mr. Baxter?             This

7      is highly unlikely.

8                    MR. BAXTER:      Direct violation of the Court's

9      instructions that those things had to be permanently

10      attached.      That's exactly what the Court told him he

11      couldn't do.

12                    THE COURT:     You want to respond?

13                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Sure.     That's not what I'm saying

14      at all.     If they're permanently attached, they have to be

15      there all the time going back to when they're created.                    What

16      I'm saying is they've got to be attached when they're

17      traveling.

18                    We can argue that.         That's squarely within the

19      Court's construction.          It's fair ground for argument.

20                    MR. BAXTER:      And that's what they argued at

21      Markman.      That's what the Court ruled against them, Judge.

22      That's exactly what they're arguing.               That's what the Court

23      said is not right.

24                    THE COURT:     As I recall, we argued in the last

25      trial about whether they have to travel together or whether
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 59 of 127 PageID #: 6922759



1      they have to combine at the end.             That's an open question

2      then.     I think it's still an open question here.

3                    And I do not accept in the most rare

4      circumstances.       I don't appreciate counsel being interrupted

5      during his opening statement.

6                    MR. BAXTER:      And I don't do it lightly, Your

7      Honor.     But it is the critical point in this case, that it

8      is a violation of what the Court said was the Markman ruling

9      in this case.

10                    THE COURT:     Well, are you prepared to move on in

11      your opening, Mr. Pritikin?

12                    MR. PRITIKIN:      I want to cover this point.            This

13      is a fair point.        I don't have much more on it.            It was

14      terribly disruptive for him to call me out in the middle of

15      this.     I'm near the end of this.

16                    THE COURT:     You finish your opening.           This is not

17      argument.      This is evidence.

18                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Sure.     I'm explaining the way it

19      works here.

20                    THE COURT:     I understand.       Let's continue.

21                    (Bench conference concluded.)

22                    THE COURT:     All right.      For the record, the

23      objection is overruled.          You may continue with your opening

24      statement, Mr. Pritikin.

25                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Thank you, Your Honor.

1                    As I said, in Apple's secure container approach

2      that's shown here, the usage rights don't travel with the

3      movie as it comes down from the Akamai server to the device.

4                    Now, Apple protects the content differently.                As I

5      said, in Apple's secure container approach, the use of the

6      content is controlled by the keys that come separately from

7      the Apple servers.

8                    When ContentGuard applied for its patents, these

9      are the statements shown on the screen.                Not my words; these

10      are the statements that ContentGuard made to the United

11      States Patent Office.

12                    They told the Patent Office that the trusted

13      system approach that it patented is different from the

14      secure container approach.           And now years later, when

15      ContentGuard is trying to collect almost a billion dollars

16      from Apple, it's going to be telling you the exact opposite

17      and that its patents cover both.

18                    These are some examples of some Apple product that

19      is you may have seen.          And the key to Apple's products

20      they're easy to use.         They make sense.        They're easy to

21      figure out.      Children can use the iPads.

22                    When Apple's engineers began FairPlay over a

23      decade ago, they followed the same tried and true Apple

24      approach.

25                    One of the witnesses you're going to hear from
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 61 of 127 PageID #: 6922961



1      during the trial is Dr. Bud Tribble, who is Apple's vice

2      president of software technology.              Dr. Tribble is Apple's

3      computer expert at this trial and is sitting at counsel

4      table with us.

5                    Dr. Tribble could you stand up, please?

6                    Dr. Tribble first went to work for Apple back in

7      1980, just a few years after the company started.                   He left

8      in 1985 and returned in 2001.

9                    Dr. Tribble was involved in the design of

10      FairPlay, and he'll explain what Apple was trying to do.

11      When Apple launched the iTunes Store in 2003, Apple wanted a

12      DRM system that was simple and that would not complicate

13      things for customers.          And the history explains why.

14                    At the time, there was a lot of free music that

15      was available that could be put on music players that people

16      had.    People copied songs from the CDs they owned, or they

17      downloaded them from some illegal website where people would

18      share their music.

19                    Steve Jobs and others at Apple had the insight

20      that if you charge only 99 cents for a song, people would be

21      willing to pay for them and buy them rather than to go to

22      the trouble of getting them from their CDs or from illegal

23      websites.

24                    The music companies were interested in this idea,

25      but they were nervous about making their songs available
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 62 of 127 PageID #: 6923062



1      online, and they wanted some type of DRM system so that

2      their music couldn't be freely copied.

3                    But here's the catch.         If you made the DRM system

4      too complex or too burdensome, then consumers wouldn't buy

5      the music, and they'd go back to getting the free stuff.

6                    Mr. Jobs, Dr. Tribble, and others from Apple

7      convinced the music companies that this online business

8      would be a good deal for them and that if you did it

9      right -- you did it right with a DRM system that didn't

10      inconvenience the customers and wasn't too complicated,

11      everyone would come out ahead.             And it turned out that Apple

12      was right.

13                    By 2007, the music companies no longer thought DRM

14      protection was very important, and they agreed to let Apple

15      begin selling music that had no DRM protection.                  Since 2009,

16      all of the music sold by Apple has no DRM protection.

17                    Now, I was interested in the comments I heard from

18      Plaintiff's counsel this morning about how the DRM-free

19      music that Apple sells uses the secure container approach,

20      and the other things, like books and movies, use what they

21      say is their system.

22                    Well, that isn't exactly the position that

23      ContentGuard's expert has taken in this case.

24      ContentGuard's expert thinks that the free music, the DRM

25      free music that Apple sells also uses that system.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 63 of 127 PageID #: 6923163



1                    So when they tell you now that that uses the

2      secure container, it's not consistent with what their expert

3      has said before.

4                    When Apple's engineers began to design FairPlay,

5      there was a fair amount of public literature on different

6      types of DRM schemes and many that dated back before

7      ContentGuard's work.

8                    There were complicated approach (sic) like

9      ContentGuard's trusted systems where you set up this

10      end-to-end system of repositories and you had usage rights

11      that are attached.         But there were also simpler approaches

12      like the secure container approach where you encrypt the

13      digital content, and then you use keys to control the usage.

14                    Apple chose the inscription and key system that's

15      based on the secure container approach.                And they recognize

16      that you need to balance the level of security with

17      commercial needs and ease of use.

18                    Apple also understood that a simple encryption and

19      key system, a type of secure container, would work just fine

20      for the business that it had.

21                    Now, let me be clear on one thing.             I'm not

22      telling you that Apple's FairPlay system is not secure.                        It

23      is secure.      And you'll see documents that talk about the

24      security and the trust that exists in Apple's system.                    And

25      Apple is proud of FairPlay.            A lot of hard work went into
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 64 of 127 PageID #: 6923264



1      building it.

2                    But a trusted system, as it's defined by these

3      patents, as it's defined by ContentGuard, has special

4      requirements for repositories and usage rights, and that is

5      why Apple does not have a trusted system as it was patented

6      by ContentGuard.

7                    At the end of the trial, to decide whether Apple

8      infringes, you'll need to compare Apple's system to the

9      requirements of the claims of ContentGuard's patents, and

10      all of the claim elements have to be present.

11                    As this simple example illustrates, even if three

12      of four claim elements seem to be found in a product or in

13      the service, there's no infringement because they all have

14      to be present in order for infringement to exist.

15                    This slide shows all five of the claims from

16      ContentGuard's patents in this lawsuit.                And we've

17      highlighted the terms "repository" and "usage rights."                    And

18      you can see in those claims how critical those elements are

19      to the ContentGuard trusted system.

20                    A second issue in this case is whether

21      ContentGuard's patents are valid.

22                    Now, if you conclude that ContentGuard can't prove

23      infringement -- and we think that is what you will conclude

24      when you hear all of the evidence -- it doesn't matter in

25      some senses whether the patents are valid or not because the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 65 of 127 PageID #: 6923365



1      case is going to be over.

2                    Now, there's not much difference between what is

3      in ContentGuard's patents and what was already known to the

4      world before the patent applications were filed.                  No one's

5      entitled to a patent if the work that was done by others

6      would have made it obvious to skilled people working in the

7      field.

8                    To determine if a patent is valid, you look at

9      earlier patents, publications, systems.                This is called the

10      prior art, and you're going to hear about the prior art

11      during the trial.        And we think the evidence is going to

12      show that these patents are not valid.

13                    THE COURT:     You have five minutes remaining,

14      Counsel.

15                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Thank you, Your Honor.

16                    So why are we here?        When ContentGuard was first

17      formed, it initially hoped to develop and market a DRM

18      system that it could sell to other companies, but it was

19      never able to build a market for products that use these

20      patents.

21                    Around 2005, they focused on trying to license the

22      patents to other companies.

23                    In 2011, a company called Pendrell bought up

24      90 percent of ContentGuard, and two years later, in 2013,

25      this lawsuit was filed.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 66 of 127 PageID #: 6923466



1                    Now, you heard Plaintiff's counsel say that they

2      want almost a billion dollars from Apple in this case.                    But

3      let me tell you, ContentGuard's -- that is the amount they

4      say Apple would have paid for a license to these patents in

5      2005.

6                    ContentGuard's internal business records tell a

7      very different story.          It turns out that ContentGuard

8      actually put a value on a license to Apple.

9                    In 2005, their documents show they thought a

10      reasonable amount for Apple to pay for a license to all of

11      ContentGuard's patents, worldwide, not just the five patents

12      in this case, was $16 million.

13                    And in 2008, after the iPhone had been launched,

14      they thought it would be valued at $30 million.                  These are a

15      far cry from the $882 million you're going to hear about in

16      this case.

17                    And this slide shows the amounts that other

18      companies have paid for licenses to ContentGuard's patents.

19      As you can see, small amounts in comparison to the red bar,

20      the 882 million they say Apple should pay for a license to

21      the five patents.

22                    These other companies got hundreds of patents

23      worldwide, and four of the five patents that are in this

24      lawsuit have already expired.

25                    To put things in further perspective, in 2011,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 67 of 127 PageID #: 6923567



1      Pendrell filed an official disclosure with the Securities

2      and Exchange Commission saying that the value of all of

3      ContentGuard, the whole business, including ownership of all

4      of the patents, was around a hundred million dollars.

5                    Now, if Pendrell thought that a license to Apple

6      was worth almost a billion dollars, they surely would have

7      told the SEC that the whole company was worth a lot more

8      than a hundred million dollars.

9                    As you listen to the testimony, I'm going to ask

10      you to think about what ContentGuard said before this

11      lawsuit and what it's telling you now.

12                    Pay close attention to what ContentGuard said in

13      its business documents to the Patent Office and to the SEC

14      and compare what they said to them with what their paid

15      witnesses tell you in this courtroom.               And this is true on

16      both infringement and the damages side of the case.

17                    Back at the time, they said trusted systems and

18      secure containers were different.              Today, they're telling

19      you they're the same.          Back then, they said a license to

20      Apple was worth $30 million.            Today they're telling you it's

21      worth almost a billion.          And you'll see more examples of

22      this as we go through the trial.

23                    The technology in this case is difficult, but

24      you're going to be surprised at how much of it you

25      understand by the time the trial is over.

1                    In the end, ContentGuard hopes that you're going

2      to throw up your hands and find that Apple infringes just

3      because it has a system for protecting digital content.                        But

4      we ask you not to be confused by that.               We ask that you

5      listen to our side of the case.

6                    We go second.      Before reaching any conclusions,

7      that you take a close look at the actual claim requirements

8      and at Apple's products and services and that you apply the

9      law as Judge Gilstrap instructs you.

10                    And if you do that, we're confident that you'll

11      conclude that Apple does not infringe.

12                    We know all of you have other obligations and that

13      spending time on this jury is a big sacrifice.                  Apple

14      appreciates your service.           And I want to thank you in

15      advance for your time and your attention in this matter.

16                    Apple has faith in the American jury service, and

17      we trust you to listen carefully to the evidence and to

18      reach the right result.

19                    Thank you.

20                    THE COURT:     All right.      We've now heard opening

21      statements from both sides.            If there are persons present in

22      the courtroom who intend to testify during this trial, I'd

23      like all the witnesses to come forward at this time so they

24      can be sworn collectively by our courtroom deputy.                   If

25      you're going to be a witness in this case, please come
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 69 of 127 PageID #: 6923769



1      forward now.

2                    (Witnesses sworn.)

3                    THE COURT:     Thank you.      You may return to your

4      seats.

5                    Counsel, does either side wish to invoke the Rule?

6                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Yes, we do, Your Honor.

7                    THE COURT:     I assume, Mr. Pritikin, that your

8      request to invoke the Rule excludes expert witnesses and

9      corporate representatives at counsel table?

10                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Yes, sir.

11                    THE COURT:     All right.      The Rule has been invoked,

12      as clarified.       Unless you are an expert witness or unless

13      you are the designated representative of either party seated

14      at the counsel table and you are going to testify in this

15      case, you must remain outside the courtroom until such time

16      as you're actually called to testify.

17                    We are going to take a short recess.              Those of you

18      that fall under the Rule, I'll expect you to be outside the

19      courtroom when we come back.

20                    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we're going to

21      take a short recess at this time before the Plaintiff calls

22      their first witness.

23                    You may leave your notebooks in your chairs.                This

24      should be 10 or 12 minutes in length, approximately.                    Don't

25      discuss the case among yourselves.              And we'll have you back
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 70 of 127 PageID #: 6923870



1      in here shortly to proceed with the witness -- the

2      Plaintiff's first witness.           But you're excused for recess at

3      this time.

4                    (Jury out.)

5                    THE COURT:     All right.      Be seated, please.

6                    I can't remember the last time counsel interrupted

7      an opening statement with an objection.                It's highly

8      unusual, and it's highly disruptive.               Mr. Baxter,

9      Mr. Pritikin, we're going to get to the bottom of the issue

10      right now.

11                    In the preceding trial with Google, there was

12      argument and evidence offered about whether the usage rights

13      must be attached or treated as attached as they travel to

14      their ultimate destination.            That was a disputed difference

15      of opinion during that trial, and I assumed it would be the

16      same in this trial.

17                    But that's what I understood the basis of your

18      objection was, Mr. Baxter.           You want to clarify your

19      position for me?

20                    MR. BAXTER:      I do, Your Honor.

21                    As the Court remembers, Your Honor, that was a --

22      a large fight at the Markman hearing.               And the Defendants

23      argued that attached meant they had to always be together

24      and they had to travel together.             And the Court ruled that

25      was incorrect.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 71 of 127 PageID #: 6923971



1                    THE COURT:     Well, the Defendant argued that they

2      had to be permanently attached, and the Court rejected that

3      in the claim construction order.

4                    MR. BAXTER:      Which meant they had to travel

5      together.      There can be no other choice than that.               They

6      have to be permanently attached, they.               Have to travel

7      together.      That is, in fact, one way of doing it.

8                    But the alternative is they be treated as

9      attached, which means they don't have to travel together.

10                    And what Mr. Pritikin had already said, and I kept

11      my seat and I didn't say anything, is that they had to

12      travel together.        They always had to be permanently

13      attached, and that is incorrect, Your Honor.

14                    And when he said it again, I thought we might as

15      well have -- and I don't want to interrupt.                 I don't believe

16      in that.

17                    THE COURT:     I don't think you would have liked it

18      if he had interrupted you.

19                    MR. BAXTER:      No, sir, I would not have.           But if I

20      had said something that was patently wrong, I would expect

21      him to do so.       If I had -- if I had done something that was

22      in violation of the Markman ruling, I think he would do it.

23      And that is in violation of the Court's ruling, Your Honor.

24                    If they had to be permanently attached, then they

25      have to be -- they have to travel together.                 But if they
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 72 of 127 PageID #: 6924072



1      don't have to be permanently attached, they don't have to

2      travel together.        And what he said was they had to travel

3      together, which means they have to be permanently attached,

4      and that is incorrect.

5                    Now, I don't know any other way to put it, but

6      that's in violation of what the Court said the rules were in

7      this case.

8                    THE COURT:     All right.      Let me hear from

9      Mr. Pritikin.

10                    MR. PRITIKIN:      Your Honor, I thought I was -- you

11      had given us guidance, I believe it was last week, that we

12      would try to apply your claim construction here pretty much

13      as it had been done in the Google trial.                Honestly, I

14      thought that's what I was doing.             I know -- I listened to

15      part of it.      I read the transcript.          That was the argument

16      there.

17                    Our position is that attached or treated as

18      attached means that they would travel together.                  It's not

19      permanent.      There are times that they could be separated.

20      And that wasn't the reason why the Court, so far as we can

21      tell, rejected the notion that they don't have to be

22      permanent.

23                    In his opening, Mr. Baxter talked about them

24      traveling together.         I don't have the transcript yet, but I

25      distinctly recall him saying that they travel together --
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 73 of 127 PageID #: 6924173



1      the usage rights travel together.

2                    And based on the way the Court has tried to apply

3      the claim construction, we think that this is just the fair

4      ground for argument in the course of these proceedings.

5      Nothing extraordinary about it.

6                    THE COURT:     All right.      Thank you.      Let me tell

7      you where the Court is on this.

8                    I agree with the Defendant.           The Court's claim

9      construction rejected the notion that the usage rights must

10      be permanently attached, and the Court construed it as

11      attached or treated as attached.

12                    Whether or not they have to travel together was

13      argued in the Google trial.            The Defendant said they had to

14      travel together, and if they didn't, they shouldn't be

15      considered treated as attached and the Plaintiffs said they

16      don't have to travel together to still be treated as

17      attached.      They only have to attach at the smartphone or the

18      tablet when they come together and the content is made

19      accessible.

20                    That was two different positions argued throughout

21      the Google trial.        I didn't find then that it conflicts with

22      the Court's claim construction order.               I don't find now that

23      it conflicts with the claim construction order.

24                    It's just simply two different positions that both

25      of you are entitled to argue.            And the jury will decide at
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 74 of 127 PageID #: 6924274



1      the end of the day whether these usage rights are treated as

2      attached or not treated as attached.

3                    And whether they do or don't travel together will

4      be one of the factors they consider in determining

5      ultimately whether they travel or whether they are treated

6      as attached or not.

7                    I think your objection was improper and without

8      support, Mr. Baxter.         I think it's disrupted the trial from

9      the very beginning, and I'm going to deduct 15 minutes of

10      your trial time in light of what's happened.

11                    We're going to take a short recess, counsel.

12      We're going to return, and at that time, the Plaintiff will

13      call their first witness.           I don't expect this issue to come

14      up again during the trial.

15                    COURT SECURITY OFFICER:          All rise.

16                    (Recess.)

17                    (Jury out.)

18                    COURT SECURITY OFFICER:          All rise.

19                    THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

20                    All right.     Is the Plaintiff prepared to call

21      their first witness?

22                    MR. BAXTER:      We are, Your Honor.

23                    Could I -- could I approach the podium just a

24      second about -- about --

25                    THE COURT:     You want to raise something new,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 75 of 127 PageID #: 6924375



1      Mr. Baxter?

2                    MR. BAXTER:      Well, sort of, Your Honor.           Given the

3      Court's ruling, I wondered if I can -- if I can -- because I

4      want to object again.

5                    Can I get a standing objection to any testimony or

6      mention by the Defendant about the -- the usage rights and

7      the content having to travel together?               I don't want to

8      object every time.

9                    THE COURT:     I'll give you a running objection on

10      the same basis that we discussed earlier.

11                    MR. BAXTER:      Thank you, Your Honor.

12                    THE COURT:     Okay.

13                    MR. BAXTER:      Thank you, Your Honor.

14                    Yes, sir, Your Honor.         We're ready to proceed.

15                    THE COURT:     All right.      Let's bring in the jury,

16      please.

17                    (Jury in.)

18                    THE COURT:     Please be seated.

19                    Plaintiff, call your first witness.

20                    MR. BAXTER:      Call Dr. Mark Stefik, Your Honor.

21                    THE COURT:     All right.      Dr. Stefik, if you'll come

22      forward, please.        You've already been sworn.           If you'll just

23      have a seat here at the witness stand.

24                    All right, Counsel.        You may proceed.

25                    MR. BAXTER:      Thank you, Your Honor.

1          MARK STEFIK, Ph.D., PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS, PREVIOUSLY SWORN

2                                    DIRECT EXAMINATION

3      BY MR. BAXTER:

4      Q       Would you tell the jury your name, please?

5      A       Yes, sir.     I am Mark, Dr. Mark Stefik.

6      Q       And, Dr. Stefik, you're an inventor of certain patents,

7      are you not?

8      A       Yes, sir, I am.

9      Q       All right.     And you're inventor of at least some of the

10      patents at issue here today, are you not?

11      A       Yes, sir.     I'm an inventor on four of them.

12      Q       Four out of the five?

13      A       Yes, sir.

14      Q       All right.     Do you have any other patents, sir?

15      A       I have approximately a hundred patents, sir.

16      Q       Okay.

17                      MR. BAXTER:     Can we see the slides of the patent

18      and see if --

19      Q       (By Mr. Baxter) Now, these patents, as Judge Gilstrap

20      mentioned, they've got long numbers, and we're going to call

21      them by their last three digits.

22              Is that okay, Dr. Stefik?

23      A       Yes, sir.

24      Q       And that would be the '859, the '072, the '956, and the

25      '007?
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 77 of 127 PageID #: 6924577



1      A      Yes, sir.

2      Q      And these are your patents?

3      A      These are my patents.

4      Q      Okay.    Generally speaking, what do these patents

5      describe, Dr. Stefik?

6      A      These patents are essentially about keeping digital

7      content, books and movies and things like that, safe on

8      computers for publishers.

9      Q      All right, sir.       Can I get you to tell the jury a

10      little bit about your education after you graduated from

11      high school, Dr. Stefik?

12      A      Yes, sir.     I -- after high school, I went to Stanford

13      University where I got a bachelor's degree in mathematics.

14      And then after that, I went on to get a Ph.D, also from

15      Stanford, in computer science.             My specialty is artificial

16      intelligence.

17      Q      And would you give the jury at least a thumbnail sketch

18      of what artificial intelligence is?

19      A      Artificial intelligence is an attempt to make computers

20      have small cognitive abilities like humans do.                  In fact, the

21      focus of my current work is on combining human and

22      artificial intelligence to make better systems.

23      Q      There's been a good bit of press, at least, about

24      artificial intelligence.           Is that something that the public

25      needs to kind of worry about?
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 78 of 127 PageID #: 6924678



1      A      Well, I think there's good reason for debate on that,

2      sir.    And it's important that artificial intelligence be

3      made safe.      It's one of the reasons I'm working in it, sir.

4      Q      Okay.    Who are you currently employed with, if you are?

5      A      I am employed by Xerox PARC.            It's the Xerox sort of

6      invention laboratory that was mentioned earlier.                  So Xerox

7      PARC is a subsidiary of the Xerox Corporation.

8      Q      That microphone is going to pop and whistle if you get

9      too close.      If you get too far away, Judge Gilstrap is going

10      to say that we can't hear you.             So kind of be mindful of the

11      microphone, okay?

12      A      Yes, sir.

13      Q      Thank you.

14             What is your position that -- at Xerox now?

15      A      I'm a research fellow, which is the highest research

16      position.      And I am also a manager of a research group.

17      Q      And what is your group doing right now, Dr. Stefik?

18      A      My group is focused on building human plus computer

19      teams with artificial intelligence.

20      Q      Okay.    I'm going to go into that in just a few moments,

21      but have you always worked with Xerox?

22      A      Well, I have worked there for a long time.                I did work

23      for Stanford University for a brief period.

24      Q      Okay.    When did you join Xerox?

25      A      In 1980.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 79 of 127 PageID #: 6924779



1      Q       And why did you join Xerox?

2      A       Well, there are a couple of reasons.             One of them was

3      that I saw this as a place to invent.               So like-minded people

4      there who wanted to create the future, and I was excited by

5      that.

6              It was also a place which, at that time, had the best

7      computers in the world for researchers, at least a decade or

8      so ahead of everybody else.

9      Q       All right, sir.      And why were you inspired to be an

10      inventor?

11      A       Well, sir, that's -- on reflection, this goes back a

12      long time.      When I was a young man, or actually, a boy, my

13      parents took me to Menlo Park, New Jersey, which is where

14      Thomas Edison's laboratories were.              He's the man famous for

15      inventing the lightbulb and things like that.

16              And I remember touring those laboratories.               I was

17      amazed.     There was building after building and workbench

18      after workbench where Edison and his colleagues invented the

19      lightbulb, motion pictures, record players, and things like

20      this.

21              And I think it planted in my mind the idea of being an

22      inventor and the idea that you couldn't work for an

23      invention laboratory, and I think that actually shaped me.

24      Q       And is that why you finally got into computers and

25      computer science?
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 80 of 127 PageID #: 6924880



1      A      Well, it's certainly part of the way.               That's a fair

2      question, yes, sir.

3      Q      What got you interested in artificial intelligence?

4      A      Well, it's always been kind of a leading edge of much

5      of what happens in computer science.               It's -- oh,

6      timesharing came out of artificial intelligence, who would

7      know that.

8             Many of the things we see in computers everywhere, even

9      the Apple products, Siri, which is answering questions and

10      so on, is based on artificial intelligence.

11             I was at Stanford when artificial intelligence was

12      really expanding greatly, and I really enjoyed the

13      colleagues and the things we could create.

14      Q      Do you have any books or publications that you've done,

15      Dr. Stefik?

16      A      Yes, I do, sir.

17      Q      And tell us a little bit about those.

18      A      Okay.    I think I have a slide for that.

19      Q      Okay.

20      A      Yes.    Well, these are four of my books.             The big green

21      book is a textbook in artificial intelligence that I wrote.

22             The next one is Internet Dreams.             That's a book I wrote

23      which -- of the writings of several people about the

24      Internet, just the time when it was becoming important.                        And

25      so that -- that's called Internet Dreams.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 81 of 127 PageID #: 6924981



1             Internet Edge is a book I wrote a few years after that

2      when I was interested in the challenges, both social and

3      technical and legal, about realizing the promise of the

4      Internet I talked about in the first book.

5             The last book, my most recent book, is called

6      Breakthrough, is what I wrote with my wife when I was

7      manager of a laboratory at PARC.             And it's about the

8      practices of innovation and invention and how to be

9      effective at it.

10             So I think reflection -- it'd be reflective of my own

11      life as an inventor.

12      Q      And what does Mrs. Stefik do?

13      A      She is a psychologist, sir.

14      Q      Does she have a Ph.D. as well?

15      A      Yes, she does.

16      Q      Okay.    Is she the smarter of the two Stefiks at the

17      house?

18      A      I guess the kids would think so.

19      Q      Okay.    Do any of these books describe your invention,

20      particularly the trusted system invention?

21      A      Yes, they do.

22      Q      Okay.    And in general, how do they do that?

23      A      Well, certainly the Internet Dreams book is a book

24      which describes it really for a -- if you will, a lay

25      audience, not necessarily a highly technical audience,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 82 of 127 PageID #: 6925082



1      because I was interested in evangelizing or promoting the

2      ideas of trusted systems at that time.

3      Q      Are some of these other books aimed at more of a

4      technical nature than, say, the Internet Dreams book?

5      A      Well, certainly Knowledge System is a textbook, and

6      Internet Edge is somewhat more technical than Internet

7      Dreams.

8      Q.     Tell us, if you can, about what sort of projects and --

9      and artificial intelligence you are working on now at Xerox.

10      A.     Well, probably my main project is a project called

11      CitySight.      This is a project I'm doing with Xerox, the

12      larger corporation.         And it's with the Los Angeles

13      Department of Transportation and a similar organization in

14      Denver and some other cities.

15             I'm working with police departments and traffic control

16      organizations and so on to help them with artificial

17      intelligence to have more effective teams for managing the

18      police forces, managing traffic control, things like that.

19      Q.     Now, I wanted to introduce you Monday to the jury

20      panel, but you weren't here.            Where were you?

21      A.     Yes, sir.     I was actually in Washington.            I was meeting

22      with the Defense Department.            They've become interested in

23      my assistance for the CitySight product, and they're

24      interested in how that could be used or a version of it

25      could be used by the military for assisting soldiers who
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 83 of 127 PageID #: 6925183



1      could be out in the field, possibly cut off from others

2      and -- and help them make better more effective decisions as

3      a team.

4      Q.     So that'd be combining, say, artificial intelligence

5      with strike forces or things of that ilk?

6      A.     That's correct, sir.

7      Q.     Okay.    Now, tell me, when did you begin your research

8      that resulted in the trusted system invention, Dr. Stefik?

9      A.     In 1993.

10      Q.     And what caused you to start doing that?               Because

11      that's not artificial intelligence.

12      A.     Indeed, that's correct.

13             So I -- I was just finishing writing that Knowledge

14      Systems textbook on artificial intelligence, and I was

15      looking for the next big thing to do, a similar challenging

16      project.

17      Q.     Well, is that something that you can do if you're

18      working at -- at the Xerox research labs, just start looking

19      around for something to do?

20      A.     If you're a research fellow, sir, they give you a lot

21      of rope, and they expect you to come up with important

22      things.

23      Q.     And what did you decide the next big project was?

24      A.     Well, I decided to look at this problem of the

25      Internet.      It was getting pretty exciting then because it
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 84 of 127 PageID #: 6925284



1      was coming open.        It was going to be a big thing.

2             And I became aware that people who are creative, who

3      wrote music and made movies and so on would see the Internet

4      as a fabulous place for getting their works out there so

5      that people could use them.

6             It was also a very dangerous place because, if you put

7      movies in the form of digital things on the Internet, they

8      would potentially be copied, and they might not be able to

9      make a living that way.

10      Q.     Well, how does somebody copy something off the

11      Internet?

12      A.     Well, sir, when you're -- when you're on the Internet,

13      everything is digital.          That's part of what makes the

14      Internet different from the regular world.                 In the regular

15      world, everything is physical.             In the Internet and

16      computer, it's digital, means all bits.                There's really no

17      substance.      It's not solid.

18      Q.     Can I -- can I ask you what digital content is?

19      A.     Yes, sir.

20      Q.     What is it?

21      A.     So if you have a book, in the old days -- and this

22      isn't quite a book, but it's paper.              But there's a -- it's

23      not digital.       I mean, this is paper.          It's physical.

24             A digital book means it's represented in bits inside

25      computers.      Same thing for a movie.          It's not a film anymore
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 85 of 127 PageID #: 6925385



1      or a tape.      It's bits inside the computer.

2      Q.     And what is a bit?

3      A.     A bit is a unit of storage.           It's a tiny unit of

4      memory, and it's something that can be communicated over

5      wires, stored on the computer memories.                It has no mass.

6      There's essentially no substance to it.                It's not like this

7      physical world.        It's bits and -- and the rules are

8      different for that, sir.

9      Q.     And how are the bits represented?             Is there a way that

10      they're represented?

11      A.     Well, I mean, technically, down at the bottom level,

12      bits are energy states of electrons.               There's almost --

13      there's almost no -- there's no substance essentially to

14      what they are.

15             But they are -- but they're important for everything

16      that's on your computer because everything that's a movie or

17      a document or a book or a piece of music always is

18      represented inside bits.

19             And the job of the computer is to take those bits and

20      make them be -- to render them, as they say, into things

21      that we can perceive as people.

22      Q.     Earlier, in the opening, I put up a -- a world map that

23      looked like this.        So tell me what the problem with the

24      Internet is and if you've got digital content on the

25      Internet.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 86 of 127 PageID #: 6925486



1      A.     Yes, sir.

2             Well, this is a picture of the world.               As we can see,

3      0s and 1s are a popular representation of what bits are.

4      And you see the different cities that are lit up there and

5      connected by these arcs and so on.              If you think of the

6      Internet as being made up of computers and connections

7      between them, that's -- that's a pretty good view of what's

8      there.

9                    And what was happening in 1993 was this was

10      getting to be a very rich place.             Instead of there being a

11      few academic computers or military computers, there were

12      going to be millions of computers out there.

13                    And that was -- think of that as a way to

14      distribute movies.         It would mean that anytime, anywhere, if

15      you could get your -- a movie on your computer, you could

16      watch it.

17                    And publishers could see this and -- and

18      creators -- creative people who make movies or write books

19      and make a living by doing so would look at this and say:

20      This is a really terrific way we could reach our customers,

21      because anybody could go in their computer and -- and -- and

22      read the book or see the movie any time they wanted to.

23                    But there was a big danger there because these

24      bits, as I said, they have no substance.                You can't grab on

25      to them.      If you see a -- a car and a movie, you can't touch
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 87 of 127 PageID #: 6925587



1      that car.      It's just bits out there which are made to look

2      like that for people.

3                    It's all what the computers do to handle these

4      bits and make them appear like things and move them around.

5      It's all -- all done by computers.

6                    So the publishers were worried, because if they

7      put their movies or books on to those digital things, they

8      might get away.

9      Q.     How -- how do they get away now?             Let's suppose it's

10      out there on the Internet, and let's suppose I've made a

11      movie called Marshall, Texas, Marshall, Texas, and I've

12      produced it, and I paid for it, and I got people to act in

13      it, and I put it out on the Internet.

14      A.     If you put this out on the Internet in 1993, then it

15      would travel to my computer, say, because I'm buying this

16      movie.     I want to find out about Marshall -- Marshall,

17      Texas, and I can just take that movie, and I could say:                        Oh,

18      this is a cool movie.

19             It's in a file or something somewhere in my commuter,

20      and I could just send that to my friends.                And that's how it

21      gets away, sir, because I click the mouse button, and it

22      goes away.

23                    It's different from a book because a book -- you

24      have to go to a copier, one page at a time and make the

25      copy, or if it's a movie -- and at that time, it was a VHS
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 88 of 127 PageID #: 6925688



1      tape -- you have to get two machines and line them up, and

2      then you've got to go to the UPS and ship it off.

3                      And the Internet, with your computer, a click of

4      the mouse, you could send it to hundreds of people, so it

5      was a great distribution mechanism, but it was very

6      dangerous if you were a publisher or creator.

7      Q.      Kind of prior to this time, Dr. Stefik, if I had a

8      book -- suppose I had a book called Marshall, Texas,

9      Marshall, Texas.        I could copy the book, couldn't I?

10      A.      Yes, you could, sir.

11      Q.      Well, how would I copy it, physically copy it?

12      A.      Well, I suppose you could go to a Xerox machine and you

13      could open the book to the first page and hit the green

14      button.

15      Q.      I notice you said Xerox.

16      A.      I pitch for it.      Sorry.

17      Q.      Okay.

18      A.      And go to -- go to -- go to Page 2 and copy that as

19      well.     And by the time you got done, maybe you'd bind it

20      together and go to the post office or something and ship it

21      off.     It will take you a lot of work to make a copy of that

22      book.     It's kind of a natural cost in making a book.

23      Q.      Is that much different from the copying on the

24      Internet?

25      A.      On the Internet, you don't have to open the book.                 You
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 89 of 127 PageID #: 6925789



1      just go to your mouse and file and a couple of clicks of

2      your mouse button, out it goes.             And somebody's got it.             You

3      could send it to hundreds of people.

4             So it's very easy, no inhibitions, no cost of copying,

5      and you could distribute Marshall, Texas, Marshall, Texas.

6      You and your friends, if your friends got the copy, and they

7      sent it out, it would be all over the Internet, and nobody

8      would be paying for it, and your movie company would be in

9      trouble.

10      Q.     Well, when you started looking at this problem,

11      Dr. Stefik, had anybody solved it?

12      A.     No, sir.

13      Q.     Well, it -- it --

14      A.     At least --at least -- what I would say is there were

15      things I would call solutions, but I wouldn't call them good

16      solutions.

17      Q.     Okay.     Were there people out there saying that it was

18      impossible to solve?

19      A.     Yes, there were, sir.

20      Q.     Okay.

21                     MR. BAXTER:     Let me see Slide 5.

22      Q.     (By Mr. Baxter) Do you know who Mr. Barlow is?                 I've

23      had this up a couple of times.             Do you know who he is?

24      A.     I do.     He's a -- it says co-founder of the Electronic

25      Frontier Foundation.         He's a very vocal leading person
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 90 of 127 PageID #: 6925890



1      relative to what's going on in technology, especially on --

2      on the Internet.

3      Q.     Do you -- do you know him?

4      A.     I've interacted with him in debates before, sir.                  I do

5      not know him well, personally.

6      Q.     All right.      Now, I think -- he -- he said:            We're

7      sailing in the future on a sinking ship.                Have you debated

8      him about that?

9      A.     I debated him on that in The Atlantic magazine

10      roundtable, and I did, yes, sir.

11      Q.     Okay.    Did he finally come around and think the ship

12      might float or not?

13      A.     Well, it's interesting.          I -- I really want -- yes, he

14      did.    The answer to your question is, yes, he did.

15      Q.     Okay.    Now, when you set out to work on this next big

16      problem, what did you hope to accomplish, Dr. Stefik?

17      A.     Well, sir, there were two things I wanted to do.                  The

18      first thing, in the interest of the artists and the

19      creators, is I wanted to have a way to make the Internet and

20      computers safe for publishers so that they could use it as a

21      great mark -- marketing method and distribution channel.

22                     And the second thing, sir, that I wanted to do was

23      to let consumers enjoy this so that they could -- they could

24      get their movies or -- or music anytime, make it very

25      convenient.      It would be safe for them, and they could enjoy

1      all these wonderful things that people created.

2      Q.     Was there a balancing between the movie producers and

3      the consumers?       Was that an issue for you?

4      A.     Well, I've talked about lots of issues that might be

5      inside that, sir, but the key part of the invention was, in

6      fact, to make it secure.           Because if the publishers felt

7      safe in publishing their works, then they would put their

8      works out there.

9             And if the works were out there, the consumers would be

10      able to buy their movies and books, so it's kind of -- more

11      of a win/win solution, sir, than -- than a balancing act.

12      Q.     Are you familiar with the term "smartphone" and

13      "tablets"?

14      A.     Yes, sir.

15      Q.     And were you familiar with them back in 1993 and '94?

16      A.     Well, they didn't exist in 1993, sir.

17      Q.     Well --

18      A.     I could see them coming, but they didn't exist yet.

19      Q.     Okay.     Well, did -- did -- did Xerox PARC have anything

20      to do with, say, tablets in those days?

21      A.     Well, yes, sir.       I mean, one of the reasons I went to

22      work for PARC was because it was filled with like --

23      like-minded people, all of whom were interested in creating

24      the future.      And we had those things in the laboratories at

25      that time.

1                    MR. BAXTER:      Can I see Slide 6?

2      Q.      (By Mr. Baxter) Are these some of the -- of the tablets

3      and inventions that you -- that you had at PARC in those

4      days?

5      A.      Yes, sir, they are.

6      Q.      All right.     Tell the jury about these.

7      A.      Well, the two at the bottom are probably the most

8      relevant.      On the left is one that was called a PARC tab,

9      and that was a little device.            It's about the size of a

10      phone that you could interact with.

11              It's a lot like Treos and other things that were sort

12      of predecessors of what are smartphones today.                  You could

13      email on it.       You could send texts around, take notes,

14      things like that.

15              The one on the right, which I had a lot more

16      interactions about, we called a PARC tab, and it's

17      essential -- excuse me -- it was essentially a tablet

18      computer as -- both of these things really are computers.

19      They're mobile computing devices, which is important for

20      understanding what could be done here.

21              And so that's kind of a predecessor, I would say, of

22      the iPad and other kinds of tablet computers.

23      Q.      How far in advance of the tablets were these?                How far

24      in advance of the times were these devices?

25      A.      Well, these are from the early '90s.             So more than
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 93 of 127 PageID #: 6926193



1      10 years, maybe 15 years, something like that.

2      Q.     And -- and what -- and could -- could people at Xerox

3      PARC -- and you see these coming down the road?

4      A.     Well, we were using these things, sir, so it was not

5      hard for us -- we were in a very privileged position to see

6      that this was coming because we were already using them.

7      Q.     What about smartphones?

8      A.     We did not have smartphones, sir.

9      Q.     Could you see them coming down the road?

10      A.     Well, the essential -- the answer is yes, but -- and

11      the reason I'm saying that is because a smartphone is

12      essentially a computer.          The key thing here is that these

13      are portable computers which are capable of doing the things

14      that matter for this invention.

15      Q.     I want to turn to the -- if I can now, Dr. Stefik, to

16      see if anybody -- if you were the only one looking at how to

17      solve this -- this problem?

18      A.     Other people were working on it, sir.

19      Q.     Other people?

20      A.     Yes.

21      Q.     Other smart people?

22      A.     Indeed.

23      Q.     Had others proposed a solution by this time?

24      A.     People had proposed solutions.            I didn't think that

25      they were good solutions, but other solutions were being
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 94 of 127 PageID #: 6926294



1      proposed.

2      Q.     Can you give us an example of a proposed solution?

3      A.     Well, one that's come up already here is encryption or

4      sometimes what we'll refer to -- things called a secure

5      container, and that's an example, sir.

6      Q.     Can you tell us what encryption is, please, Dr. Stefik?

7      A.     Yes.    I don't know if people here are familiar with

8      decoder rings.       Sort of the idea that you can have secret

9      codes, and it will read -- and read the code.

10             So encryption is something which takes some digital

11      object -- so it could be a digital version of a movie or a

12      book or really anything, and you run it through the code,

13      and then someone who doesn't have the code or the secret key

14      of that code can't make sense of it.

15             So encryption is something which takes something and

16      turns it into this code.           And then the other half of this --

17      and there's different kinds of encryption -- will decode

18      that so now you can see it as a movie or a book again.

19             So when it's coded or encrypted, nobody could

20      understand it without having the secret key.

21      Q.     Do -- do you understand the term "secure container"?

22      A.     Yes, sir.

23      Q.     Were you familiar with the secure container approach

24      back when you started working on this problem?

25      A.     I was familiar with a secure container approach, sir,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 95 of 127 PageID #: 6926395



1      yes.

2      Q.      Can you tell the jury what that is?

3      A.      Well, I understand the secure container approach to be

4      one where you take some digital content, and -- like a

5      digital movie or book or whatever it is you want, and if

6      you're going to send it, let's say, from a store to another

7      device, let's say a computer or a smartphone or something

8      like that, that you would encrypt it first, and then a

9      person at the other end must have the work and a key to

10      unlock it at the other end.            And a secure container approach

11      ships it across a wire to the other side.

12              And to use it then, you must have a key to -- to do

13      that.

14      Q.      Well, once you decrypt it on the other side, what

15      happens?

16      A.      Well, then you can use it any way you want to, sir, if

17      that's all you have is -- is a secure container approach.

18      And the problem is, as we talked about in the patent, that

19      you're now relying on trust of the person if there is no

20      other security feature to not use this in some other way.

21      So if it's decrypted, you do that.

22      Q.      All right, sir.      Do you -- did you believe that just

23      having a secure container approach was going to solve the

24      problem for movie producers and book publishers?

25      A.      I didn't believe so, sir.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 96 of 127 PageID #: 6926496



1      Q.     All right, sir.       And why not?

2      A.     Because if you just had that secure container approach,

3      as -- as I just described it, then the person on the other

4      end could then just make copies of it or do anything else.

5             So, for example, let's say that you wanted to rent a

6      movie.     Well, if it was just secure container, then once it

7      was decrypted, there would be no regulations.                 It wouldn't

8      say anything else like you have to play it soon or you have

9      24 hours to play it or anything else like that, sir.

10             So it would be incomplete.           It would not maintain

11      protection like the publishers needed.               You couldn't trust

12      the computer to maintain this protection.                It wouldn't be

13      safe for the publishers.

14                    MR. BAXTER:      I'm reminded, Your Honor, by folks

15      that are smarter than I that I didn't put the PX number of

16      these slides in.        I wonder if I could backtrack just a

17      second and do that?

18                    THE COURT:     Well, you can.        Of course, we're going

19      to recite those in the morning as a part of the record, but

20      I won't -- I won't preclude you from doing it now if you

21      think you need to.

22                    MR. BAXTER:      I'd rather not.       If we're going to do

23      it in the morning, Your Honor, I --

24                    THE COURT:     That's why we have that morning

25      session before the jury comes in.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 97 of 127 PageID #: 6926597



1                     MR. BAXTER:     You're a lot -- you're smarter than I

2      am, Your Honor.        Let me just forego that, if I can.

3                     THE COURT:    All right.

4                     MR. BAXTER:     Thank you.

5      Q.     (By Mr. Baxter) All right.           Well, Dr. Stefik, you

6      were -- were you here for the opening?

7      A.     No, sir, I was not.

8      Q.     You weren't?

9             Well, let me --

10      A.     Opening this morning?

11      Q.     Opening this morning.

12      A.     Yes, sir, I was.

13      Q.     Okay.     Did you hear about that patent that said --

14      Well, there's going to be a patent in this case in which

15      everybody already knew about trusted systems and secure

16      containers?

17      A.     Yes, sir.

18      Q.     Did you hear about that?

19      A.     Yes.

20                     MR. BAXTER:     Do you have that patent available,

21      Mr. Diaz?       I've forgotten the number, but -- there is it is.

22      Q.     (By Mr. Baxter) I'm going to show you this part --

23                     MR. BAXTER:     Blow up that part right there,

24      Mr. Diaz.

25      Q.     (By Mr. Baxter) I'm going to show you the part that
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 98 of 127 PageID #: 6926698



1      indicates that people already knew about the two schemes and

2      see if you agree with this.            Two basic DRM schemes have been

3      employed, secure containers and trusted systems.                  Do you

4      agree with that?

5      A.     I was the -- helped write the specifications for these

6      patents, sir, so I better agree with it.

7      Q.     A secure container are simply an encrypted document,

8      offers a way to keep the document's contents encrypted until

9      a set of authorization conditions are met.                 And I believe

10      Counsel showed that to the jury this morning.                 And -- and do

11      you agree with that?

12      A.     It does -- it does keep -- yes, yes, sir, I do.

13      Q.     And do you agree that there are two basic schemes?                      One

14      is a secure container, and the other is the basic trusted

15      system?

16      A.     I agree what it says here, sir, yes.

17      Q.     Okay.    Do you also agree later on, the part he didn't

18      read, says:      Clearly, the secure container approach provides

19      a solution to protecting the document during delivery over

20      insecure channels?

21             Do you agree with that?

22      A.     Yes, sir, I do.       I believe it's -- it is a form of --

23      it uses encryption to do that.

24      Q.     But does not provide any mechanism to prevent

25      legitimate users from obtaining the clear document.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 99 of 127 PageID #: 6926799



1              And "clear" means unencrypted; is that right?

2      A.      That's correct.

3      Q.      From then using and redistributing it in violation of

4      content owners' intellectual property.

5              Do you agree with that?

6      A.      Yes.

7      Q.      And -- and why was that important?

8      A       Remember, the problem was that the Internet wasn't safe

9      for publishers.        If we didn't make it safe for publishers,

10      they wouldn't put their movies or their music or their books

11      on to the Internet.           And consumers wouldn't be able to get

12      their movies and play them anytime, and the rights that the

13      publishers wanted to have enforced wouldn't be enforced by

14      those computers.

15      Q       All right, sir.       Well, what solution did you come up

16      with?

17      A       Well, sir, I believe we made a slide for this.

18      Q       Okay.

19                      MR. BAXTER:    Mr. Diaz, do you have Slide 7?

20      Q       (By Mr. Baxter) Tell the jury what you came up with.

21      A       Well, this is a -- this slide shows the two main

22      elements of the invention, sir.             On the one part of it is

23      that there are usage rights.            That means those are the

24      things that the publisher wants to have enforced to consider

25      it safe.

                                                                                 100



1       Q      Okay.    Now, those appear to be on the left over there.

2       Can you --

3       A      Yes, sir.

4       Q      -- explain?

5              This has to do with movie rental rules.              Tell the jury

6       what those are.

7       A      Well, this is a good example of a kind of a right that

8       a publisher might like to see enforced.               He's saying you can

9       play it, so playing is a kind of a thing you can do.                   And

10      your rental is good for 30 days, sort of like if you went to

11      a -- you know, a -- in the old days a Blockbuster -- they're

12      not around anymore -- but you had to return it or pay a late

13      fee.

14      Q      Well, now, wait a minute.          Whose fault is it that

15      they're not around anymore?

16      A      Well, this has taken over the market, sir.               It's --

17      digital distribution is so much more convenient that the

18      convenience has put them out of the way.

19      Q      It's your fault?

20      A      It's the fault of the digital world, sir.               And what's

21      possible, they've been disrupted, as we say in the

22      technology business.

23      Q      All right.

24      A      Well, if I finish about the rights, it says you can

25      play it.       You've got 30 days to do it.         And once you start

                                                                                 101



1       to play it, you've got 24 hours to finish it.                 It's kind of

2       a typical sort of arrangement for renting a movie.                  That's

3       the rights.

4       Q     Could there be other rights as well as just these?

5       A     Well, certainly, sir.          For example, you might be able

6       to play it, but perhaps you could play a high definition

7       version of it or -- or just the regular version.

8       Q     What about --

9       A     You could buy it.

10      Q     What about copying it?

11      A     Well, that would be a different right, sir.

12      Q     Well, could it be -- you can't copy it?

13      A     Well, if you don't --

14      Q     Well --

15                   THE COURT:      Gentlemen, let's make sure that we do

16      it one at a time.        Make sure that the question is finished

17      before you answer, and make sure the answer is finished

18      before you ask the next question.

19                   MR. BAXTER:      My fault, Your Honor.         Excuse me.

20                   THE COURT:      Let's continue.

21                   THE WITNESS:      Yes, sir.

22      A     When I wrote the invention, I considered copying to be

23      kind of a right.       And if you didn't have that right, you

24      couldn't copy it.        That was a promise.        That was why the

25      computer would be trusted.

                                                                                 102



1       Q       (By Mr. Baxter) All right, sir.

2       A       Now, the right-hand side is the repository.

3               Now, in this case we're showing that this a mobile

4       computer like those ones at Xerox PARC I was talking about.

5       And it has a couple of parts to it, but the main job of this

6       thing is to honor the request of the publishers to

7       enforce -- by enforcing those usage rights.

8               And in doing that, if it enforces those, the publishers

9       feel safe.        They could put the movies or books or whatever

10      on the Internet.        And the consumer benefits because they

11      could play that movie or read that book anytime, anywhere.

12      Q       Where do the usage rights come from, Dr. Stefik?

13      A       Well, the usage rights are something established by the

14      publishers, sir.        The publishers says:        These are -- these

15      are the rules I want to have in place for distributing my

16      work.

17              And I -- it's the same sort of thing as would be done

18      at Blockbuster.        In this case it's being done by a computer.

19      It's the enforcement of the computer of those rights, which

20      is important.        It's what made the Internet safe.

21      Q       Okay.

22                      MR. BAXTER:   Let me see Slide 8 for me, if I

23      could, Mr. Diaz.

24      Q       (By Mr. Baxter) And we have usage rights on the left.

25      What's on the right here, Dr. Stefik?
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 103 of 127 PageID #: 69271
                                                                                 103



1       A     Well, sir, on the right -- the left, as you say, is the

2       usage right, that same one we talked about for renting the

3       movie.     On the right is the Court's claim construction for

4       what it means to be a usage right.

5       Q     Okay.     And these -- and I think the Judge has said

6       these are in the juror notebooks, right?

7       A     I believe that's true, sir.

8       Q     Okay.     And these usage rights you said came from where?

9       A     The publisher established these rights, sir.

10      Q     Okay.

11      A     Or the creator, the artists, whoever is turning loose

12      of that digital content.

13      Q     And are those usage rights -- where do they end up?

14      A     Well, they have to end up on the computer because, I

15      mean, in a way, sir, computers could be said to be the

16      problem.      Like if it wasn't for computers, these things

17      couldn't get away.

18            This invention is making the computer be part of the

19      solution by having that trusted system take charge and make

20      sure that those rights are enforced.

21                    MR. BAXTER:     Let me see Slide 9, Mr. Diaz.

22      Q     (By Mr. Baxter) This is really the slide that we looked

23      at before, and so now I want to get you on the right-hand

24      side, Dr. Stefik.        And you've labeled this what?

25      A     I call this a trusted repository.             I know that's a
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 104 of 127 PageID #: 69272
                                                                                 104



1       million-dollar word.

2       Q       Now, why do you -- why did you call it a repository?

3       A       Well, a repository -- I don't know what about me used

4       that word, but it's a place where you can store things, sir.

5       And it's -- I want it to be trusted so that it would honor

6       those rights and that it would use software to do so.

7       Q       All right, sir.      And the software, where does it come

8       from?

9       A       Well, the software has to be trusted, sir, as part of

10      the solution and that software has to come from the

11      people -- often who make the device.              It doesn't often have

12      to come that way, but it's written by the people who create

13      this trusted repository.

14      Q       It also has another element I see at the bottom.                Tell

15      the jury what that is.

16      A       Well, this is the integrity, sir.           I know it isn't

17      normally plural, and I apologize for my creative use of

18      language, sir.

19      Q       Now, we've got a gavel down there.            Does your -- does

20      the integrities actually have a gavel?

21      A       Well, integrities is supposed -- supposed to have that

22      it has integrity, just as this Court has integrity for its

23      processes.      And the integrities refer to ways that --

24      properties that this trusted repository must have in order

25      to keep things safe.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 105 of 127 PageID #: 69273
                                                                                 105



1       Q     How many integrities are there?

2       A     Well, there's three kinds of integrities, sir, that I

3       talked about in the invention.

4                     MR. BAXTER:     Can we see Slide 10, Mr. Diaz?

5       Q     (By Mr. Baxter) Can you tell the jury what they are?

6       A     Well, in broad terms, there's three kinds of

7       integrities, sir.        There's the physical ones, and those have

8       to do with any kind of the way of getting at the device

9       itself, if you could pry over the cover or something like

10      that, and it says here that no matter what you do, there's

11      going to be some defense against getting at the content by

12      anything but a trusted system itself.

13      Q     Okay.

14      A     That's the physical parking lot.             Then

15      communications -- these devices have to get these movies and

16      books from somewhere.         They have to communicate.           And so the

17      communications integrity has to do with things to make that

18      communication be safe.

19            And the behavior one, the last one, says:                We're

20      counting on this computer to do the right thing.                  It had

21      better behave.       It's why it's called behavioral.             And so

22      this is -- means we want to make sure that that software

23      came from a place that we can trust.

24            And so that's -- so the software will do the right

25      thing and enforce the rights and all that, and that's why
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 106 of 127 PageID #: 69274
                                                                                 106



1       it's called behavioral integrity.

2       Q     Can you tell the jury what a digital certificate is?

3       A     Sir, a digital certificate is a -- part of a security

4       procedure for understanding where something came from.                    It's

5       based in a way too complicated to go into probably on -- on

6       the same coding ideas and things like that.

7             But what it means really is, if the -- the certificate

8       says where something came from.            So let's say I really

9       trusted you, sir, and I got something in the mail that says,

10      you know, something important to me, and do I believe it?

11      Well, I say this came from Sam Baxter.              Okay.     Anything from

12      Sam Baxter I'm going to believe.            That's the idea.

13            And so a digital certificate is a very secure way for a

14      computer to know where something came from.                 And in this

15      case, it's about knowing where the programming, the

16      enforcement software came from so that we know it's going to

17      do the right thing, came from a -- came from a good place.

18      Q     Are those the three integrities?

19      A     Yes, sir.

20      Q     Physical integrity has to do really with a mobile

21      device?

22      A     With any device, yes, sir, the device itself.

23      Q     And the communications integrity has to do with what?

24      A     The communications line between them, sir, so we --

25      think of this being like a phone.             Let me pretend I'm a
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 107 of 127 PageID #: 69275
                                                                                 107



1       computer for a second, and I have to use the phone to talk

2       to somebody.

3             Well, a phone is an open line.            I mean, if somebody

4       listening in on the line, they might hear something I said.

5       Well, if it was supposed to be secret, they would be

6       listening on the phone.          Or maybe somebody is masquerading

7       to be somebody else, and I don't really know who I'm talking

8       to.

9             So the communications integrity is the technology that

10      keeps the information safe and lets me be sure who I'm

11      talking to, things like that.

12      Q     And the behavioral integrity?

13      A     Behavioral integrity, as we talked about, sir, is

14      making sure that the software -- the enforcement software on

15      the trusted repository, the smartphone or whatever it is,

16      is -- is correct.        It came from a respected and trustworthy

17      source, so I know it's going to do the right thing.

18                   MR. BAXTER:      May I see Slide 11, Mr. Diaz?

19      Q     (By Mr. Baxter) Can you give us an example, Dr. Stefik,

20      from your patent where you teach that the trusted repository

21      has the responsibility to enforce the usage rights?

22      A     Yes, sir.      This is quoted out of the patent.             So we see

23      the enforcement software there, which is supposed to always

24      enforce the usage right, and the patent teaches here -- it

25      says there at the bottom where in patent it is.                 It's the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 108 of 127 PageID #: 69276
                                                                                 108



1       '859 patent.

2               It says that the enforcement elements -- that is, how

3       does the repository work -- the enforcement elements are

4       embodied in the repositories.            So it says the repository is

5       what enforces the rights.

6       Q       Why did you include enforcement rights as part of your

7       invention or usage rights as part of your invention?

8       A       Well, I had to include usage rights, sir, because the

9       computer had to know what it was the publisher wanted to

10      have done, what rules had to be in place for them to feel

11      safe.     So the usage rights had to be there somehow, sir.

12      Q       Do we have an example from the patent --

13                      MR. BAXTER:   If I could see Slide 12.

14      Q       (By Mr. Baxter) -- that shows how the enforcement of

15      the usage rights works?

16      A       Yes.     So these are figures -- this a figure from the

17      patent.

18      Q       Figures -- what figure is it?

19      A       It's Figure 14, sir.

20      Q       Okay.

21      A       So on the left, we still see the trusted repository.

22      And inside on the far 0at the right there, we see usage

23      rights, the same idea we've been talking about, where you

24      can play a movie for 30 days, anytime in 30 days and so on.

25              Now, anytime someone uses one of these trusted
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 109 of 127 PageID #: 69277
                                                                                 109



1       repositories, you know, like the smartphone or one of these

2       tablets from -- that I've talked about here, he asks -- he

3       or she asks to, let's say, play that movie, the repositories

4       can say:     Oh, I've just received a request to play the

5       movie.     I'm going to run a certain transaction.

6             This Figure 14 says:         For every right, there's a kind

7       of transaction.       And it says here that -- and I call this

8       transactional component.          It's part of the enforcement

9       software.

10            So this says the transactional component, that's the

11      enforcement software, is embodied in software instructions

12      in the repository.        And they're the ones that implement the

13      privileges for the rights, how they can use it, how they can

14      distribute it and so on.

15                   MR. BAXTER:      Let me see Slide 13, if we could.

16      Q     (By Mr. Baxter) Do your patents have -- do they further

17      describe how the enforcement software works?                And I know

18      you've prepared this slide --

19      A     Yes, sir.

20      Q     -- in anticipation of that.           Tell us -- tell us what

21      this shows.

22      A     Well, this is showing why it is that the repository

23      always enforces the rights, and it will always do this,

24      because the publisher wants to be always safe, not just when

25      the computer feels like it or a certain time of day or
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 110 of 127 PageID #: 69278
                                                                                 110



1       something.      It has to always do it.

2             And what this does is that whenever -- when a user

3       requests -- every time a user requests access to a digital

4       work, the repository, that means the enforcement software in

5       this case will initiate various transactions.                 Just like in

6       that figure we just looked at.

7             So in the bottom paragraph there, the server -- that's

8       the computer part of this -- checks whether the digital work

9       has been granted the right.

10            So first it starts with the work, like the movie

11      someone might want to see.           It says:     Does it have the

12      right?    And if it does, it says:          Let's run the transaction,

13      which will then be responsible for enforcing that right.

14            So this is -- the point is that the rules in the

15      digital world are enforced by software.               That's what makes

16      it so different from the physical world.               We're counting on

17      these computers to do the job.

18            And this teaching in the patent is trying to show how

19      it is that the enforcement software -- the programs, instead

20      of the computer, are what make the rules, and that's what

21      this is teaching, sir.

22      Q     All right.

23                   MR. BAXTER:      Let's look at the next slide, if you

24      would, Mr. Diaz.

25      Q     (By Mr. Baxter) Dr. Stefik, can you explain how the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 111 of 127 PageID #: 69279
                                                                                 111



1       enforcement software in a trusted repository fits into the

2       Court's construction of usage rights, which is on the right

3       right over here?

4       A     Well, sir, this slide is talking about usage rights.

5       And the table there is a piece of the Court's claim

6       construction on how -- how we are to understand them.

7             And the usage rights for the same things I'm talking

8       about how -- what is it that the computer is supposed to do?

9       The publisher has said, you know, play the movie.

10            If you want to play the movie, you can do it anytime

11      within the next 30 days.          After you've rented it, you've got

12      24 hours.     That is the rule.        And this is where the Court's

13      claim construction explains usage rights, sir.

14      Q     Did you, in your patent, require that the usage rights

15      and the content always travel together.

16      A     The patent does not say that that is required, sir, no,

17      I did not require it.

18      Q     All right.      Are there different ways that the usage

19      rights and the content can travel?

20      A     Yes, sir, there are.

21      Q     Tell the jury what those are.

22      A     Well, I think we have a slide --

23                   MR. BAXTER:      Let me see Slide 15, if we can,

24      Mr. Diaz.

25      A     So these are two examples of how the work and the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 112 of 127 PageID #: 69280
                                                                                 112



1       rights could get to the trusted repository.                So in the top

2       part, it says you see the movie Antarctica, and those rights

3       again, and those are traveling at the same time, I guess, or

4       maybe at different times even from location A so that they

5       get into the trusted repository.

6               And they have to both be in the trusted repository,

7       sir, in order to -- for it to be able to enforce those

8       rights.

9               But the other way they could get there, they could come

10      at different times; they could come from different places.

11      And what really matters for the trusted repository is that

12      when someone wants to ask to play the movie, they're both

13      there.     So the repository doesn't necessarily care whether

14      they got there at the same time or different channels.

15              In fact, if you think about the Internet itself, sir,

16      nothing really stays together.            If you send anything, a

17      book, a page, an email, it's broken up into little pieces,

18      sir.     They're called packets.

19              And -- but the digital world is just different.                And it

20      says:     How do I send this packet?          Sends it out there.        This

21      packet -- I'm sending it to you.            This one might go to

22      Florida and bounce around a little bit and get to you.                   The

23      next piece of the movie or the book might go someplace else.

24              These things don't stay together.           We think about it as

25      staying together, but in the digital world, things don't act

                                                                                 113



1       the same way as they do in the physical world.                 They always

2       pick the best route in the case of Internet.                It's

3       fundamental to the way the Internet itself works.

4             So it's not required, sir.           It's kind of a long answer

5       to your question, but it's not required that they travel

6       together at the same time from the same place.

7       Q     (By Mr. Baxter) And does your patent require them to

8       always travel together or be together?

9       A     The patent does not require that, sir.

10      Q     Okay.     Where does -- eventually, do they end up?

11      A     They have to end up into the trusted repository so that

12      it can enforce the usage rights.

13      Q     And do both of them have to be there?               Clearly, does

14      the content have to be there in order for it to work?

15      A     Can't see a movie if you don't have the movie, sir.

16      Q     Okay.     Do the usage rights also have to be there along

17      with the content?

18      A     If this is going to be a trusted repository, sir, the

19      repository has to verify that the person asking for the

20      rights has those rights.          So, yes, the rights have to be

21      there, the usage rights have to be there and the content

22      have to be there both.

23                    MR. BAXTER:     Well, let's go back, if I can, then

24      to Slide 16.

25      Q     (By Mr. Baxter) Because we've talked a lot about the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 114 of 127 PageID #: 69282
                                                                                 114



1       invention, but can you sort of give us a summary for the

2       jury of the two key elements of your invention that

3       hopefully are here on Slide 16?

4       A     Yes, sir, they're here.          So the first element is the

5       usage rights.      This is what the publisher wants the --

6       the -- to be held.        These are the rights to be held.             The

7       rights while playing the movie and so on.               So one element is

8       the rights.

9             And the second element is the trusted repository, which

10      is trusted to enforce that right.             And if it doesn't, then

11      you can play that movie or read that book anytime, anywhere.

12      Q     Now, one of the things I heard during opening today,

13      Dr. Stefik, is that it was a real pain in the neck to create

14      a trusted repository.

15            Do you agree with that?

16      A     I don't know about a pain in the neck, sir, but it's --

17      it certainly -- it does take work.

18      Q     Okay.     Is it a real burden to do it?

19      A     Well, people have done this before, sir, and, you know,

20      ContentGuard has done it.          So, I mean, obviously, people

21      make an investment in doing it, but it's not an impossible

22      task, sir.

23      Q     All right, sir.        Well, when these -- when these usage

24      rights and the integrities and the enforcement software all

25      get together, what is -- what is the benefit of your

                                                                                 115



1       invention?

2       A       Well, the benefit, sir, is then that a user -- a person

3       who wants to see that movie could do it anytime, anywhere.

4       I wanted to answer a little more on your previous question,

5       sir.

6       Q       Okay.

7       A       I actually talk about this in one of my papers, sir.                  I

8       talk about this.        I say that any competent technology

9       company can do this.          My "Letting Loose the Light" paper

10      says that, sir, and that's what I believe.

11      Q       Okay, sir.     Did -- did Xerox apply for patents on your

12      work?

13      A       Yes, sir.

14      Q       And when did they do it?

15      A       This was in November of 1994.

16      Q       Did you play any role in applying for the patents?

17      A       Well, sir, I was very involved in writing what's called

18      the specifications part of the teaching, the long part of

19      the patent.

20      Q       I know the jury has these patents in their book.

21                      MR. BAXTER:   Mr. Diaz, can you just drag up any

22      patent at all?        And I want to look at just part of it.

23                      Maybe not that page.      Maybe the patent itself.

24      And go -- and go beyond -- go beyond the first page or two.

25      Go beyond the drawing.          If I could get to the spec.          There

1       we go.

2       Q     (By Mr. Baxter) Patents are sort of organized in

3       columns, are they not?

4       A     Yes, sir.

5       Q     Okay.     And this first portion you call the what?

6       A     Well, I call this the specifications.

7       Q     Okay.     Did you write most of this, Dr. Stefik?

8       A     I wrote this in conjunction with the attorney.                 The

9       language gets legal.         You can see his hand.

10      Q     Okay.     Did you -- was it a Xerox attorney?

11      A     Yes, it was, sir, a Xerox -- yes, a Xerox attorney.

12      Q     Okay.     Now, the -- the part that I believe Judge

13      Gilstrap talked to the jury about, among other things, are

14      call claims.

15            You're familiar with those?

16      A     I am, sir.

17      Q     Did you write the claims?

18      A     No, sir, I did not write the claims.

19      Q     Who wrote the claims?

20      A     The attorney wrote the claims, sir.

21      Q.    Well, how come you didn't write them?

22      A.    Sir, this is a legal task, so I'm not trained legally

23      to -- to write claims.         And so, you know, there are -- these

24      are carefully written according to legal requirements.

25      Q.    Okay.     And when you were dealing with the lawyer, did

1       you share with him the research that you've done or any

2       publications you've done or information you looked at?

3       A.    Yes, sir.      It was my responsibility to -- to do that,

4       so I shared with him things that I found are written in this

5       area already, and -- and obviously all the work that we had

6       done in developing the ideas of the invention.

7       Q.    Okay.     And did he apply for these various patents?

8       A.    Yes, sir.      That was his job.

9       Q.    Okay.     What happened after you applied for the initial

10      patent, Dr. Stefik?

11      A.    Well, at some point in time, the patents issued.

12      Q.    Okay.     Before the patent issued and between the time

13      you applied for it and the time the patent issued, what did

14      you do?

15      A.    So I -- what I did was really work to make the

16      inventions become known.

17      Q.    Okay.     Now, just so the jury will understand, even

18      though the patent hadn't issued, did you feel free to go out

19      and talk about your invention to the world?

20      A.    Yes, sir, I did, and I believe that was part of my job.

21      Q.    Okay.     And where did you do -- and where did you go and

22      what did you do?

23      A.    Well, I believe there's a slide about publishers I

24      talked to, sir.

25                    MR. BAXTER:     Let me see Slide 17.

                                                                                 118



1       Q.    (By Mr. Baxter) You're ahead of me.

2       A.    Okay.     This -- I worked with a lot of publishers over

3       several years to make it become known what these ideas were,

4       and they were very interested and concerned about this

5       because many people had tried different ways of releasing

6       their content digitally.

7             Everybody could see an opportunity inside there, and

8       they wanted to use that opportunity.              And so this was kind

9       of going out and talking and saying:              Guess what?      It is

10      going to be possible to do this, and here are the ideas.

11      Q.    And did you explain it to them?

12      A.    Yes, sir, I did.

13      Q.    How did they receive it?

14      A.    They received it with a great deal of interest, sir.

15      Q.    All right.      Did you talk to anybody else besides just

16      publishers?

17      A.    Well, we -- the business team and I also talked to

18      companies that were making devices, the computers that would

19      become the trusted repositories, to see if they could be

20      interested in it as well.

21      Q.    Did you talk to Apple?

22      A.    Well, the Xerox business team talked to Apple, although

23      I didn't personally.

24      Q.    Did you talk to some of these other folks?

25      A.    Yes, sir, I did.

1       Q.    Who did you talk to?

2       A.    I talked to IBM, for sure, and I talked with Intel.

3       Q.    All right.      Were they interested?

4       A.    Yes.     We were -- we -- we did some negotiations, and

5       I -- I partnershipped with -- with IBM for a while on

6       working on this, sir.

7       Q.    Did you sort of explain to them where you thought the

8       Internet was going and what the potential was?

9       A.    Yes, sir, I did.

10      Q.    Okay.     And did you explain about content and how you

11      could protect it?

12      A.    Yes, sir.

13                    MR. BAXTER:     Let me see the next slide, Mr. Diaz.

14      Q.    (By Mr. Baxter) What does this slide represent,

15      Dr. Stefik?      Is this one that you had at the time?

16      A.    Yes, it is.      This is a slide -- one of the slides I

17      used during that period, sir.            This slide was a way in a

18      kind of cartoon fashion showing what the world was going to

19      be like.      It was showing how you should be able to get the

20      movies and distribute them and watch them according to the

21      usage rights.

22            We showed that for books and newspapers and music and

23      all these sorts of things because everything digital -- sort

24      of digital content was something that could be done this way

25      so that people could enjoy that work anytime, anywhere, and

1       those publishers who I was showing this to would be able to

2       trust the computer to keep the work safe.

3       Q.    Did you get more interest from publishers or from the

4       movie people?

5       A.    Probably at that time from the book publishers, and

6       some of the movie people were very interested in DVDs at

7       that time when I was talking to them about DVDs and some of

8       the problems they were going to have with that.

9       Q.    Did -- did they go the digital route or the DVD route?

10      A.    Well, they went -- they were already very heavily

11      invested in DVDs and making standards and releasing DVD

12      players.      And the world was more ready, I suppose, in many

13      respects for DVDs because they, you know, use them with

14      regular televisions and things like that, and that's the

15      route they went.

16      Q.    Had the Internet fully matured by that time,

17      Dr. Stefik?

18      A.    It was not as mature at that time, sir, no.

19      Q.    What about the devices themselves?

20      A.    Well, the devices had a long ways to go, too.                 They

21      weren't as powerful.         The screens were small.          They were

22      expensive.      They certainly weren't portable and small like

23      phones and so on as we have today.

24      Q.    Okay.     How long a period of time did you go out and

25      evangelize about your invention?

1       A.      Well, I started doing that probably right after --

2       probably early '95, talking about this with publishers and

3       computer companies and so on.            And I did that through the

4       late '90s.      I started some other projects as well, but

5       that's -- I was active in this thing during that period.

6       Q.      Were you aware that at some juncture, ContentGuard was

7       formed?

8       A.      Oh, of course, sir.

9       Q.      And -- and did you have some opportunity to go with

10      ContentGuard?

11      A.      Yes, sir, I did.

12      Q.      Why didn't you go?

13      A.      Well, sir, I'm an inventor.         And I believed with

14      ContentGuard, they would be very busy with standards

15      organizations and things like that.             And I really liked the

16      broader field I could play with inside Xerox PARC and go out

17      and invent other things.          So that's -- I did what I was good

18      at, sir.

19      Q.      Did you publish anything that put your invention out

20      there to the -- to the whole world, not just in a textbook

21      or in some of your other books?

22      A.      Yes, sir.    I wrote papers about it as well.

23      Q.      All right.    What is this, Dr. Stefik?

24      A.      Well, this is an example of a paper that I wrote in

25      1997.     It's called "Trusted Systems" because as we -- as we
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 1146 Filed 03/08/16 Page 122 of 127 PageID #: 69290
                                                                                 122



1       know, a repository is discussed in the invention as a kind

2       of trusted system.

3             This was a paper invited by Scientific American, and

4       that's a sort of amateur science magazine read by a lot of

5       people, and they were doing a special issue on the promise

6       of the Internet.

7             And they'd heard about my work and called me up and

8       said, would I write for them an article explaining the

9       promise of the Internet relative to digital publishing and

10      the distribution of digital content, and I said that I

11      would.     And this is the article that -- that was -- that I

12      created.

13      Q.    Dr. Stefik, I'll -- I want to get into an area that --

14      that you kind of didn't want me to go to, but I'm going to

15      do it anyway, and that is, you received some praise over the

16      years for your invention, have you not?

17      A.    I understand that, sir.

18                   MR. BAXTER:      Let me see Slide 21.

19      Q.    (By Mr. Baxter) This is one in which you're actually

20      talking about your new work, The Internet Edge, and he says:

21      In particular, Stefik has been the father to one powerful

22      idea that is gaining prominence in the media and publishing

23      world:     The trusted system.

24                   Do you know who Bill Rosenblatt is?

25      A.    Yes, sir, I do.        I have met him.

1       Q.    And who is he?

2       A.    Well, when I met him, he was working at Times Mirror in

3       New York.      He was representing one of the publishers at that

4       time when I was starting to talk about trusted systems.

5       Q.    Okay.

6       A.    And since then, he's become kind of a spokesman in the

7       whole field.

8       Q.    All right.      And he recognized you as the father of the

9       trusted system, of the idea that got the content over the

10      Internet?

11      A.    Well, that's what he says here, sir.

12                    MR. BAXTER:     Let me see Slide 22.

13      Q.    (By Mr. Baxter) This is from Barbara Fox, who is a

14      senior software architect at Microsoft, and she calls you

15      the acknowledged Father of DRM.            Have you see that before?

16      A.    I saw that when I started working on this case, sir.

17      Q.    Okay.     And do you -- she believes that's a fair

18      characterization.        Do you think that's a fair

19      characterization?

20      A.    Well, sir, I believe that titles like that have to be

21      given by others to you, but I'm not arguing about it.

22                    MR. BAXTER:     Let me see Slide 23, if I can.

23      Q.    (By Mr. Baxter) This is from the Motorola publication

24      and their lab.       In order to securely protect digital items,

25      the content handling portion of mobile phone needs to

1       possess the features of a trusted system as defined by

2       Stefik.

3             Is that you, sir?

4       A.    That's me, sir.

5       Q.    Okay.     And the Motorola Digital Phone Division

6       published that about you?

7       A.    That's -- that's right, sir, in 2003, I guess.

8       Q.    All right, sir.        Now, this one says:        It needs to

9       possess the features of a trusted system as defined by

10      Stefik.     And what are those features, Dr. Stefik?

11      A.    Well, we have -- we have a figure for that, sir.

12      Q.    All right.

13                    MR. BAXTER:     Let me -- let me see that, Mr. Diaz,

14      Slide 24.

15      A.    So the invention has two main elements.               There has to

16      be usage rights where -- expressing what the publisher's

17      needs are, and there has to be a trusted repository.                   Again,

18      sorry for my wrong word, but that is the computer which has

19      to enforce the usage rights.

20            And if it has those and has the integrities to do it,

21      then publishers will feel safe to put their works on the

22      Internet and consumers will benefit because they can play

23      their movie or read their book anytime, anywhere.

24                    MR. BAXTER:     Let me see Slide 25.

25      Q     (By Mr. Baxter) Tell us what this is, Dr. Stefik.

                                                                                 125



1       A     Well, sir, that's the President's Award inside Xerox,

2       has my name on it, and so it's something I was awarded in --

3       it says 1998.      And so I was one of maybe 10 people that got

4       an award -- got an award that year for something.                  This is

5       one I had worked on was the inventions in this case.

6       Q     Okay.     Do they hand those out every year?

7       A     They don't actually do that, sir, no.

8       Q     All right, sir.        Proud of that one?

9       A     Reasonably so, sir, yes.

10      Q     And finally, Slide 26, this is a report, I believe,

11      Dr. Stefik, from the Patent Office, a report to Congress

12      about the Patent Office, and it's talking about digital

13      rights management and trusted computing.

14            And it says:       The conceptual underpinnings of trusted

15      computing technologies traces back to Dr. Mark -- Dr. Mark

16      Stefik's pioneering work at Xerox PARC.               In very general

17      terms, Stefik defined the trusted system can be a system

18      that can be relied on to follow certain rules.

19            Is that correct, sir?

20      A     Yes, sir.

21      Q     And did you see that when it came out?

22      A     No, sir, I didn't know about that until I was working

23      on this case.

24      Q     And they called your work pioneering.               Are you going to

25      argue with that?

1       A     I'm not arguing much today, sir.

2       Q     Okay.     Dr. Stefik, at the -- the end of the day, sir,

3       are you proud of your invention?

4       A     Yes, sir, I am.        I am delighted that publishers or

5       movie studios are putting their works out on the Internet or

6       books and so on and creators are benefiting from that and

7       that all of us can enjoy these things anytime, anywhere.                      I

8       think it's a wonderful thing.

9       Q     Thank you, Dr. Stefik.

10                    MR. BAXTER:     I pass the witness, Your Honor.

11                    THE COURT:     All right.     Before -- ladies and

12      gentlemen, before the Defendant cross-examines the witness,

13      we're going to break for lunch.            It's 11:45 now.

14                    I'm going to ask you to leave your jury notebooks

15      on the table in the jury room during the lunch hour.                   I'd

16      like to have you back assembled in the jury room by 12:45.

17      You should get a jump on the local lunch crowd by getting

18      out 15 minutes early.

19                    I remind you, again, as you would expect me to,

20      don't discuss the case with anyone, including yourselves,

21      follow my other instructions, and we'll have you back in the

22      jury room ready to go at 12:45.

23                    With that, you're excused for lunch at this time.

24                    COURT SECURITY OFFICER:         All rise for the jury.

25                    (Jury out.)
