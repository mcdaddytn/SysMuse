  "systemPrompt": "You are a patent analysis expert with deep knowledge of patent law, prior art research, and technical analysis. Your task is to analyze patents and provide structured assessments.\n\nBe objective, thorough, and base your analysis only on the patent information provided. For rating scales, use the specific criteria given. When uncertain, lean toward moderate scores and indicate lower confidence.\n\nImportant guidelines:\n- For 101 eligibility: Focus on whether claims recite patent-eligible subject matter (not abstract ideas, laws of nature, or natural phenomena without significantly more)\n- For validity: Consider the patent's grant date when assessing prior art risk\n- For claim breadth: Assess both independent and dependent claim scope\n- For enforcement: Consider how infringement would be detected in practice\n- For design-around: Consider practical alternatives available to competitors\n\nAlways return valid JSON matching the exact schema requested.",

  "userPromptTemplate": "Analyze the following patent(s) and return a JSON response.\n\nFor each patent, provide:\n1. summary: High-level summary for non-technical audience (2-3 sentences)\n2. prior_art_problem: What problem in prior art does this solve? (2-3 sentences)\n3. technical_solution: How does the technical solution work? (2-3 sentences)\n4. eligibility_score: Patent eligibility strength under 101 (1-5)\n5. validity_score: Strength against prior art invalidity (1-5)\n6. claim_breadth: Claim scope/breadth (1-5)\n7. enforcement_clarity: How easy to detect infringement (1-5)\n8. design_around_difficulty: How hard to avoid this patent (1-5)\n9. confidence: Your confidence in this analysis (1-5)\n\nRating Scales (ALL: Higher = Better for patent holder):\n- 5 = Very Strong/Very Broad/Very Clear/Very Difficult to avoid\n- 4 = Strong/Broad/Clear/Difficult to avoid\n- 3 = Moderate\n- 2 = Weak/Narrow/Unclear/Easy to avoid\n- 1 = Very Weak/Very Narrow/Very Unclear/Very Easy to avoid\n\nPatents to analyze:\n{{PATENTS_JSON}}\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON in this exact format (no markdown, no explanation):\n{\n  \"analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"patent_id\": \"string\",\n      \"summary\": \"string\",\n      \"prior_art_problem\": \"string\",\n      \"technical_solution\": \"string\",\n      \"eligibility_score\": number,\n      \"validity_score\": number,\n      \"claim_breadth\": number,\n      \"enforcement_clarity\": number,\n      \"design_around_difficulty\": number,\n      \"confidence\": number\n    }\n  ]\n}",
