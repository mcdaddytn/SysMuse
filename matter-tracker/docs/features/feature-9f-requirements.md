Feature 9f
=========

## Overview
This feature implements enhancements to the timesheet validation system, IT Activities functionality, user management, and data seeding capabilities to improve user experience and system administration.

## High Priority Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Hours Validation Warning System
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Improve the timesheet validation system to provide more informative warnings and check whether timesheet periods have expired.

**Requirements:**
- Show target hours alongside maximum hours in validation warning messages
- Differentiate between expired and current timesheet periods
- For expired periods: warn when actual hours are below target
- For current/future periods: warn when projected hours exceed target but are under maximum
- Include target hours, maximum hours, projected hours, and actual hours in warning messages

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `maxHoursPerDay` and `maxHoursPerWeek` settings integration
- Created `isWeekExpired()` function to check if timesheet period has passed
- Enhanced `hasValidationWarning()` function with detailed messaging
- Supports both daily and weekly timesheet modes

### 2. IT Activities Text Search Filter
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Add text search functionality to the IT Activities page to allow users to search within activity titles and descriptions.

**Requirements:**
- Add search input field in the IT Activities filters section
- Search should cover both title and description fields
- Implement case-insensitive search
- Include search debounce for performance
- Backend API should support text search parameter

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `textSearchFilter` reactive variable and input component
- Implemented 300ms debounce on search input
- Backend uses Prisma `contains` with `insensitive` mode
- Search uses OR condition to match either title or description

### 3. IT Activities Metadata Popup Enhancement
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Already Implemented)

**Description:**
Ensure IT Activities have mouse-over metadata popups that display structured activity information.

**Requirements:**
- Mouse-over activity titles should show metadata popup
- Metadata should be pretty-printed and well-formatted
- Support nested objects and arrays in metadata
- Include proper styling and positioning

**Implementation Details:**
- `showGridMetadataTooltip` reactive variable for hover state management
- `formatMetadataForTooltip()` function for structured formatting
- Quasar tooltip component with custom styling
- Supports complex nested metadata structures

## Medium Priority Requirements

### 4. Team Member Time Tracking Configuration
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Ensure proper time tracking configuration across team members for testing different scenarios.

**Requirements:**
- Global settings should default to hours-based time tracking
- Maintain one user with percentage-based tracking for testing
- Maintain one user with different working hours for testing
- Other users should inherit global defaults

**Implementation Details:**
- Global settings: `timeIncrementType: "HOURS_MINUTES"`, `workingHours: 40`
- Sarah Johnson, Michael Chen, Emily Rodriguez: use global defaults
- David Thompson: 45 working hours override, HOURS_MINUTES
- Jessica Williams: percentage mode override for testing

### 5. Password Reset Screen
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Create an administrative password reset interface for demo and testing purposes.

**Requirements:**
- Dedicated password reset page accessible from login
- Admin interface to select any user and reset their password
- Proper validation and security measures
- User-friendly interface with clear feedback

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `/reset-password` route and PasswordResetPage component
- User selection dropdown with name and email display
- Password confirmation with validation rules
- Backend `/auth/reset-password` endpoint with bcrypt hashing
- Accessible via "Reset Password" button on login page

### 6. IT Activities Seed Generator
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Create a configurable system for generating realistic IT Activities data for testing and demonstration.

**Requirements:**
- JSON configuration file for customizable parameters
- Support for date ranges and activity frequencies
- Generate realistic email, document, and calendar activities
- Include weekly recurring meetings and client meetings
- Rich metadata generation for each activity type

**Implementation Details:**
- `itActivitiesConfig.json` with configurable collections and parameters
- `itActivitiesGenerator.ts` with sophisticated activity generation
- Supports legal topics, document types, email subjects, meeting types
- Generates activities with realistic timing and metadata
- Integrated with main seed script for automatic generation

## Configuration Files

### IT Activities Seed Configuration
Location: `backend/prisma/seeds/itActivitiesConfig.json`

**Structure:**
- `startDate` and `endDate`: Date range for activity generation
- `frequency`: Daily/weekly activity counts for each type
- `collections`: Arrays of realistic content for different activity types
- `meetings`: Configuration for recurring and client meetings

**Supported Collections:**
- Legal topics
- Document types
- Email subjects
- Relativity query types
- Claude session titles
- Co-counsel session titles

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Enhanced TimesheetPage validation logic
- Added text search filter to ITActivityPage
- Created PasswordResetPage component
- Updated routing configuration
- Improved user feedback and validation messages

### Backend Changes
- Enhanced IT Activities API with text search support
- Added password reset endpoint in auth routes
- Created configurable IT Activities seed generator
- Enhanced validation logic with time period awareness

### Database Changes
- Utilizes existing settings for maxHoursPerDay and maxHoursPerWeek
- No schema changes required
- Enhanced seed data generation capabilities

## Testing Scenarios

### Timesheet Validation Testing
1. Test with different user types (hours vs. percentage)
2. Test expired vs. current timesheet periods
3. Test under-target and over-target scenarios
4. Verify proper warning messages with all relevant values

### IT Activities Testing
1. Test text search with various keywords
2. Test metadata popup display for different activity types
3. Test generated activities with realistic data
4. Verify search performance with large datasets

### Password Reset Testing
1. Test user selection and password validation
2. Test successful password reset flow
3. Test login with reset passwords
4. Verify proper error handling

## Future Enhancements

### Low Priority Items (Not Implemented)
1. **Export functionality to CSV with filters**
   - Export timesheet and IT Activities data
   - Support filtering by team member, date range, matters
   - Multiple export formats and selection criteria

2. **Enhanced settings admin page with data types**
   - Support for different setting data types (Enum, Integer, String)
   - Advanced validation and input controls
   - Settings metadata and constraints

These items can be addressed in future feature releases based on user feedback and business priorities.
