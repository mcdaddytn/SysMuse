12:41:11    4             COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

12:41:12    5             THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

01:00:54    6             Counsel, we have received a second note from the

01:00:58    7   jury.

01:00:59    8             I will read it to you, and I'll mark it for

01:01:04    9   identification and hand it to the courtroom deputy.

01:01:06   10             The second note reads as follows:        Can we please

01:01:10   11   see the Abutalebi patent, question mark?         Thank you,

01:01:21   12   Elizabeth Edwards.

01:01:22   13             I'll mark that for identification with a 2 in the

01:01:25   14   upper right-hand corner and hand it to the courtroom

01:01:27   15   deputy.

01:01:28   16             It appears to me, counsel, that what they're

01:01:35   17   requesting is DTX-46, which is the patent application

01:01:39   18   publication for this gentleman, whose last name I won't

01:01:46   19   pronounce very well, so I won't try.

01:01:49   20             I have a prepared response to send to the jury

01:01:51   21   with the actual exhibit, which reads as follows:           Response

01:01:56   22   to Jury Note No. 2.     Members of the jury, in response to

01:02:00   23   your second note, I am sending you DTX-46.

01:02:04   24             Is there any objection to that written response,

01:02:07   25   together with the identified exhibit, being sent to the

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 341 Filed 10/09/20 Page 7 of 136 PageID #: 19802
                                                                                   1400



01:02:10    1   jury from the Plaintiff?

01:02:12    2           MR. FABRICANT:      No objection, Your Honor.

01:02:14    3           THE COURT:     Defendant?

01:02:15    4           MR. DACUS:     No, Your Honor.

01:02:17    5           THE COURT:     I'll hand the signed note and the

01:02:21    6   exhibit itself to the courtroom deputy, and direct him to

01:02:24    7   deliver it to the jury in the jury room.

01:02:27    8           And since it is 1:00 o'clock, counsel,

01:02:32    9   understanding that we may be interrupted with additional

01:02:35   10   notes or a possible verdict by the jury, I see no reason

01:02:38   11   not to go ahead and start the bench trial regarding

01:02:40   12   Amazon's defense of inequitable conduct.

01:02:42   13           I am going to hold you to the time estimates you

01:02:50   14   gave me earlier, so I'm expecting this should take no more

01:02:55   15   than an hour and a half.

01:02:56   16           So, with that, Mr. Re, let me hear from you on

01:03:01   17   behalf of the Defendants.

01:03:02   18           (Bench trial.)

01:03:02   19           MR. RE:    Thank you, Your Honor.        Mr. Re for the

01:03:02   20   Amazon Defendants.

01:03:02   21           Amazon calls as its first witness on this bench

01:03:05   22   trial on the subject of inequitable conduct Dr. Peter Li.

01:03:08   23           THE COURT:     All right.    Dr. Li, if you'll return

01:03:11   24   to the witness stand.     I remind you that you remain under

01:03:16   25   oath from your earlier testimony in this trial.           If you'll

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 341 Filed 10/09/20 Page 8 of 136 PageID #: 19803
                                                                                   1401



01:03:22    1   just have a seat on the witness stand.

01:03:24    2               And, counsel, the Court's belief is that this

01:03:31    3   witness is being called adversely, and the calling party

01:03:35    4   should have the right to lead the witness.

01:03:37    5               MR. RE:    Thank you, Your Honor.

01:03:37    6        QI "PETER" LI, DEFENDANTS' WITNESS, PREVIOUSLY SWORN

01:03:37    7                             DIRECT EXAMINATION

01:03:38    8   BY MR. RE:

01:03:38    9   Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Li.

01:03:44   10   A.   Good afternoon.

01:03:44   11   Q.   We have a binder for you, should you want to see any

01:03:50   12   original document.

01:04:25   13               Are you ready to begin?

01:04:27   14   A.   Yes.

01:04:28   15   Q.   Okay.    When I was examining you last week, you and I

01:04:35   16   discussed some patent applications that you filed back in

01:04:38   17   2005 and 2006.        Do you remember that?

01:04:42   18   A.   Yes.
