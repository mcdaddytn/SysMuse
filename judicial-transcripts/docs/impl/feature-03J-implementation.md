# Feature-03J Implementation Status

## Completed Fixes

### 1. ✅ Remove Speaker Creation from OverrideImporter.ts
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed all `tx.speaker.create()` calls from OverrideImporter
  - Removed speaker utility imports
  - Updated attorney/judge/witness creation to work without speakers
  - Speakers are now only created during transcript parsing

### 2. ✅ Add Override Fields in LLMExtractor.ts
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `addOverrideFields()` method to automatically add configuration
  - Attorneys: `overrideAction: "Upsert"`, `overrideKey: "attorneyFingerprint"`
  - Judges: `overrideAction: "Upsert"`, `overrideKey: "judgeFingerprint"`
  - LawFirms: `overrideAction: "Upsert"`, `overrideKey: "lawFirmFingerprint"`
  - LawFirmOffices: `overrideAction: "Upsert"`, `overrideKey: "lawFirmOfficeFingerprint"`
  - CourtReporters: `overrideAction: "Upsert"`, `overrideKey: "courtReporterFingerprint"`
  - Trials: `overrideAction: "Insert"`, `overrideKey: "caseNumber"`
  - Addresses: `overrideAction: "Insert"`

### 3. ✅ Change OverrideImporter Defaults to Upsert
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Changed all default `overrideAction` from "Update" to "Upsert"
  - This ensures new data can be inserted while existing data is updated

### 4. ✅ Make speakerId Optional in Schema
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `Attorney.speakerId` to be optional (`Int?`)
  - Updated `Judge.speakerId` to be optional (`Int?`)
  - `Witness.speakerId` was already optional
  - Updated related TypeScript code to handle null speakerId

### 5. ✅ Fix LawFirmOffice Constraint Handling
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - LawFirmOffice now uses fingerprint-based deduplication
  - Upsert operations work correctly with `lawFirmOfficeFingerprint`

## Testing Results

### Phase 1 Import Testing
✅ Successfully imported 3 trials with override metadata:
- 01 Genband: 3 attorneys, 1 judge, 1 court reporter
- 02 Contentguard: 12 attorneys, 1 judge, 1 court reporter  
- 04 Intellectual Ventures: 4 attorneys, 1 judge, 1 court reporter

### Phase 1 Parsing Testing
✅ Successfully parsed all 5 trials:
- 215,211 lines parsed
- Speaker prefixes correctly extracted (e.g., "THE COURT:", "MR. DACUS:")
- 0 speakers created (correct - should be created in phase2)
- 19 attorneys with speaker prefixes from overrides
- 8 trials total (3 with overrides, 5 parsed)

## Pending Work

### Phase 2 Speaker Identification
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Required Implementation**:
  1. When processing lines with speaker prefixes:
     - Look up Attorney/Judge by speakerPrefix field
     - Create Speaker record on first encounter
     - Link Speaker to Attorney/Judge if match found
     - Create AnonymousSpeaker if no match
  2. Handle Q/A patterns during examination
  3. Ignore "BY MR. X" as speaker (it's examination context)

## Key Findings

1. **Speaker Creation Timing**: Speakers must be created during parsing, not import
2. **Override Fields**: LLM extractor must add proper override configuration
3. **Schema Requirements**: speakerId must be optional for attorneys/judges
4. **Fingerprint Deduplication**: Critical for multi-trial support
5. **Examination Context**: "BY MR. X" is NOT a speaker prefix

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase2 speaker identification logic
2. Test complete workflow: parse → generate LLM overrides → import → re-parse
3. Verify speaker-attorney matching works correctly
4. Document final workflow in feature guide
