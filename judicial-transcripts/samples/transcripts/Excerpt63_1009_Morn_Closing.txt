10:43:19   12            I -- I know you remember that several times the

10:43:21   13   Plaintiffs have put up slides in the course of this

10:43:25   14   lawsuit, and the title of them has been American Dream.

10:43:30   15            THE COURT:    Two minutes remaining.

10:43:31   16            MR. DACUS:    Thank you, Your Honor.

10:43:32   17            And I thought to myself when I saw those slides,

10:43:35   18   the American dream ought not be filing lawsuits against

10:43:40   19   companies who have worked hard to be successful.            Indeed,

10:43:44   20   that's not the American dream, nor should it be.

10:43:47   21            But, thankfully, under our Constitution, folks

10:43:52   22   like Amazon can come to the courthouse, they can defend

10:43:55   23   themselves, they can put the facts and evidence in front of

10:43:57   24   you, and they can let a jury determine whether or not this

10:44:00   25   kind of stuff ought to stop.

                                                                                    1375



10:44:04    1            And that's why Amazon is here, because this kind

10:44:07    2   of stuff needs to stop, and it needs to stop here.            Amazon

10:44:13    3   can't stop it.     Only a jury can stop it.       That's why we ask

10:44:17    4   you to help us.

10:44:19    5            In just a few minutes, you're going to go, retire,

10:44:23    6   you're going to get all these questions on the verdict form

10:44:27    7   from the Judge.     And Amazon looks very forward to receiving

10:44:32    8   your verdict.

10:44:33    9            I want to end by saying, on behalf of the men and

10:44:36   10   women who work at Amazon, a very sincere thank you.             And I

10:44:36   11   want to be clear, that "thank you" is not conditional on

10:44:41   12   how you answer these questions; it's not.          All Amazon ever

10:44:42   13   wanted was an opportunity to defend itself, present the

10:44:48   14   facts to you, and let the chips fall where they may.             And

10:44:51   15   they -- they would not have that opportunity without you,

10:44:54   16   and we're very much appreciative of it.

10:44:56   17            Now, these folks are going to get to stand up and

10:44:59   18   talk again.     We're not going to get to say a word.         I'm

10:45:02   19   going to have to depend on you.        I don't know what they're

10:45:06   20   going to say.     But I'm going to have to depend on you that

10:45:10   21   no matter what they say, you will go back in your mind and

10:45:13   22   search the evidence to determine whether or not what they

10:45:15   23   say in the next 10 minutes is accurate or not.

10:45:17   24            Thank you very much.

10:45:18   25            Thank you, Your Honor.

10:45:20    1            THE COURT:    All right.     Plaintiff may now present

10:45:21    2   its final closing argument.

10:45:23    3            MR. FABRICANT:     Thank you, Your Honor.

10:45:33    4            Members of the jury, I just want to revisit some

10:45:36    5   facts for a moment, because I had a hard time believing

10:45:39    6   what I just heard.     We heard about 12 or 15 minutes of, the

10:45:42    7   Echo devices do not have this adaptive beamforming, they

10:45:45    8   don't understand why we're saying that it does, why don't

10:45:53    9   they look at the source code.
