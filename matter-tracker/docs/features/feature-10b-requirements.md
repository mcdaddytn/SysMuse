Reporting

Report #2 (Medium Priority)
Matter Summary

Let's build a Matter Summary report that will show Matter name and description, task name and description, team member, projected hours and actual hours for any given timesheet period.  Let's add filter dropdowns next to date selection for Team Member and Matter, but they can default to blank (meaning include all).  If we select a single matter and/or team member, it should filter appropriately, and we should be able to remove the filters.
