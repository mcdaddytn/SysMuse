# Feature 02M Implementation Guide

## Session Summary
In this session, we:
1. Implemented strict speaker matching from feature-02L
2. Discovered significant regression issues through systematic comparison
3. Created regression testing infrastructure
4. Identified root causes for discrepancies

## Key Achievements

### 1. Regression Testing Infrastructure
- Created `scripts/export-comparison-data.ts` to export parser output
- Created `scripts/compare-parsers.ts` for side-by-side comparison
- Established baseline data from legacy parser
- Documented repeatable testing process

### 2. Feature-02L Implementation
- Implemented strict speaker matching (no regex patterns)
- Reduced anonymous speakers from 92 to 2 (huge improvement!)
- Fixed false positive speaker detection

### 3. Issue Discovery
Through systematic comparison, we found:
- Complete session missing (JURY_VERDICT - 136 pages)
- Individual missing pages (4 pages)
- Statement event count at 50% of expected
- Line parsing differences

## Code Changes Made

### MultiPassContentParser.ts
- Replaced regex SPEAKER_PATTERNS with exact match COURT_OFFICIALS
- Implemented strict extractSpeaker() method
- Added attorney registry lookup
- Q/A patterns only valid during examination context

### SpeakerRegistry.ts
- Added `registerAttorney()` method
- Added `findAttorneyByHandle()` method
- Added attorneysByHandle Map for quick lookup

### ExaminationContextManager.ts
- Added `isInExamination()` method to validate Q/A context

## Regression Test Results

| Metric | Legacy | Multi-pass | Status |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|
| Pages | 1533 | 1529 | ❌ Missing 4 + entire session |
| Lines | 38,550 | 39,673 | ❌ +3% difference |
| Statement Events | 12,422 | 6,334 | ❌ -49% |
| Anonymous Speakers | 14 | 2 | ✅ Improved! |
| Attorneys | 19 | 16 | ❌ Missing 3 |
| Jurors | 39 | 0 | ❌ Not implemented |

## Root Causes Identified

### Missing JURY_VERDICT Session
- File exists but not being processed
- Filename pattern might not match: `(Bench Trial_Jury Verdict) be.txt`
- Needs investigation in file selection logic

### Statement Event Count
- Multi-pass aggregates ~6.8 lines per statement
- Legacy aggregates ~4.75 lines per statement
- Legacy might split on:
  - Page boundaries
  - Timestamp changes
  - After court directives
  - Other conditions beyond speaker changes

### Line Differences
- First lines completely different between parsers
- Suggests fundamental difference in line extraction
- May be related to page header handling

## Next Session Tasks

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Fix JURY_VERDICT parsing**
   - Check file pattern matching
   - Debug why file is skipped
   
2. **Fix missing pages**
   - Check last page detection
   - Verify page boundary logic

3. **Fix statement aggregation**
   - Analyze legacy parser statement creation
   - Identify all split conditions
   - Implement same logic in Phase2Processor

### Implementation Tasks
1. **Implement juror parsing**
   - Pattern: "JUROR NO. X" 
   - Reference legacy implementation

2. **Implement law firm/address parsing**
   - Parse from APPEARANCES section
   - Create associations

3. **Fix attorney count**
   - Ensure all attorneys from summary are captured

## Lessons Learned

1. **Regression testing is critical** - We found major issues only through comparison
2. **Side-by-side comparison is essential** - Abstract metrics hide specific problems
3. **Legacy code is the specification** - It works correctly, we must match it
4. **Small differences matter** - 3% line difference is unacceptable for legal transcripts

## Success Metrics for Completion

- [ ] All 1533 pages parsed
- [ ] Statement events: 12,422 ± 1%
- [ ] Lines: 38,550 ± 1%
- [ ] All entity types parsed
- [ ] Regression test passes
