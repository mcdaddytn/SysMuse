Feature 10

Reporting


Add another link in toolbar at top of screen for reporting, accessible only to admin level.  Add a reporting page that will have a date control (like the timesheet), moving in increments of weekly (assuming that is the timesheet mode), so that the admin can choose a time period.  

Report #1 (High Priority)
Team Summary

The reporting page should show each team member for the time period with the projected hours worked, actual hours worked.  Also include projected and actual hours at each urgency level as a separate column (so flatten out data by Urgency hot, medium, or mild to create Hot Projected Hours, Hot Actual Hours, etc.).  Have the report sortable by any of the columns (team member or any of the hours fields), ascending or descending.  


Extra features for Report #1 (Medium Priority)

Implement a mouse-over popup on a given line of the report (for a given team member in the selected time period), that will show their full timesheet information.  Show each matter, task, projected, and actual hours when we mouse-over that particular team member in the summary report screen.  Show a nicely configured tabular view of the timesheet data in that mouseover popup.
