# Feature 02V Implementation Status

## Current State (as of 2025-09-02)

### Overview
Feature 02V focused on improving attorney identification and witness association during Phase 2 processing. Significant progress has been made on participant parsing, though some issues remain with attorney detection from SessionSection records.

## Completed Fixes

### 1. ✅ Witness Detection Pattern Enhancement
**Location**: `src/parsers/Phase2Processor.ts` (lines 77-81)

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Old patterns (missed plural forms)
witnessName: /^([A-Z][A-Z\s,'"\.\-]+?),?\s+(PLAINTIFF'S?|DEFENDANT'S?)\s+WITNESS(?:\s|,|$)/i

// New patterns (handles all variations)
witnessName: /^([A-Z][A-Z\s,'"\.\-]+?),?\s+(PLAINTIFF'?S?'?|DEFENDANT'?S?'?|DEFENSE)\s+WITNESS(?:ES)?(?:\s|,|$)/
```

**Variations Now Handled**:
- `PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS` (333 instances found)
- `PLAINTIFFS' WITNESS` (52 instances)
- `PLAINTIFFS WITNESS` (3 instances)
- `DEFENDANT'S WITNESS` (186 instances)
- `DEFENDANTS' WITNESS` (140 instances)
- `DEFENSE WITNESS`

**Test Results**:
- Trial 1: 14 witnesses detected (was 0)
- Trial 55: 14 witnesses detected
- Trial 10: 10+ witnesses detected

### 2. ✅ "BY MR./MS." Pattern Fix
**Location**: `src/parsers/Phase2Processor.ts` (lines 1111-1116)

**Problem**: "BY MR. SMITH:" lines were creating anonymous speakers

**Solution**: Added check to skip these lines as speaker statements
```typescript
// Skip "BY MR./MS." lines - these are attorney indicators, not speakers
if (line.speakerPrefix.match(/^BY\s+(MR\.|MS\.|MRS\.|DR\.)/)) {
  logger.debug(`Skipping BY MR./MS. line as speaker statement: ${line.speakerPrefix}`);
  return false;
}
```

**Result**: No more "BY MR." entries in anonymous speakers table

### 3. ✅ Anonymous Speaker Whitelist
**Location**: `src/parsers/Phase2Processor.ts` (lines 1350-1359)

**Limited to Valid Court Personnel**:
```typescript
const knownAnonymousSpeakers = [
  'COURT SECURITY OFFICER', 
  'COURTROOM DEPUTY',
  'BAILIFF', 
  'COURT REPORTER', 
  'INTERPRETER',
  'THE CLERK',
  'CLERK'
];
```

**Changed Behavior**: Unknown speakers now return null instead of creating anonymous records (lines 1376-1382)

### 4. ✅ Attorney and Judge Loading from SessionSection
**Location**: `src/parsers/Phase2Processor.ts` (lines 206-348)

**New Method**: `loadParticipantsFromSessionSections()`
- Loads from `JUDGE_INFO` SessionSection type
- Loads from `APPEARANCES` SessionSection type
- Creates Speaker records for each participant
- Creates Attorney records with proper associations

**Implementation**:
```typescript
private async loadParticipantsFromSessionSections(trialId: number): Promise<void> {
  // Load JUDGE_INFO sections
  // Create judge with speaker association
  
  // Load APPEARANCES sections
  // Parse plaintiffAttorneys from metadata
  // Parse defendantAttorneys from metadata
  // Create attorney records with speakers
}
```

## Current Issues

### 1. ⚠️ Incomplete Attorney Parsing from SessionSection

**Problem**: Defendant attorneys often missing or in different sessions

**Example from Trial 1**:
- Sessions 1-7: Have plaintiff attorneys, defendantAttorneys array is empty
- Session 8: Has defendant attorneys in metadata
- This split causes incomplete attorney loading

**Current Data**:
```sql
-- Trial 1: 8 plaintiff attorneys in early sessions, 9 defendant attorneys in session 8
-- Trial 2: 0 plaintiff, 0 defendant (empty metadata)
-- Trial 3: 5 plaintiff, 0 defendant
-- Trial 4: 6 plaintiff, 0 defendant
-- Trial 5: 0 plaintiff, 1 defendant
```

### 2. ⚠️ Attorney Name Parsing Limitations

**Current Simple Implementation**:
```typescript
// Guesses MR. for all attorneys
speakerPrefix = `MR. ${lastName}`;
```

**Issues**:
- No gender detection for MS./MRS.
- No title detection (DR., etc.)
- Law firms included as attorneys (filtered by checking for 'LLP')

### 3. ⚠️ Cross-Trial Matching Not Implemented

**Judge Matching**: Currently creates new judge per trial, no fingerprinting
**Attorney Matching**: No cross-trial attorney identification

## Database State After Fixes

### Trial 1 Results (Clean Run):
```
Attorneys: 15 created
Judge: 1 created (RODNEY GILSTRAP)
Witnesses: 14 detected
Anonymous Speakers: 2 (COURT SECURITY OFFICER, COURTROOM DEPUTY)
Statement Events: 12,767
Witness Events: 76
Directive Events: 445
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/parsers/Phase2Processor.ts**
   - Enhanced witness detection patterns
   - Fixed BY MR. pattern handling
   - Added participant loading from SessionSection
   - Limited anonymous speaker creation

2. **docs/features/feature-02V.md**
   - Documented all witness pattern variations
   - Listed expected vs actual witnesses for validation

3. **docs/impl/feature-02V-implementation.md**
   - Created comprehensive validation guide
   - Added SQL queries for validation
   - Documented statistical analysis methods

## Validation Queries

### Check Participants
```sql
-- Summary of all participants for a trial
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Attorney" a 
   JOIN "Speaker" s ON a."speakerId" = s.id 
   WHERE s."trialId" = 1) as attorneys,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Judge" WHERE "trialId" = 1) as judges,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Witness" WHERE "trialId" = 1) as witnesses,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Speaker" 
   WHERE "trialId" = 1 AND "speakerType" = 'ANONYMOUS') as anonymous;
```

### Verify No BY MR. Anonymous Speakers
```sql
SELECT s."speakerPrefix" 
FROM "Speaker" s 
WHERE s."speakerType" = 'ANONYMOUS' 
  AND s."trialId" = 1 
  AND s."speakerPrefix" LIKE 'BY%';
-- Should return 0 rows
```

### Check Witness Detection Rate
```sql
WITH phase1_potential AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT l.text) as count
  FROM "Line" l
  JOIN "Page" p ON l."pageId" = p.id
  JOIN "Session" s ON p."sessionId" = s.id
  WHERE s."trialId" = 1
    AND l.text LIKE '%WITNESS%'
    AND (l.text LIKE '%PLAINTIFF%' OR l.text LIKE '%DEFENDANT%')
    AND l.text NOT LIKE '%THE WITNESS%'
),
phase2_detected AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM "Witness" WHERE "trialId" = 1
)
SELECT 
  p1.count as "Phase1 Potential",
  p2.count as "Phase2 Detected",
  ROUND(100.0 * p2.count / p1.count, 1) as "Detection Rate %"
FROM phase1_potential p1, phase2_detected p2;
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Load attorneys from all sessions**: Scan all SessionSection records, not just first ones
2. **Improve attorney name parsing**: Better title detection (MR./MS./DR.)
3. **Filter law firms better**: More robust detection of firm names

### Future Enhancements (Feature-02W)
1. **LLM-based parsing**: Use AI to extract participants from summary text
2. **Cross-trial matching**: Implement fingerprinting for judges and attorneys
3. **Seed file generation**: Create reusable participant data
4. **Law firm associations**: Properly link attorneys to firms

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Reset database and seed
- [x] Run Phase 1 on first 5 trials
- [x] Check SessionSection metadata populated
- [x] Run Phase 2 on each trial
- [x] Verify attorneys created
- [x] Verify judge created
- [x] Verify witnesses detected
- [x] Verify no BY MR. anonymous speakers
- [ ] Verify all attorneys loaded (including defendants)
- [ ] Test cross-trial judge matching
- [ ] Generate validation report

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Reset and run Phase 1
npx prisma db push --force-reset && npm run seed
npx ts-node src/cli/parse.ts parse --phase1 --config config/multi-trial-config-mac.json --parser-mode multi-pass

# Run Phase 2 on specific trial
npx ts-node src/cli/parse.ts parse --phase2 --config config/multi-trial-config-mac.json --trial-id 1

# Validate results
./scripts/validate-phase2.sh 1
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Attorney parsing depends on SessionSection quality**: If Phase 1 doesn't parse APPEARANCES correctly, Phase 2 can't load attorneys
2. **No law firm entity creation yet**: Law firms mentioned but not stored separately
3. **No court reporter parsing**: CERTIFICATION section not processed
4. **Simple name parsing**: Basic lastName extraction, no sophisticated name parsing
5. **No bar number or other attorney metadata**: Just name and speaker association

## Success Metrics Achieved

- ✅ 50%+ witness detection rate (was 0%)
- ✅ Zero "BY MR." anonymous speakers (was creating many)
- ✅ Only valid court personnel as anonymous speakers
- ✅ Attorneys loading from SessionSection metadata
- ✅ Judge loading from SessionSection metadata
- ✅ Proper Speaker associations for all participants

## Conclusion

Feature 02V has significantly improved participant detection and association. The main remaining issue is incomplete attorney loading due to SessionSection data being spread across multiple sessions. The foundation is now in place for Feature 02W (LLM-based parsing) to provide more complete and accurate participant extraction.
