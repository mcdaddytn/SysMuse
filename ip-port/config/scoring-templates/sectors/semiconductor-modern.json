  "contextDescription": "Modern semiconductor patents use the H10 CPC classification introduced in 2023 to reorganize semiconductor device patents. Key areas include H10B (memory devices), H10D (semiconductor devices), H10F (radiation-sensitive devices), H10K (organic electronics), and H10N (electric solid-state devices). These patents cover the latest device innovations and manufacturing techniques.",
