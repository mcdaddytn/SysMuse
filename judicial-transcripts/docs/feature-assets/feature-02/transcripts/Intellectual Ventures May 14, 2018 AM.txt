2                   COURT SECURITY OFFICER:     All rise.

3                   THE COURT:     Thank you.   Be seated, please.

4                   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.       My name is

5      Rodney Gilstrap, and I am the resident United States

6      District Judge here in the Marshall Division of the Eastern

7      District of Texas.      I have lived in Marshall since 1981.         I

8      practiced law here for 30 years before being appointed to

9      the bench.    I've been serving here on the bench since 2011.

10                  I will confess, I was not born in Texas.        I was

11     born in Florida.     But as they say, I got here as quickly as

12     I could.     I came to Texas to go to college and then to law

13     school at Baylor University.

14                  I'm married.   I have two grown children.       My wife

15     owns and operates a retail floral business here in Marshall.

16                  Now, I tell you all these things about myself

17     because in a few minutes, I'm going to ask each of you to

18     tell me the same kind of information about each of

19     yourselves, and I think you're entitled to know as much

20     about me as I'm about to find out about each of you all.

21                  We're about to engage in the selection of a jury

22     in a civil case involving allegations of patent

23     infringement.     However, before we go any further, I'd like

24     to briefly review with you how we came to have a jury trial

25     system for civil cases like this one.

1                  If you look back in history and you go back to the

2      first five books of the Old Testament, the Pentateuch,

3      you'll see that the ancient Jewish nation empaneled juries

4      for the purposes of determining property ownership and

5      property value.     The ancient Greeks began using a jury

6      system about 1500 B.C.      The Romans, as they did many things,

7      borrowed the concept of the jury system from the Greeks and

8      implemented it throughout their empire, and as a part of

9      that, the Romans brought the jury system to what is now

10     England about the 4th century AD when they conquered that

11     island.

12                 So by the 12th century AD, the concept of jury

13     trials in England had been well established for 800 years.

14     But then in the 12th century AD a tyrannical king came to

15     the throne of England named King John, and one of the things

16     he tried to do was do away with the right to trial by jury.

17     That and other disputes between the king and his nobles led

18     to a confrontation that bordered on civil war, but it was --

19     civil war was avoided by means of a compromise and a

20     resolution of all those disputes between King John and his

21     nobles, and that was set forth in a document signed at a

22     location called Runnymede, and the document has since

23     been -- come to be known as the Magna Carta.

24                 As a matter of fact, ladies and gentlemen, there

25     are 28 of our 50 United States that have taken the language

5   




1      guaranteeing the right to trial by jury from the Magna Carta

2      and inserted it verbatim into their own state constitutions.

3                  So you can see that the concept of jury trials and

4      jury trials in civil cases were deeply engrained in our

5      founding fathers as British colonists here in America.            But

6      after over a hundred years of jury trials in colonial

7      America, under Great Britain, another tyrannical king came

8      to the throne of England, this time his name was King George

9      III, and like King John, King George III attempted to do

10     away with and restrict the right to trial by jury among his

11     subjects here in America.

12                 As a matter of fact, Thomas Jefferson, in writing

13     the Declaration of Independence which sets forth

14     specifically the various grounds which require separation of

15     our country from England in the formation of a new

16     independent United States, spells out specifically the

17     king's attempt to restrict and do away with the right to

18     trial by jury as one of the reasons why we were forced to

19     separate from England and form our own independent nation.

20                 As a matter of fact, after the revolution was

21     complete, you all know that we adopted the governing

22     document for our country known as the constitution of the

23     United States.     Shortly after the constitution was ratified,

24     the first 10 amendments to the constitution, which you all

25     know to be called the Bill of Rights, were added to the
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 6 of 114 PageID #: 45208

6   




1      constitution.     In that Bill of Rights, in that first 10

2      amendments, the Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to

3      trial by jury in a civil case.

4                  The Seventh Amendment, along with the other 10

5      first amendments in the Bill of Rights were ratified in

6      1791.    So since 1791, every American system -- citizen has

7      had a constitutional right to a trial by jury in a civil

8      case.    We're the only country in the world that gives that

9      kind of guarantee and that kind of right to its citizens.

10                 So I think it's important for you to understand

11     the historical background that led to each of you being

12     summonsed to appear today in this United States District

13     Court for jury duty in a civil case.

14                 By being here, ladies and gentlemen, in my view,

15     you are each doing very real public service, and you are

16     doing your part as citizens to preserve, protect, and defend

17     our constitution, including the Seventh Amendment

18     guaranteeing this right to trial by jury.

19                 I always tell people who appear for jury duty that

20     in my personal opinion, jury service is the second highest

21     form of public service that any American citizen can render.

22     In my opinion, the highest form of public service are those

23     young men and women who wear the uniform of our armed forces

24     and put their lives on the line to protect our freedom.

25                 Now, later this morning, ladies and gentlemen, the

1      lawyers for each of the parties in this case are going to

2      address you, and they're going to ask you various questions.

3      I want you to understand that they will not be seeking to

4      inquire -- inquire into your private affairs unduly.            Said

5      another way, they're not trying to pry into your personal

6      business or be nosy.      They are asking questions that they

7      are entitled to ask, and they do that for purposes of

8      helping secure a fair and an impartial jury to hear the

9      evidence in this case.

10                 Also, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know if it

11     will happen today, it -- it -- it is not common, it rarely

12     does, but occasionally someone on a jury panel such as this

13     will be asked a question by one of the lawyers that that

14     particular jury panel member will perceive as being so

15     personal and so private that they're not comfortable

16     answering that question in front of everyone else.           I don't

17     think that will happen, but if it does happen, each of you

18     has the right to simply say I'd like to discuss that with

19     Judge Gilstrap.     And if that's your answer, I'll provide an

20     opportunity for you to answer that question outside of the

21     presence of everyone else on the panel.         But as I say,

22     that's not likely to happen.        It rarely comes up, but I want

23     you to know in case it does, that option is available to

24     you.

25                 The important thing, ladies and gentlemen, is for

1      each of you to give full, complete, and truthful answers to

2      the questions that are asked.        There are no wrong answers,

3      as long as your responses are full, complete, and truthful.

4                   Now, the trial in this case will start later today

5      after the jury has been selected, and I expect that the

6      trial will extend and go through probably Monday of next

7      week.    It's possible we could go as far as Tuesday of next

8      week, but I don't think so.       My best guess is that we will

9      finish the trial and complete everything by Monday of next

10     week, a week from today.

11                  That being the case, I need to know if there's

12     anyone on the panel who has either non-refundable overseas

13     airline tickets already purchased or you have a surgical

14     procedure scheduled for you or an immediate member of your

15     family, something that would make it very, very difficult

16     for you to be here that entire time if you were selected on

17     the jury.

18                  If you have that kind of serious impediment to you

19     being here throughout the trial, then I need to know about

20     it.     And if that's the case, let me ask you to raise your

21     hand so I can make a note of it.

22                  Okay.   Number 6.   Nobody on the second row.

23     Number 17, Number 20.      Anybody else?     Six, 17, and 20.     All

24     right.    Thank you very much.

25                  At this time, I'm going to call for announcements

10                 THE COURT:     Okay.   Thank you.

11                 Ladies and gentlemen, as I told you, this is a

12     patent case arising under the patent laws of the United

14     its patents were infringed by the Defendant, and it's

15     seeking money damages because of that infringement.

16                 The Defendants deny that they infringe the

17     Plaintiff's patents, and they contend that those patents are

18     invalid.

19                 Now, what I've just told you is a very informal

20     shorthand way of describing this case in layman's terms.             I

21     know that you've each seen the patent video film produced by

22     the Federal Judicial Center.        And having seen that, you know

23     more about patent cases than most people do when they appear

24     for jury duty in federal court.

25                 As I've said, the lawyers for both sides are going

1      to question the panel as part of this process, and as a part

2      of gathering relevant information to help them exercise

3      their rights as a part of securing a fair and impartial jury

4      to hear this case.     Again, ladies and gentlemen, there

5      aren't any wrong answers, as long as your responses are

6      full, complete, and truthful.

7                  One thing I do want to call your attention to

8      before the lawyers begin their questions because it's

9      possible they will ask you about your ability -- ability and

10     willingness to do this, I want to talk to you briefly about

11     the burden of proof.

12                 In a patent case, the jury may be called upon to

13     apply two different burdens of proof.         The jury may apply

14     the burden of proof known as the preponderance of the

15     evidence, as well as a second and different burden of proof

16     known as clear and convincing evidence.

17                 I'll say that again, the preponderance of the

18     evidence and clear and convincing evidence.

19                 When responding to lawyers' questions about the

20     burden of proof, I need to instruct you that when the party

21     has the burden of proof on any claim or defense by a

22     preponderance of the evidence, it means that the jury must

23     be persuaded by the credible or believable evidence that

24     that claim or defense is more probably true than not true.

25                 I'll say that again, more probably true than not
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 12 of 114 PageID #: 45214

12  




1      true.

2                   This is sometimes talked about as being the

3      greater weight and degree of credible testimony.          Let me see

4      if I can give you an example.       I think each of you can see

5      in front of me and in front of our court reporter a statue

6      of the Lady of Justice.      You'll notice that she's

7      blindfolded.     You'll notice in her right hand lowered at her

8      side is the sword of justice, in her left hand raised above

9      her head are the Scales of Justice.        Those scales are

10     balanced and equal, exactly the same.         And that's where the

11     parties should start out in this case, balanced and in the

12     same position.

13                  Think of it this way when you think about the

14     burden of proof.     Over the course of the trial, both the

15     Plaintiff and the Defendants will put on their evidence, and

16     that evidence goes on one side of the scales or the other,

17     depending on who presents it.       And after all the evidence is

18     in, the jury's going to be asked to answer certain

19     questions.     And in answering those questions, if the party

20     who has the burden of proof on that issue by a preponderance

21     of the evidence has those scales tip in their direction,

22     even if they tip ever so slightly, then that party has met

23     its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.

24                  On the other hand, a party who has the burden of

25     proof by clear and convincing evidence means that the jury
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 13 of 114 PageID #: 45215

13  




1      must have an abiding conviction of the truth -- that the

2      truth, rather, of the party's factual contentions are highly

3      probably.

4                  Let me say that again, an abiding conviction that

5      the truth of the party's factual contentions are highly

6      probable.

7                  This standard, the clear and convincing evidence

8      standard, is higher than the preponderance of the evidence

9      standard.    If you imagine the same examples I gave you --

10     same example I gave you with the Scales of Justice, all the

11     evidence placed on one side or the other of those scales and

12     the jury called upon after all the evidence is in to answer

13     certain questions, if the party who has the burden of proof

14     on an issue by clear and convincing evidence has those

15     scales tip in their favor, and they must in that case tip

16     more than ever so slightly, they must definitely tip in that

17     party's favor, and if they do, that party has met their

18     burden of clear and convincing evidence.

19                 Now, these two burdens of proof should not be

20     confused with a third and different burden of proof, which

21     I'm sure you've all heard about in media and the movies and

22     television called beyond a reasonable doubt.          Beyond a

23     reasonable doubt is a burden of proof that applies in

24     criminal cases.     It has absolutely no application in a civil

25     case such as this.
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 14 of 114 PageID #: 45216

14  




1                  You should not confuse clear and convincing

2      evidence with beyond a reasonable doubt.         Beyond a

3      reasonable doubt is a higher standard than clear and

4      convincing evidence, but clear and convincing evidence is a

5      higher standard than the preponderance of the evidence.

6                  Now, I give you these instructions in case some of

7      the lawyers in the case will want to ask you in a few

8      minutes about your ability to apply those two burdens of

9      proof to the evidence if you're selected to serve on this

10     jury.

11                 Now, before the lawyers address you, I'm going to

12     ask each one of you to stand and give me the answers to the

13     nine questions that you have before you, both in written

14     form and on the screens in front of you.         This is where I

15     get to find out as much about you as I told you about myself

16     when I came out this morning.

17                 We're going to do this in the following manner.

18     We're going to do it numerically.        We'll start with Panel

19     Member No. 1, Ms. Coyle.      And our Court Security Officer is

20     going to bring you a handheld microphone.         When you get the

21     handheld microphone, if you will stand, use that microphone,

22     and answer those nine questions, then we'll go on to Panel

23     No. 2, 3, and so forth, until we go through the entire

24     panel.

25                 Also, ladies and gentlemen, during the course of

1      the lawyers' questioning, which will follow these answers

2      that you're about to give, you should wait -- if you're

3      asked a specific question, you should wait until you get

4      that handheld microphone, and you should be sure to stand

5      and use the handheld when you give your answers.          It's a big

6      courtroom.    There are a lot of people in here.        And it's

7      important that you stand and use that handheld microphone

8      when you give any responses so that we can be sure everyone

9      clearly hears and understands what your responses are.

10                  So if you'll work with the Court and the Court

11     Security Officer in that regard, we'll appreciate it.

12                  If you'll take the microphone, Mr. Johnston, to

13     Panel Member No. 1.

14                  Ms. Coyle if you'll then give us your answers to

15     those nine questions, please.

2                   THE COURT:   Thank you, Mr. Lyons.

3                   All right.   Thank you very much, ladies and

4      gentlemen.

5                   Now I need to say a couple more things to you

6      before I turn the questioning over to the lawyers.           The

7      jurors that are actually selected to serve in this case will

8      serve as the judges of the facts.        And the jury selected

9      will make the sole determination about what the facts are in

10     this case.

11                  Now, my job as the Judge is to rule on questions

12     of law, evidence, and procedure, to maintain the decorum of

13     the court, and to oversee the flow of the evidence in the

14     trial.

15                  Also, I want to say a couple of things to you

16     about our judicial system that I think hopefully will help

17     those that are selected to serve and will put things in a

18     proper perspective.

19                  In every jury trial such as this, besides the

20     parties themselves, there are always three participants, the

21     jury, the Judge, and the lawyers.

22                  With regard to the lawyers, I think it's important

23     for all of you to understand that our judicial system is an

24     adversary system which simply means that during a trial,

25     each of the parties will seek to present their respective

2                  Now, it's no surprise to any of you that lawyers

3      are sometimes criticized in the public and the media, but

4      the Court's observed that some of this is the result of a

5      basic misunderstanding of our adversary judiciary -- or our

6      adversary judicial system.

7                  As an advocate, a lawyer is ethically and legally

8      obligated to zealously assert his or her's client's position

9      under the rules of our adversary system.         And by presenting

10     the best case possible on behalf of their clients, the

11     lawyers hopefully will enable the members of the jury to

12     better weigh the relevant evidence, to determine the truth,

13     and to arrive at a just verdict based on that evidence.

14                 Now, this system of justice, the American

15     adversary system of justice has served our country well for

16     over 200 years.     And America's lawyers are an integral part

17     of that process.     So as we go forward, even though it is

18     possible that through the course of the trial you may see me

19     frown or growl occasionally at the lawyers, it's simply

20     because I'm trying to make sure that their advocacy doesn't

21     get outside the boundaries of our adversary system.

22                 But keep in mind that they are doing their jobs,

23     and they're an important part of the process as we go

24     forward.

25                 Also, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to

1      understand that during the course of the trial, I'm going to

2      do my very best to make sure that the jury has no idea about

3      what I personally think about the evidence in this case

4      because evaluating the evidence and determining the facts

5      from that evidence is the job of the jury, and it's not my

6      job.

7                  So those of you selected to serve on the jury

8      should not take anything you see or you think you see as

9      coming from me as something to consider or to take into

10     account in making your decision about what the ultimate

11     facts are in this case.

12                 All right.    Mr. Davis, at this point, you may

13     address the jury on behalf of the Plaintiff.

14                 Would you like a warning on your time?

15                 MR. DAVIS:    Yes, Your Honor, I would.      If you

16     would give me three minutes, a warning.

17                 THE COURT:    I will do that.     You may proceed when

18     you're ready.

19                 MR. DAVIS:    Thank you, Your Honor.

20                 May it please the Court.

21                 THE COURT:    Proceed.

22                 MR. DAVIS:    Good morning.

23                 My name is Bo Davis.     It's my pleasure to

24     represent Intellectual Ventures in this lawsuit.          We're here

25     today because we believe that Federal Express is using four

1      United States patents that are owned by Intellectual

2      Ventures in the operation of their business.          And it's our

3      contention that if you make it on to this jury and you hear

4      the evidence, that the evidence is going to show that FedEx

5      is using these patents.

6                   So what are these patents about?      And His Honor

7      has given me a few minutes to give you just a high-level

8      overview of this case, and that's what I'd like to do.

9                   And so what are these -- what are these patents

10     about?     These patents deal with three different areas of

11     technology.

12                  The first area has to do with managing assets in

13     the field.     If you're a business and you have folks that are

14     in the field that are doing work, those folks need to be

15     managed.     And if you've got a lot of them, the more you

16     have, the more you need to manage.        So one of these patents

17     deals with how to manage assets in the field using a

18     handheld device.

19                  Another patent deals with how to exchange

20     information between computers using barcodes.          We all know

21     what a barcode is.     We see them everywhere.       But exchanging

22     information between barcodes is something that FedEx uses in

23     their business when they create labels.         So that's another

24     area of technology.

25                  And a third area of technology has to do with

1      tracking items as they move around a space.          So, for

2      example, if there was a big warehouse and you needed to

3      track inventory and items in that big warehouse as it moves

4      around the warehouse, tracking those packages or those items

5      using RFID tag technology.

6                  Now, what you're going to hear if you make it on

7      to the jury is in the late '90s, a man named Drew Barbosa

8      who owns a plumping company -- I'm sorry, a plumbing and air

9      conditioning company had seen his business grow, and he

10     needed to manage his assets in the field.         And so he came up

11     with a way to use these handheld devices to do just that, to

12     help his technicians in the field do what they needed to do.

13                 And you're going to hear another story from a man

14     named Mr. Les Baych who was working on this problem of how

15     to easily transfer data using barcodes between computers

16     because that's an important thing for the industry that he

17     was working in.

18                 Now, you're also going to hear that exchanging

19     data -- I'm sorry, that using bar -- RFID tags to track

20     these packages, to track items as they move around when you

21     have lots of things to track, that becomes very important.

22                 And it's our contention in this lawsuit that FedEx

23     is using these various technologies in the way that it does

24     what it does, which is deliver tens of thousands of packages

25     a day.   And they've used it starting a few years ago, and

1      once they started doing it, we found out about it, and

2      that's why we're here today.

3                  So -- so FedEx, of course, disputes everything we

4      say.   They say they don't use these patents.         They say that

5      they're not doing this, and they say that even if they are,

6      they were doing it a long time before these patents.

7                  And they also say that these patents are invalid.

8      They say they're no good.

9                  And then finally, they say that, look, even if --

10     even if we are using it, and we have to -- and there are

11     some damages and we have to pay some money, it should be a

12     very low amount.

13                 Now -- now is not the time to get into all the

14     details of that.     There's a lot more to this story.        And if

15     you make it on to this jury, you're going to hear all about

16     that, but I did want to give you just an overview of what

17     this case is about so that we can discuss any leanings that

18     you may have.

19                 As His Honor mentioned, the purpose of this

20     process right now is just for us to have a discussion.           And

21     hopefully, I'm going to be doing a lot of this talking, and

22     find out whether we have leanings as we come into this case

23     that may start us out leaning towards one side or the other.

24     Because as His Honor said, this is about finding a jury

25     that's going to provide a level playing field and allow --

1      allow everybody to have a fair shake.

2                   And so with that, I'd -- I'd like to do what --

3      what you all did, is just answer quickly these -- these nine

4      questions.

5                   I live in Longview, Texas.     I've been in Longview,

6      Texas, practicing law and raising my family, I've got four

7      kids.    My wife, she stays at home.      She's a homemaker.      She

8      takes care of the kids.      I went to law school.      My wife's

9      name is Annie.     And I've never been on a jury.

10                  So I appreciate you all answering those questions.

11     I felt like I should do it, as well.        It's only fair.

12                  And I'll start out with an easy question.          Does

13     anybody know any of the lawyers that are sitting at either

14     of these two tables?

15                  I don't see anybody raise their hands.

16                  Mr. Eric Findlay is sitting here.       Mr. Findlay is

17     a lawyer over in Tyler, Texas.       His law firm is Findlay

18     Craft.    And he has a partner named Brian Craft.        Does

19     anybody know Mr. Craft or Mr. -- Mr. Findlay?

20                  The rest of the lawyers for FedEx are from a law

21     firm called Finnegan Henderson.        Does everybody -- anybody

22     heard of that law firm?

23                  No, okay.   Good.

24                  Has anybody ever been a defendant in a lawsuit?

25                  Yes, sir.   Thank you, Mr. Anderson.

1                   Mr. Anderson, I don't necessarily need to get into

2      the specifics of -- yes, please, if you don't mind, stand

3      up.     Thank you, sir.

4                   I don't need to get into the specifics of it.         I'm

5      just curious whether the fact that you've ever been a

6      defendant might start you out leaning one way or another in

7      this lawsuit.

8                   JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:     I honestly can't answer

9      that.     I'm not sure yet because it's still pending.

10                  MR. DAVIS:   Okay.   Okay.   But you understand, sir,

11     that, you know, in this case, we're the plaintiff, and we're

12     asking for a finding in our favor.        Obviously, you being a

13     defendant, do you feel like there's any leanings that you

14     have, maybe sympathies, or that you identify more with FedEx

15     at all in this case given that you were a defendant?

16                  JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:     No, sir.

17                  MR. DAVIS:   Okay.   All right.    I appreciate that.

18     Thank you very much, Mr. Anderson.

19                  Anybody else ever been a defendant in a lawsuit?

20                  Okay.   Thank you.   I don't -- I don't -- I don't

21     see any hands.

22                  What about companies that you've worked for?

23     Anybody worked for a company that has been a defendant in a

24     lawsuit?

25                  Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Means?

1                   JUROR MEANS:     Yes.

2                   MR. DAVIS:     What company did you work for that was

3      a defendant in a lawsuit?

4                   JUROR MEANS:     Austin Bank.

5                   MR. DAVIS:     Austin Bank?

6                   JUROR MEANS:     Yes.

7                   MR. DAVIS:     Okay.    What kind of lawsuit was that?

8                   JUROR MEANS:     Patent infringement.

9                   MR. DAVIS:     Patent infringement lawsuit?

10                  JUROR MEANS:     Yes.

11                  MR. DAVIS:     Do you feel, sir, that -- that maybe

12     because your company was a defendant in a lawsuit defend --

13     about patents that you might start leaning towards the

14     Defendants in this case?

15                  JUROR MEANS:     No.

16                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.    Were you directly involved in

17     that case at all?

18                  THE COURT:     You're going to need to speak up,

19     Mr. Means.

20                  JUROR MEANS:     I was not -- I'm trying to remember

21     if I even had to gather any information.         I don't think I

22     was involved in it.

23                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.

24                  JUROR MEANS:     The bank has several lawsuits.     I

25     think they still have a couple pending.

1                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.    Thank you, sir.

2                  Anyone else work for a company -- yes, sir,

3      Mr. Edwards?

4                  JUROR EDWARDS:     Yeah, I worked for U.S. Steel.

5      I'm pretty certain we've had our share of lawsuits.           But I

6      haven't -- I haven't been any part of it.

7                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.    Does that maybe start you out

8      leaning one way or another in this lawsuit?

9                  JUROR EDWARDS:     No.

10                 MR. DAVIS:     Okay.    Thank you, and I appreciate

11     that.

12                 And I know that everybody can be -- you know, we

13     all think that we can be fair, and I'm not trying to

14     insinuate that you can't be.         All I'm trying to do is just

15     figure out who's the best jury to serve on this case.

16                 So I thank you very much for that.

17                 And anyone else?       I didn't -- I don't think I saw

18     anymore hands.

19                 Oh, yes, ma'am, Ms. Coyle.       Thank you.

20                 JUROR COYLE:     They were all settled outside of

21     court, but my boss has been involved in the -- in three, but

22     they've all been settled outside of court.

23                 MR. DAVIS:      Okay.    And who is your boss?

24                 JUROR COYLE:     Gage.

25                 MR. DAVIS:     Gage?

1                   JUROR COYLE:     Richard Gage.

2                   MR. DAVIS:      Okay.    And that -- what was the

3      company?

4                   JUROR COYLE:     Gage Construction.

5                   MR. DAVIS:     Gage Construction.     Is the fact that

6      Gage Construction was involved in lawsuits as a Defendant,

7      does that start you out at all -- you have --

8                   JUROR COYLE:     Not at all.

9                   MR. DAVIS:     You don't have any opinions one way or

10     another on that?

11                  JUROR COYLE:     No.

12                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.    Thank you very much, Ms. Coyle.

13                  Now, Intellectual Ventures is a unique company.

14     They're a company that their focus is inventions and

15     inventing things.     And they've got scientists and

16     laboratories, and they do lots of inventing.

17                  They also invent -- invest in patents that other

18     people invent, such as Mr. Barbosa and Mr. Baych.           And, you

19     know, they -- so they're a different company in the sense

20     that they do all kinds of things related to patents and

21     inventions.

22                  And I'm just wondering whether anybody has any

23     issues or any thoughts about a company that is primarily an

24     incubator.    They come up with ideas.        They invent things.

25     They may spin out companies, but they also have a component

1      of their company that involves investing in other patents,

2      acquiring patents, and sometimes they use those patents to

3      make products, sometimes they don't.

4                  And in this case, Intellectual Ventures is not

5      using these patents to make a product.         And I don't know if

6      anybody has ever thought about that before, but now that I

7      speak it to you, do you -- does anybody feel like, you know,

8      that's something that -- I don't know, does it strike

9      anybody as something that -- that may give them a problem or

10     think that they might start out leaning one way or another?

11                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      Yes, sir.

12                 MR. DAVIS:    Okay.   Thank you, sir.

13                 All right.    And, you know, a patent is a piece of

14     property, and it can be bought and sold.           And Mr. Barbosa,

15     Mr. Baych, the other inventors in this company, they

16     conveyed their patents to Intellectual Ventures.          Does

17     anybody have a problem with the fact that the inventors have

18     conveyed their patents to another company?          Does that strike

19     anybody as off in some way or something that might start you

20     out leaning one way or the another?        Okay.    I appreciate

21     that.    I don't see any hands.

22                 A number of folks indicated on their

23     questionnaires that they had a favorable impression of

24     FedEx.   And I -- you know, everybody at one point or another

25     has shipped a package or received a package from FedEx.            And

3                  Okay.   If I could -- Mr. Dement?

4                  JUROR DEMENT:    I really -- I really don't have

5      a --

6                  MR. DAVIS:    I'm sorry, sir, would you take the

7      mic, please?

8                  THE COURT:    Use the mic, please.

9                  JUROR DEMENT:    I really don't have a feeling on

10     them one way or the other.        It's just I know they're there,

11     and I rely on them to do what they're supposed to do.

12                 MR. DAVIS:    Okay.    You use them to ship packages

13     and --

14                 JUROR DEMENT:    I usually receive packages.

15                 MR. DAVIS:      Receive packages.

16                 JUROR DEMENT:    Yes.

17                 MR. DAVIS:    Okay.    And I saw Ms. -- Ms. Jenkins, I

18     saw you raise your hand.       Do you mind, Ms. Jenkins, telling

19     me, do you -- you have a favorable impression of FedEx?

20                 JUROR JENKINS:     Yes, I do.   I mean, I've received

21     a lot of packages through FedEx.        And my brother was vice

22     president in charge of cargo shipping in San Francisco for

23     about 20 years.

24                 MR. DAVIS:    For FedEx, ma'am?

25                 JUROR JENKINS:    Yes.

1                  MR. DAVIS:      Okay.    For 20 years.     Does the fact

2      that your brother worked there and any favorable impressions

3      you have generally of the company, does that start you out

4      leaning one way or the other?

5                  JUROR DEMENT:    No.     No, it doesn't.

6                  MR. DAVIS:      All right.    Well, I appreciate that.

7      Thank you very much.

8                  Anyone else -- yes, sir?

9                  JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:       It was the same as that

10     gentleman, just receiving packages.

11                 MR. DAVIS:    Okay.     Thank you, sir.    Thank you,

12     Mr. Anderson.

13                 Anyone else besides just generally receiving

14     packages have a favorable impression?

15                 Yes, sir, Mr. Anderson?

16                 THE COURT:    We have two Mr. Andersons on the

17     panel.

18                 MR. DAVIS:    I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor, Mr.

19     Leroy Anderson.

20                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:        Like I said, I worked for

21     UPS for those many years.       And what you have described,

22     well, I'm very familiar with.        I'm leaning toward Federal

23     Express because I know they do the same thing.           I did it so

24     many years.

25                 MR. DAVIS:    And I understand that, sir, and I -- I

1      appreciate that.     And if you'd hold on to the microphone, I

2      have just one follow-up question for you.         And do you feel,

3      sir, that even though you're going to hear a lot of evidence

4      in this case that despite the evidence, you would -- you

5      feel like you do start out leaning -- leaning towards FedEx?

6                   JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:     I didn't say I couldn't be

7      convinced.

8                   MR. DAVIS:   Sure.

9                   JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:     But you said leaning.

10                  MR. DAVIS:   Yes, sir.

11                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:     I'm leaning.

12                  MR. DAVIS:   Okay.   Thank you, sir.     I appreciate

13     -- I appreciate your honesty and your candor.          And I hope

14     everybody else recognizes that this is exactly the kind of

15     thing we're -- we're trying to understand.          We just want to

16     know if anybody's leaning one way or another because of

17     var -- the type case this is.

18                  So thank you very much, Mr. Anderson.

19                  Anybody else have any feelings similar to

20     Mr. Anderson?

21                  Yes, ma'am, No. 21, Ms. Adcock?

22                  JUROR ADCOCK:   My house is hard to get to

23     normally, and UPS will often drop my packages at another

24     house.   FedEx usually is able to deliver them directly to my

25     house, so kudos to them.      But I don't believe that would

1      make me influenced towards them.

2                  MR. DAVIS:    Okay.    I appreciate that, so they do a

3      good job getting the packages to your house.

4                  All right.    And even though they do that, you hear

5      the evidence, you can base your decision on the evidence.               I

6      see you nodding your head.        Thank you very much.

7                  JUROR ADCOCK:    Yes.

8                  MR. DAVIS:    Anyone else have anything to say about

9      FedEx in general, and I know that nobody has ever

10     heard of -- at least from what I saw on the questionnaires,

11     nobody had heard of Intellectual Ventures; is that correct?

12     Okay.   All right.

13                 Okay.    Thank you very much.

14                 I'd like to talk for a minute just about big

15     companies in general.      Does anybody just believe that, you

16     know, look, if there's a big company involved in a lawsuit,

17     I tend to side with that company?        I just start out leaning

18     in favor of that company because maybe I work for a big

19     company or I -- I just generally think big companies are

20     good for America or I just like big companies?          Does anybody

21     have -- have any feelings in that regard or leanings in that

22     way?    I don't -- I don't see anybody raising their hand.

23     So, okay, thank you.

24                 Now, another thing that's interesting about patent

25     cases is patents are, like we've talked about, a piece of
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 47 of 114 PageID #: 45249

47  




1      property.    And, you know, somebody can own a piece of

2      property, and you can be trespassing on that property

3      whether you know it or not.        Maybe somebody owns a piece of

4      property, and they don't have a fence up or they don't have

5      signs up or whatever.

6                  But in patent infringement, you can be using

7      someone else's technology, be on their property, trespassing

8      on their property, and the law says you don't have to know

9      that you're doing it.      If you're on there, that can still be

10     infringement.

11                 And so one of the things that's at issue in this

12     lawsuit is, you know, FedEx may not have known about these

13     patents until the lawsuit was filed.        And I just want to

14     know if anybody feels like that's something that may start

15     them out leaning one way or another.

16                 Does anybody feel that, you know, FedEx -- they

17     start leaning towards FedEx whether or not there was any

18     knowledge of patent infringement?

19                 Yes, sir, No. 3, Mr. Tony, yes, sir.

20                 JUROR TONY:    Yes.    I'm trying to basically

21     understand the process of what this is all about.

22                 MR. DAVIS:    Yes, sir.

23                 JUROR TONY:    But I'm kind of getting bits and

24     pieces upon it -- upon it.        But don't the post office and

25     Amazon do the same thing?

1                  MR. DAVIS:    Well --

2                  THE COURT:    Let me interrupt just a minute.       The

3      members of panel are here to answer the lawyers' questions,

4      and even if you've got a really good question, it's not your

5      place to ask the lawyers questions.        It's their job to cover

6      all the ground that needs to be covered.         So even though,

7      Mr. Tony, that's not a bad question, it's not the panel

8      member's position to ask questions.        The lawyers have got to

9      cover it for you, and it's their job.         And if they don't,

10     then they haven't done their job.

11                 Go ahead, Mr. Davis.

12                 MR. DAVIS:    Thank you, sir.

13                 So does anybody have a -- start out having a

14     leaning one way or another based on the fact that you could

15     be on somebody's property, not know about it?          No hands?

16     Okay.

17                 Okay.   I guess -- you know, what -- what --

18     another issue that -- that you may have to decide if you're

19     selected for this jury is the issue of damages, and FedEx in

20     this case, we're asking for over $90 million in this lawsuit

21     based upon the amount of use that FedEx has used these

22     patents and the amount of revenue that they've generated.

23     And so that's a lot -- that's -- that's a big number.           No

24     doubt about it.

25                 And I'm here to ask if anybody thinks that, look,
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 49 of 114 PageID #: 45251

49  




1      that number, I don't care what the evidence says, I could

2      never award that?       Does anybody feel -- and this is an

3      important question because, you know, I mean, that's --

4      that's one of the questions in this lawsuit, it's important.

5      Does anybody feel that, you know, no matter what the

6      evidence says, there's just no way that I think anybody

7      should ever be awarded that kind of money?

8                  Yes, sir?    Mr. -- Mr. Spiker; is that correct?

9                  JUROR NICHOLS:     No, Phil Nichols.

10                 MR. DAVIS:     I'm sorry, Mr. Nichols.

11                 JUROR NICHOLS:     Yes, sir, I just -- I don't

12     feel -- I feel with all this whole process of lawsuits and

13     everything has just gone way too far to begin with.            And

14     that's just an outrageous amount of money, I don't care what

15     the excuse was.

16                 MR. DAVIS:     Okay.   So no matter what the evidence

17     is, sir, you just -- I'm sorry, if you don't mind, I just

18     want to make sure I understand.

19                 JUROR NICHOLS:    That's correct.

20                 MR. DAVIS:    No matter what the evidence is, you

21     just really feel like you could never follow that, and if it

22     led you to that -- that number, you could never award it?

23                 JUROR NICHOLS:    No, I could not.

24                 MR. DAVIS:    Okay.    Thank you, sir.    I -- I

25     appreciate it.

1                  But that does bring up a very good question,

2      Mr. Nichols, and -- and that is the issue of lawsuits.

3      And -- every time I ask this question, everybody's hand

4      flies in the air, so I'll see if it's any different.           Who

5      thinks there's too many lawsuits?

6                  Okay.   Everybody, of course, always.

7                  Now, does anybody think -- and there are a lot of

8      lawsuits.    But does anybody think that because we're here in

9      this courtroom today on the case that we've described to you

10     today that your belief that there's too many lawsuits starts

11     you out leaning one way or another?        Does anybody feel that,

12     listen, it doesn't matter what the evidence says, there's

13     too many lawsuits, and I think it's going to influence my

14     thinking and decision-making in this case?         Important

15     question.

16                 Okay.   I appreciate it.     Thank you very much for

17     that.   I don't see any hands.

18                 Now, one of the things that His Honor mentioned is

19     the burden of proof.      And I don't know -- everybody's heard

20     about the burden of proof in various cases, and in a civil

21     case like this, one of the unique things is that there's

22     really two burdens of proof.

23                 One burden of proof -- proof is what's -- what's

24     called the preponderance of the evidence.         And what that

25     burden of proof means is that the evidence in favor of a
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 51 of 114 PageID #: 45253

51  




1      proposition has to tip the scales ever so slightly.           And if

2      the evidence tips ever so slightly in favor of one

3      proposition or one claim, that that's all you have to do to

4      satisfy your burden.

5                  So to use a football analogy, in order to satisfy

6      the preponderance of the evidence standard, all you got to

7      do is get the ball over the 50-yard line.         If you get it to

8      the 51-yard line, that's preponderance of the evidence.

9                  Another burden of proof in this case is called

10     clear and convincing evidence -- oh, and by the way, the

11     preponderance standard that I just described, the 51-yard

12     line, that's what Intellectual Ventures has to prove, that's

13     the amount of evidence that they have to bring to show

14     patent infringement, to -- to meet their burden for their

15     claims.

16                 The other standard is preponderance of the

17     evidence -- I'm sorry, clear and convincing evidence.           And

18     that is a higher burden.      That burden is more akin to

19     getting the ball close to the goal line, into the red zone.

20                 THE COURT:    Let's get to a question, Mr. Davis.

21                 MR. DAVIS:    Yes, Your Honor.

22                 Does anybody have a problem with the fact that

23     maybe -- and -- and Intellectual Ventures, we've said their

24     burden, FedEx's burden to prove that these patents are no

25     good is clear and convincing.       Does anybody think that the
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 52 of 114 PageID #: 45254

52  




1      fact that we have two different burdens in this case is

2      unfair in any way or shouldn't -- you know, they don't think

3      they can follow the Court's instructions to apply different

4      burdens of proof?

5                  I know that was a lengthy explanation, but does

6      anybody feel that, you know, look, if you're going to take

7      away somebody's patent rights, you have to meet a higher

8      burden, that that's somehow unfair?

9                  I don't -- I don't see any hands, okay, thank you.

10                 Who -- who here feels like they are the fix-it

11     person?   And by that, I mean if somebody's got a problem,

12     something's broken, a computer device is broken or something

13     is broken, you -- you're the person that people bring it to

14     to fix?

15                 All right.    Thank you.

16                 Let me see, Mr. Fischer, so you're -- you're the

17     fix-it person?

18                 JUROR FISCHER:    In my neighborhood.

19                 MR. DAVIS:    Okay.   What kinds of things do they

20     bring you to fix?

21                 JUROR FISCHER:    Computers, you name it.       Anything

22     electronics pretty much.

23                 MR. DAVIS:    More on the computer side, though?

24                 JUROR FISCHER:    Yes, sir.

25                 MR. DAVIS:    All right.    You pretty good at fixing

53  




1      things?

2                  JUROR FISCHER:    Apparently.

3                  MR. DAVIS:    All right.     Thank you, sir.      I

4      appreciate it.

5                  I saw another hand.       Was that Ms. Carter?

6                  JUROR CARTER:    Yes.

7                  MR. DAVIS:    Okay.   Thank you.     You're the --

8      you're a fix-it person, as well?

9                  JUROR CARTER:    Not necessarily of products.

10                 MR. DAVIS:    Sure.

11                 JUROR CARTER:    But in my family, everybody comes

12     to me.

13                 MR. DAVIS:    Any problem, you're the one to fix it?

14                 JUROR CARTER:    That's right.

15                 MR. DAVIS:    All right.    And that can be technical

16     or it can be anything.

17                 JUROR CARTER:    It could be anything around the

18     house.    It could be a problem you have money wise, anything

19     else.

20                 MR. DAVIS:    Okay.

21                 JUROR CARTER:    If there's a problem, it always

22     comes through me.

23                 MR. DAVIS:    So you must be a good problem solver.

24                 JUROR CARTER:    I don't know, but I do a lot of it.

25                 MR. DAVIS:    Okay.     All right.   All right.       Thank

1      you.

2                  And I saw, yes, sir, Mr. Nichols?

3                  JUROR NICHOLS:     Yes, sir, I'm a -- I do real

4      property maintenance so, therefore, I deal with electrical,

5      the AC, plumbing, carpentry work, I fix it all.

6                  MR. DAVIS:     All right.    You've got a -- if there's

7      a problem, you fix everything?

8                  JUROR NICHOLS:     That's correct.

9                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.    Thank you, sir.

10                 Any other -- any other hands?

11                 Yes, ma'am, Ms. Savio, did I say that right?

12                 JUROR SAVIO:     Yes, sir.

13                 In my line of duty, I'm the policy and procedure

14     expert with community care services eligibility for the

15     State of Texas.     So in my role, anybody that has issues,

16     concerns, problems, whether it be computer not working,

17     complaints, they all come through me.

18                 MR. DAVIS:     Okay.    And so you -- you just -- you

19     manage people in your job, is that what --

20                 JUROR SAVIO:     I manage people, yes.

21                 MR. DAVIS:     And manage --

22                 JUROR SAVIO:     And issues.

23                 MR. DAVIS:     Managing people present some problems

24     and you've got to fix them?

25                 JUROR SAVIO:     Yes.

1                   MR. DAVIS:     All right.

2                   JUROR SAVIO:     Anytime you work with the public,

3      you've got issues.

4                   MR. DAVIS:     Yes, ma'am.   I appreciate it.     Thank

5      you.

6                   Yes, sir, Mr. -- Mr. Means again?

7                   JUROR MEANS:     I was a data processing manager,

8      yeah, you're faced with a lot of different things.           Got a

9      computer science degree, so yeah, I get a lot of computer

10     questions and fix computers and different things.           My wife

11     thinks I can do anything computer-related.

12                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.   Thank you, sir.

13                  Anybody else have anything to say about this

14     question?

15                  Yes, sir, Mr. Thomas?

16                  JUROR THOMAS:     As I said, tire and lube tech, oil

17     work, so I fix, you know, vehicles when they come in for the

18     most part.     And then my off time, I also work on the

19     machines around the house.

20                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.   What machines are those?

21                  JUROR THOMAS:     Well, I -- my own vehicles.     I have

22     two cars -- or I have a car and a truck that I both -- both

23     of them I built.     And any machines that are -- my family

24     needs fixed, I usually fix those, too.

25                  MR. DAVIS:     And when you were --

1                  THE COURT:    You have three minutes, Mr. Davis.

2                  MR. DAVIS:    Thank you, Your Honor.

3                  When you're fixing those things, are you just

4      naturally inclined to fix them, or do you -- do you go study

5      the manuals and the literature?

6                  JUROR THOMAS:     I do a lot of research before I fix

7      anything.

8                  MR. DAVIS:    Okay.    All right.    Thank you, sir.    I

9      appreciate it.

10                 Final question, is there something that, you know,

11     you have been wanting me to ask throughout this whole

12     process, just that one question, you know, if Mr. Davis had

13     only asked me this question, I really think I've got

14     something that needs to be known or about maybe one way or

15     another that I'm leaning in this case?          Is there anybody

16     that has something like that that they feel like I need to

17     hear before I sit down?

18                 Thank you, sir.      I think I -- I think I've gotten

19     everything I need from you.       But I understand.     I

20     understand.

21                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      Okay.

22                 MR. DAVIS:    Thank you, sir.

23                 Anybody else?

24                 Okay.   All right.     I very -- I appreciate it very

25     much.   Thank you for coming today.       Thank you for showing

1      up.     We look forward to presenting our case to you.        To

2      those of you that are selected for the jury, thank you.

3                   THE COURT:     All right.   Mr. Findlay, you may

4      address the panel on behalf of the Defendants.

5                   MR. FINDLAY:     Thank you, Your Honor.    May I have a

6      five-minute warning, Your Honor?

7                   THE COURT:     Yes, you may.

8                   MR. FINDLAY:     Thank you, sir.

9                   May it please the Court.

10                  THE COURT:     Proceed.

11                  MR. FINDLAY:     Ladies and gentlemen, good morning

12     again.

13                  My name is Eric Findlay, and I am proud -- very

14     proud to represent the FedEx Defendants.         There are a number

15     of different FedEx companies that were sued in this lawsuit.

16     You'll hear about them more later on individually.           But just

17     for ease of purposes, I'm going to refer to them as the

18     FedEx Defendants.     And like I said, I'm proud to represent

19     them.

20                  And as Mr. Davis did, I want to give you a brief,

21     short overview of our opinion of this case, what we think

22     this case is about and what we think we will show you.

23                  I think everybody had heard of FedEx.       Some of you

24     may not know the story of how FedEx started, but it really

25     is a great American success story.

1                  FedEx was started back in the early 1970s by

2      Mr. Fred Smith.     He had the idea for it when he was in

3      college.    After getting back from a couple tours of duty in

4      Vietnam where he was a Marine, he gave birth to this idea,

5      bought planes, bought trucks, started this delivery service.

6      You'll hear more about it more in this case, but it really

7      is an amazing and fantastic American success story.

8                  From those beginnings back in the '70s, FedEx has

9      grown into a worldwide package and delivery service.           They

10     have several hundreds of thousands of employees and -- and

11     team members.     And you'll hear more about that, and Mr. Grus

12     is the corporate representative that will be here all

13     throughout trial.     He'll tell you more about the companies

14     and his experience with them.

15                 The one thing that I did agree with Mr. Davis

16     on -- my good friend, Mr. Davis, when he said that we will

17     tell you we don't infringe and we think these patents are

18     invalid, that's absolutely right.        Ladies and gentlemen, we

19     will show you evidence which we believe will prove we do not

20     infringe any one of the four patents Mr. Davis was referring

21     to.

22                 We do it a different way.      We do it the FedEx way,

23     not the Intellectual Ventures way, if you will.          I want to

24     say that again because I think it's important.          We do it our

25     way, and I think the evidence will prove that to you.
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 59 of 114 PageID #: 45261

59  




1                   And, yes, as Mr. Davis indicated, we do think

2      these patents are invalid.       And you'll hear a lot more about

3      that through the course of the trial.         But you may remember

4      the patent video that you watched talked about how when a

5      defendant is accused of patent infringement, they have a

6      right to argue that the patent is invalid.

7                   We will show you what the patent video talked

8      about as prior art that was doing the things the patent

9      claims to be doing -- the patents claim to be doing before.

10     They were doing it first.

11                  And as I think the Judge will instruct you, if it

12     isn't new -- if the patent wasn't new -- if it wasn't first

13     in what it was doing, it's not a valid patent and shouldn't

14     have been granted.     And we will show you that sort of prior

15     art.   Some of it will be Fed Express prior art.         And we'll

16     show you that the Patent Office didn't have that prior art

17     at the time.

18                  So those will be some of the things that we will

19     show you through the course of this lawsuit.

20                  And I want to start out a little bit by thanking

21     you for being here, very much for taking the time out of

22     your day.     I know a lot of you have some -- everybody's got

23     a place they'd probably rather be than right here in jury

24     service.     But as Judge Gilstrap said, we greatly appreciate

25     your time.     It's a high calling to be here.       And without

1      y'all, none of this works.       So on behalf of the team that

2      I'm privileged to work with and the client I'm honored to

3      represent, thank you.

4                   As Mr. Davis did, too, let me just give you a

5      little bit of background about myself.         I live and work in

6      Tyler.     Like Judge Gilstrap, I was not born here in Texas.

7      I'll confess that, but I tried to get here as quickly as I

8      could.     I have two sons.   One is 21 and one is 17, senior in

9      college, senior in high school.        My wife and I have been

10     married for 27 years in about two weeks.         I have an -- main

11     office is in Tyler, and we have an office here in Marshall,

12     as well.

13                  Who remembers the radio talk show guy Paul Harvey?

14     Who's old enough to remember that?        A lot of hands.     Okay.

15     And you remember what he would always say?         He would tell a

16     story -- he'd introduce it, and then he would say:           But now

17     you're going to know -- what did he say?         The rest of the

18     story.

19                  I -- I raise that because we have to go second

20     every time, ladies and gentlemen.        IV has the burden of

21     proof.     Mr. Davis or other lawyers from IV, they'll stand up

22     first, and then we'll follow, just like has happened here.

23                  Can I get a show of hands that everyone will hold

24     judgment, they'll hold their thinking on it until they hear

25     our side of the story, they hear the rest of the story like
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 61 of 114 PageID #: 45263

61  




1      Paul Harvey talked about?       Could I get a show of hands if

2      you'll commit to do that?       Can you understand why that's

3      important to us, that -- that you'll wait to hear the whole

4      story?

5                  Let me ask you a -- kind of a related question.

6      This, obviously, is a formal setting.         We're in a United

7      States District Federal Court, which is a -- a big deal.

8      But as the Judge has instructed, y'all make the decision on

9      infringement in this case, and y'all are going to make the

10     decision on invalidity.

11                 But is there anybody who's sitting there thinking,

12     you know what, the fact that we're here, the fact that we're

13     even doing this, FedEx must have done something wrong,

14     otherwise we wouldn't be here?       Does anybody have that

15     thought?    If you do, would you raise your hand for me?

16     Nobody?    Thank you.

17                 Mr. Davis asked you some questions about FedEx,

18     and I want to follow up on those.        A number of you had

19     positive things to say about FedEx, which, obviously, makes

20     us feel good about the work that we're doing.

21                 Anybody, though, have a negative feeling about

22     FedEx or has had a negative experience about FedEx?           I think

23     a couple of hands.

24                 No. 16, Mr. Belcher.     Can you tell us about that,

25     sir, please?

1                  JUROR BELCHER:     Just their -- the overnight thing,

2      supposed to be overnight, not two days later.

3                  MR. FINDLAY:     Oh, so just didn't get it to you on

4      time?

5                  JUROR BELCHER:      Yeah, about it.

6                  MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.   Let me -- while I've got you

7      here, can I ask you another question?

8                  JUROR BELCHER:     Yeah.

9                  MR. FINDLAY:     You were -- gave some honest answers

10     on the questionnaires, and we appreciate everybody doing

11     that.   But you had some negative impressions of some big

12     corporations.

13                 JUROR BELCHER:     Yeah.

14                 MR. FINDLAY:     Can you tell us about that?

15                 JUROR BELCHER:     I was working for a drilling

16     company.    I was a pipe welder -- pipe welder --

17                 MR. FINDLAY:     Yes, sir.

18                 JUROR BELCHER:     -- for a drilling company, and

19     there's a bunch of them that took off a little early and

20     they docked me three hours for taking off and I didn't go

21     nowhere.

22                 MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.   Was that the -- was that the

23     reason for your comment on --

24                 JUROR BELCHER:      Yeah.

25                 MR. FINDLAY:      -- corporations?
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 63 of 114 PageID #: 45265

63  




1                  JUROR BELCHER:      Yeah.

2                  MR. FINDLAY:      Okay.     Well, obviously, FedEx -- I

3      think we'd all agree FedEx is a big corporation, right?

4                  JUROR BELCHER:     Yeah.

5                  MR. FINDLAY:     Do we start kind of behind,

6      Mr. Belcher, because of that experience --

7                  JUROR BELCHER:     No.

8                  MR. FINDLAY:     -- that you had with that drilling

9      company?

10                 JUROR BELCHER:     No.     Stuff happens, I guess.

11                 MR. FINDLAY:      Okay.     You -- you think you could

12     set that aside and we'd start on a fair playing field, or

13     are we going to start a little bit behind because of your

14     feelings of --

15                 JUROR BELCHER:     No, that's -- that's good.

16                 MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.    Thank you, sir.   I appreciate

17     that.

18                 There was somebody else that I think raised their

19     hand.

20                 THE COURT:     And let me remind everybody on the

21     panel, it's very important that the lawyer and the panel

22     member not talk at the same time.         The court reporter can't

23     write two people talking at one time.          So to keep the record

24     straight, make sure they finish with the question before you

25     answer, and I promise you, they'll make sure your answer is

1      finished before they ask the next question.

2                  MR. FINDLAY:    Apologize, Your Honor.

3                  THE COURT:     Go ahead, Mr. Smith.

4                  MR. FINDLAY:     Mr. Smith.

5                  JUROR SMITH:     Okay.   Back in -- back in the '70s,

6      I got a package shipped from Florida to my house right

7      outside of Marshall.       It still hasn't arrived.     That's not

8      good in my opinion.

9                  MR. FINDLAY:    It didn't -- it didn't absolutely

10     positively didn't get there overnight, did it?

11                 JUROR SMITH:    It didn't get there overnight, no,

12     sir, not hardly.     And just in the last year, you know, I had

13     packages shipped, track them.        They're -- according to their

14     tracking, they have tried to deliver these packages.           My

15     wife stays at home pretty much all the time.          There's no --

16     no -- nobody ever come to the door and tried to deliver

17     anything.

18                 MR. FINDLAY:    Understood.

19                 JUROR SMITH:    I've had a few difficulties with

20     FedEx, but, you know, 98 percent of the -- the encounters

21     I've had with them have been positive.

22                 MR. FINDLAY:    98 percent is a pretty good average.

23                 JUROR SMITH:    Yes, it is, but I get quite a few

24     packages.

25                 MR. FINDLAY:    Thank you, sir.     I appreciate that.

1                  Anybody else?    Any particular negative or bad

2      experience with FedEx?      No other hands.     Thank you very

3      much.

4                  Does anybody know Mr. Davis -- William Davis, one

5      of the lawyers that you heard from?        And he has several

6      other lawyers in his firm who are more local.          A gentleman

7      named Christian Hurt.      Mr. Hurt, are you in the courtroom?

8      Anybody know Mr. Hurt?      Recognize him?

9                  And Mr. Edward Chin -- name doesn't ring a bell?

10                 And I don't think anybody would know, but Mr. Alan

11     De -- Alan Kellman, excuse me, with the Desmarais firm up in

12     New York?    Anybody recognize any of the lawyers on that

13     side?   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

14                 We asked in the questionnaire a question:         Had

15     anybody ever had something taken from them, an idea or

16     something taken from them?       And I think -- I don't think

17     there were many yes answers.       I don't think there were any,

18     in fact.    I want to ask kind of a corollary to that

19     question, or flip it around.

20                 Has anybody ever had the experience where they

21     were accused of doing something wrong or doing something bad

22     that they didn't do?      Anybody ever feel they've been wrongly

23     accused of something?      It could be a car accident.       It could

24     be in school.    It could be anything.       Any show of hands?

25     I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mr. Nichols, wasn't it?

1                  JUROR NICHOLS:     Too numerous to mention.

2                  MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.   Well, let me, if I could just

3      dwell on that for a second or follow up on that.

4                  In one of those situations, if you can remember in

5      your mind, when you're accused of something you didn't do,

6      how did that make you feel?

7                  JUROR NICHOLS:     Real bad.

8                  MR. FINDLAY:     Did you defend yourself and fight

9      back against those accusations or those claims that weren't

10     true?

11                 JUROR NICHOLS:     Well, no, not when I was younger.

12     I would get it any worse.       But as I got older, yes.

13                 MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.   Thank you, Mr. Nichols.

14                 I -- I raised that, ladies and gentlemen, because

15     that's kind of the position that FedEx believes it's in,

16     where we're accused of doing something -- infringing these

17     patents, for instance, that we didn't do.

18                 And so we will aggressively and vigorously, as the

19     Court talked about in our adversarial system, fight back

20     against those accusations because we don't believe they're

21     true, because we believe they're false allegations.

22                 Does anybody think that we don't have a right to

23     do that or that we shouldn't fight back if we don't think

24     we've done anything wrong?       Does everybody -- other side of

25     that, does everybody agree that that's an appropriate thing

1      to do?   If you don't think you've done something wrong, you

2      have the right to stand up for yourself and fight back?

3                  I see people nodding their heads.        Thank you very

4      much.

5                  In the patent video that you saw, it talked about

6      -- and I mentioned this earlier -- that one of the defenses

7      to a patent infringement case is that you think the patent

8      is invalid or the patent shouldn't have been granted.

9                  Does anybody think that, I don't care whatever

10     sort of evidence you bring us, Mr. Findlay, since the Patent

11     Office already granted the patents, I don't think I could

12     ever conclude that they shouldn't have done that or that a

13     mistake was made or that the patents are invalid?           Does

14     anybody believe that, that they just couldn't invalidate a

15     patent, couldn't find it to be a bad patent, regardless of

16     how much evidence is presented?

17                 I don't see any hands.      Well, thank you.

18                 Did any -- did y'all enjoy the patent video?           Have

19     you learned something from it, you think, that you didn't

20     know before?

21                 Would anybody be willing to -- I always pick on a

22     volunteer or pick somebody or ask if there is a volunteer,

23     would somebody be willing to share something about the

24     patent system that they learned from that video that they

25     thought was interesting that they didn't know before they

1      got here this morning?       Anybody willing to do that?

2                  How about -- I'm going to pick on somebody.

3                  Ms. Spiker?

4                  JUROR SPIKER:    Sure.

5                  MR. FINDLAY:    You're a professor; is that correct?

6      Was there anything in the patent video that you learned that

7      you thought was particularly interesting that maybe you

8      didn't know before?

9                  JUROR SPIKER:     I'm vaguely familiar with the

10     processes that were involved in the patent process, but

11     learning some of the specific terms like "prior art" and

12     finding vocabulary to tie to those concepts that I've kind

13     of known about --

14                 MR. FINDLAY:     Uh-huh.

15                 THE COURT:     Ms. Spiker, would you please stand up.

16                 JUROR SPIKER:     Oh, yes.

17                 So becoming more concrete in some of that

18     vocabulary was what I learned from that video.

19                 MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.    And can you tell us while

20     I've got you up a little bit more about the sort of teaching

21     that you do at the university?

22                 JUROR SPIKER:    So I teach philosophy and ethics,

23     as well as government and speech, at two different colleges.

24     Full-time at North East Texas Community College.          So I teach

25     students to critically think to examine evidence to make

1      decisions based upon what's available and to evaluate

2      arguments.

3                   MR. FINDLAY:    What -- can you tell us a little bit

4      more about the ethics teaching?

5                   JUROR SPIKER:    I teach introduction to ethics, so

6      we teach ethical values.       We teach them to examine their own

7      value system.    We have them evaluate their attention scores

8      within their beliefs to figure out more of what they believe

9      and create a philosophy of life and an ethical perspective

10     that they can take outside of the classroom.

11                  MR. FINDLAY:    That's great.    Thank you for sharing

12     that with us.

13                  I want to talk a little bit about damages.

14                  You heard Mr. Davis talk about the amount of

15     damages that they're going to ask for.

16                  As I mentioned, it's our position in this case,

17     ladies and gentlemen, that we don't infringe.          And we

18     believe we will prove that to you.        And it's our position

19     that these patents weren't first.        They weren't new.      So

20     they shouldn't have been granted.

21                  Put we will also respond to the damages

22     allegations for several reasons.        One, it's really the only

23     opportunity we have to rebut or push back against those

24     claims that Intellectual Ventures is going to make.             And,

25     two, as I think it was Mr. Nichols indicated, he thought

1      that was a large amount of money.        I -- we obviously agree

2      with that.     We think that even if you were to disagree with

3      us and find that the patents were infringed and valid, we

4      think that's way too much money.

5                   Now, when I have finished trials sometimes, and

6      I've had the opportunity to speak with jurors, once in a

7      while, I've been told, you know, Mr. Findlay, you said you

8      didn't infringe, then you said the patent was invalid, but

9      then you still talked about money, you still talked about

10     damages.     So I thought you were kind of talking out of both

11     sides of your mouth.      Why would you mention damages if you

12     didn't do anything wrong?

13                  Does anybody feel like that a little bit, that if

14     we respond to their damages claim, that we're somehow

15     saying, maybe we think we did something wrong or did

16     something that we shouldn't have done?

17                  Let me -- let me see if I can use an analogy.

18                  Who's -- has anybody ever been in a car accident

19     where it was not your fault?        Let me see a show of hands,

20     and I'm just going to pick on somebody.

21                  Ms. Mitchell, may I pick on you?

22                  JUROR MITCHELL:    Yes.

23                  MR. FINDLAY:   Okay.   Would you hand her the

24     microphone?

25                  Thank you.

1                   You were involved in a car accident, and you're

2      convinced it was not your fault, correct?

3                   JUROR MITCHELL:    Yes, sir.

4                   MR. FINDLAY:   Did a lawsuit arise from that?

5                   JUROR MITCHELL:    We're in it now.

6                   MR. FINDLAY:   Okay.

7                   JUROR MITCHELL:    I was just thinking about that,

8      too, so...

9                   MR. FINDLAY:   Okay.      Well, let me -- that -- that

10     makes it timely so maybe this will -- maybe this will work.

11                  You're obviously going to fight back and say that

12     you weren't at fault in that accident, correct?

13                  JUROR MITCHELL:    Yes, sir.

14                  MR. FINDLAY:   Okay.   If in that lawsuit,

15     hypothetically, they were to present you, you know, with

16     a -- with a bill for damages for $100,000.00 to repair the

17     car, even though you weren't at fault in the accident, would

18     you also want to fight back and say, hey, that damages

19     amount is -- is crazy?

20                  JUROR MITCHELL:    Yes.

21                  MR. FINDLAY:   And so does that kind of give you a

22     little bit of an understanding of why you'll hear us push

23     back and fight about damages?

24                  JUROR MITCHELL:    Yes, sir.

25                  MR. FINDLAY:   Okay.   Thank you, ma'am, very much

1      for sharing that with us.

2                  Let me now turn, if I could, some individual

3      questions I wanted to ask of some folks.

4                  Mr. Dorman?

5                  JUROR DORMAN:    Yes.

6                  MR. FINDLAY:    Thank you.

7                  You indicated in your jury questionnaire, it

8      sounds like you've been on a number of juries?

9                  JUROR DORMAN:    Yes.

10                 MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.   And I think you -- you were

11     very honest and forthright, and we really do appreciate

12     that, saying you thought maybe it's time for somebody else

13     to serve, not me to serve.

14                 JUROR DORMAN:    Correct.

15                 MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.   And like the Judge indicated,

16     we do appreciate your service.       But if you were chosen in

17     this case, do you think you could still be fair and

18     open-minded, or would that feeling kind of --

19                 JUROR DORMAN:    No, I'd still be fair and

20     open-minded.

21                 MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.   Thank you, sir.

22                 Ms. -- let's see, Ms. Lusk, Juror No. 25, are

23     you -- thank you, ma'am.

24                 You had an interesting answer to one of the

25     questions about somebody that you knew with patents.

1                  JUROR SMITH:    Yes, sir.

2                  MR. FINDLAY:    It was a Dr. Eugene Guthrie.

3                  JUROR LUSK:    That's correct.

4                  MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.    And what is -- what do you

5      know about his patents or the patents he tried to get and

6      that sort of thing?

7                  JUROR LUSK:    He was a medical doctor

8      gastroenterologist, and he retired from practice and started

9      working on patents.       And he's worked with people to get

10     patents in the past -- he's now deceased.          He -- in -- in

11     the emergency rooms, I forgot the name of the medication,

12     there's a medication that -- that all doctors and nurses use

13     to help with the salmonella, to help rid of that germ.           And

14     so helped -- he helped get that patent.

15                 MR. FINDLAY:    So -- so these were things that he

16     invented himself?

17                 JUROR LUSK:     Yes.     Some things that he had worked

18     on with -- with colleagues or he got for himself.           And there

19     were some -- there were several that he got earlier on in

20     his life that had to do with children and helping out with

21     their lungs and stuff.      I don't know the names of all of

22     those drugs.

23                 MR. FINDLAY:    You know, was he ever involved in

24     patent litigation like we are here today?

25                 JUROR LUSK:    Yes, he was.

74  




1                   MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.    Does that experience or

2      knowing him and that he was involved in patent litigation,

3      does that influence your thinking any way today, Ms. Lusk.

4                   JUROR LUSK:    No, not at all.    And he -- he was a

5      relative of my husband's, and so he would hear about it when

6      we would go and visit, you know, periodically and things of

7      that nature, but, no, it -- it would not have any impact on

8      me.

9                   MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.    Thank you, ma'am.

10                  Mr. Anderson, could I ask you a question, sir?

11     Thank you.     You said -- when we first saw your

12     questionnaire, you worked for UPS for 30 years, some of the

13     FedEx guys said, uh-oh, it's the competition.          He's not

14     going to like us.     But you seem to have a positive

15     impression of Federal Express, as well as your own former

16     employer; is that correct?

17                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:        Well, we all -- we all

18     was just doing the same thing.        We weren't competitors

19     because I found that there was enough for everybody.

20                  MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.    Good -- good answer.

21                  And what did you do for UPS, sir?

22                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:      Package driver.

23                  MR. FINDLAY:    Package driver?

24                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:      (Nods head affirmatively.)

25                  MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.    All right.   Thank you, sir.

1                  Mr. -- Mr. Fischer, can I ask you another

2      question, sir?     You had indicated in your questionnaire to

3      us -- and, again, thank you -- that you knew -- either you

4      or somebody had invented something, an automotive filter

5      wrench, and they applied for a patent; is that right?

6                  JUROR FISCHER:     Yes, sir, that's me.

7                  MR. FINDLAY:     That was you?

8                  JUROR FISCHER:     Yes, sir.

9                  MR. FINDLAY:     Can you tell us what that process

10     was, what the invention was, and what happened?

11                 JUROR FISCHER:     Well, I -- I owned a -- I changed

12     my own oil back in the '80s -- early '80s right after I got

13     out of high school.      And I had a Subaru that the oil filter

14     was almost impossible to get to, so I invented my own oil

15     filter wrench that worked very well.         Ed Baker actually

16     manufactured it for me over here, applied for a patent out

17     of Shreveport, spent a lot of money trying to get a patent.

18                 MR. FINDLAY:     Yeah.

19                 JUROR FISCHER:     Gave up on that lawyer, went to

20     one in Dallas.     He -- he did the same thing, same process.

21     The Patent Office sent back several pictures of devices that

22     weren't even close, but they said that's what was keeping me

23     from getting a patent.

24                 MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.

25                 THE COURT:     Mr. Fischer, hold the mic a little

76  




1      closer, please, sir.

2                  JUROR FISCHER:     Okay.    So at that point he wanted

3      more money to continue the patent process, and at that time,

4      I was just out of high school and I had no money and had to

5      give up the --

6                  MR. FINDLAY:     Does that experience tend to lean

7      you one way or the other in favor of IV or in favor of

8      FedEx?   Does it influence you at all?

9                  JUROR FISCHER:     Not at all.

10                 MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.     All right.   Thank you, sir.

11                 Mr. Quinlin (sic).       Hi, sir.    Can I ask you -- you

12     had indicated in your questionnaire that you had a friend or

13     somebody that worked in a -- or knew -- I think your

14     significant other knew somebody that works in a patent law

15     firm down in Houston; is that right?

16                 JUROR QUILLIN:     I can't remember.

17                 MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.     That doesn't ring a bell?

18                 JUROR QUILLIN:     No.

19                 MR. FINDLAY:      Okay.     Thank you, sir.   I might

20     have had it mistaken.

21                 Ms. Satterwhite, could I ask you a question?

22     Juror No. 13.    Thank you.     I think you indicated you worked

23     for Brookshires; is that right?

24                 JUROR SATTERWHITE:       Yes, sir.

25                 MR. FINDLAY:     And there was something in your

1      questionnaire about working in the scanning room which

2      piqued our interest because you'll see things about scanning

3      barcodes in this case and stuff like that.           Can you tell us

4      a little bit more about what you do in the scanning room?

5                  JUROR SATTERWHITE:       I change prices, hang tags, I

6      take out -- I do deal with -- they send me tags.

7                  MR. FINDLAY:     I'm sorry, they do what?

8                  JUROR SATTERWHITE:       They send my tags to me.

9                  MR. FINDLAY:     Okay.

10                 JUROR SATTERWHITE:        I don't get them -- the right

11     day.

12                 MR. FINDLAY:     They send you the tags?

13                 JUROR SATTERWHITE:       Yeah.

14                 MR. FINDLAY:     Understood.     And is that generally a

15     good experience with FedEx, bad experience, or --

16                 JUROR SATTERWHITE:       So far it's been good.

17                 MR. FINDLAY:     So far, so good.       And how long have

18     you work there, ma'am?

19                 JUROR SATTERWHITE:        Four years.

20                 MR. FINDLAY:      Okay.     Thank you very much.

21                 Mr. Dement, may I pick on you, sir?         You indicated

22     I think that you used to work for a company that had some IP

23     or intellectual property or patents.          Who is that, sir?

24                 THE COURT:     And you have five minutes remaining,

25     Mr. Findlay.

1                  MR. FINDLAY:    Thank you, Your Honor.

2                  JUROR DEMENT:    Texas Eastman.

3                  MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.   Were you -- do you know if

4      they were ever involved in lawsuits?

5                  JUROR DEMENT:    Yes, I do know they were, but I

6      don't know what they were about.

7                  MR. FINDLAY:    Did you have any role in them or

8      anything?

9                  JUROR DEMENT:    We made one product with -- what's

10     that fabric softener, Downy?

11                 MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.

12                 JUROR DEMENT:    That -- they found out that there

13     was something that we were doing wrong.

14                 MR. FINDLAY:    All right.

15                 JUROR DEMENT:    I don't -- I don't really know what

16     it was.   I know that we quit making whatever it was.

17                 MR. FINDLAY:    Any impact at all on what your

18     thinking would be --

19                 JUROR DEMENT:    No.

20                 MR. FINDLAY:     -- if you were picked on the jury

21     in this case?

22                 JUROR DEMENT:    None whatsoever.

23                 MR. FINDLAY:    Okay.   Thank you, sir.

24                 Ladies and gentlemen, I think I'm going to give

25     you a little bit of your time back.        But I'm going to end,

1      as Mr. Davis did, asking is there anything you think I

2      haven't asked, or is there anything as you're sitting there,

3      you're dying to say or you think we would want to know about

4      you and your position and your thoughts in this case and

5      what you've heard so far?       No show of hands.

6                  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you very much

7      for your attention.      Thank you for taking the time to be

8      here.   We look forward to presenting the case to the eight

9      of you that are selected.

10                 Thank you, Your Honor.

11                 THE COURT:    All right.    Counsel, approach the

12     bench, please.

13                 (Bench conference.)

14                 THE COURT:    Mr. Davis, does the Plaintiff have any

15     challenges for cause?

16                 MR. DAVIS:    Yes, Your Honor, we do.      Juror No. 5,

17     Mr. Anderson; Juror No. 14, Mr. Nichols; and Juror No. 17,

18     Mr. Anderson -- Mr. Leroy Anderson.

19                 THE COURT:    What's your basis for challenging No.

20     5 for cause?

21                 MR. DAVIS:     Your Honor, in his questionnaire, he

22     mentioned the fact that he thought that -- he mentioned the

23     fact that he knew about many patent cases being filed in

24     this district, and he said that the district has an abysmal

25     record in terms of handling patent cases.         And he believes

1      he is biased against patent cases being filed in this

2      district.

3                   THE COURT:     Okay.

4                   MR. DAVIS:     He's not able to follow the evidence.

5                   THE COURT:     All right.   Is that it?   Do you have

6      any other challenges for cause other than those three?

7                   MR. DAVIS:     No, Your Honor.

8                   THE COURT:     Mr. Findlay, do the Defendants have

9      any challenges for cause?

10                  MR. FINDLAY:     No, Your Honor.

11                  THE COURT:     Okay.   We've also got Mr. Dorman,

12     Mr. Leroy Anderson --

13                  MR. DAVIS:     Mr. Rodgers.

14                  THE COURT:      -- and Mr. Danny Joe Rodgers with the

15     scheduling issues.     I'm going to hold these folks back.           Of

16     course, Mr. Leroy Anderson will be held back for the

17     challenge for cause from Plaintiff.           I'll let the rest of

18     the panel take a recess, and then we'll bring these up one

19     at a time and question them here at the bench with you all

20     present.

21                  If you'll take your places, I'll recess the rest

22     of the panel, and then we'll bring these up one at a time,

23     all right?

24                  MR. DAVIS:     Thank you, Your Honor.

25                  MR. FINDLAY:     Thank you, Your Honor.

1                  (Bench conference concluded.)

2                  THE COURT:    Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to let

3      the vast majority of the panel have a recess.          And when you

4      go through the double doors at the back of the courtroom for

5      recess, if you'll turn to the left, you'll find two very

6      important things, the water fountains and the restrooms.

7      I'm going to ask you that while you're on recess, that you

8      stay in the building, that you not exit or go outside.           I'm

9      also going to ask that you talk about grandchildren, the

10     weather, sports, anything you want to talk about, but don't

11     discuss anything that's happened in the courtroom this

12     morning.

13                 And I need to remind you, you haven't heard any

14     evidence at all so far.

15                 Now, when I said I'm going to excuse the majority

16     of the panel for recess, that means there are some of you

17     I'm going to ask to stay in your seats and let me talk with

18     you here at the bench briefly before you join the rest of

19     the panel for recess outside.

20                 So those on the panel that I'm going to ask to

21     stay where you are and as the other exit for recess, you may

22     just have to step out of the way and let them move by and

23     then remain at your same seat -- those are Panel No. --

24     Panel Member No. 5, Mr. Kelly Anderson; No. 6, Mr. Tim

25     Dorman; No. 14, Mr. Nichols; No. 17, Mr. Leroy Anderson; No.

1      20, Mr. Rodgers.

2                  Everyone else except those folks, you are, with

3      those instructions, excused for recess at this time.

4                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

5                  THE COURT:    And, Mr. Thomas, if you'd lead the

6      way, please, sir.

7                  (Venire panel out.)

8                  THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

9                  Counsel, approach the bench.

10                 (Bench conference.)

11                 THE COURT:    Let me ask, counsel, do either of you

12     all have a hard copy of Mr. Anderson's questionnaire?

13                 MR. DAVIS:    Yes, Your Honor.

14                 THE COURT:    I do not have that in front of me, and

15     I want to refer to it.

16                 MR. DAVIS:    Absolutely, Your Honor, on the first

17     page.

18                 THE COURT:    I want whatever you were concerned

19     about, Mr. Davis.

20                 MR. DAVIS:    It's that page, Your Honor, the second

21     page right here.     And these two answers, but primarily this

22     one.

23                 (Open court.)

24                 Mr. Anderson, Mr. Kelly Anderson, if you'd come

25     forward, please, sir?

2                  JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      Your Honor, here or here?

3                  THE COURT:    Come around this way.

4                  Good morning.

5                  JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      Good morning.

6                  THE COURT:    These are our microphones.

7                  JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      Yes, sir.

8                  THE COURT:    We're just going to talk quietly here

9      at the bench.

10                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      Okay.

11                 THE COURT:    Mr. Anderson, in your questionnaire,

12     you gave an answer that said something to the effect that

13     you wondered if this was another patent troll case.

14                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      Yes, sir.

15                 THE COURT:    The cases most often filed in this

16     district have to do with patent trolls and this district has

17     an abysmal record dealing with cases.

18                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      That's 2017.    I think it

19     was over 80 percent of patent cases ran through this

20     district.    After 2017 that changed because of all different

21     venues, but that -- I can go to the blog that --

22                 THE COURT:    What's the name of the blog?

23                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      Slash -- slash..org.

24                 THE COURT:    Okay.

25                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      And they've -- it's

1      reported on the Eastern District several times.

2                  THE COURT:    Well --

3                  JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:       And I'm just --

4                  THE COURT:    Sure.

5                  JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:       And I'm just mentioning it

6      to be honest.

7                  THE COURT:    Sure.     That's what we're here for.

8      And everybody's entitled to the opinion -- to their

9      opinions.

10                 The real question, and the reason I've asked you

11     to come up here is, I need to know, and these parties need

12     to know, that if you're selected for this jury, will those

13     opinions cause you to lean one way or the other before you

14     hear the first witness testify, or can you be completely

15     fair and impartial and put whatever prior opinions and

16     observations and judgments that you've read online or

17     elsewhere out of your mind?

18                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:      No, sir.   I feel there's

19     too much evidence not -- excuse me -- not directly

20     involving -- but just overall, I don't -- I just -- patent

21     cases, because of my opinions on them, and the feelings of

22     trolls, it's not something that I'm comfortable trying to --

23                 THE COURT:    Okay.   In other words, what you're

24     telling me is despite everything else, you don't feel you

25     could be fair and impartial?

1                  JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:       No, sir, I do not feel that

2      way.

3                  THE COURT:     Okay.   Well, I appreciate your candor,

4      Mr. Anderson.

5                  Mr. Davis, do you have any questions?

6                  MR. DAVIS:     No, Your Honor.

7                  THE COURT:     Mr. Findlay?

8                  MR. FINDLAY:    No, Your Honor.

9                  THE COURT:     All right.    Mr. Anderson, I'm going to

10     let you join the rest of the panel outside.          And during the

11     recess, just don't talk about anything that has been said in

12     here.

13                 JUROR KELLY ANDERSON:       Yes, sir.

14                 THE COURT:     Thank you very much.

15                 MR. DAVIS:     Thank you, Your Honor.

16                 (Juror Kelly Anderson leaves the courtroom.)

17                 THE COURT:     All right.    I'm going to excuse No. 5,

18     Mr. Anderson.

19                 (Open court.)

20                 THE COURT:     Mr. Dorman, would you come up?

21                 (Bench conference continued.)

22                 JUROR DORMAN:    Mine's rather simple.      I have a

23     family vacation scheduled.         And we're supposed to fly out of

24     Dallas --

25                 THE COURT:     Just talk quietly to these

2                   JUROR DORMAN:   Fly out of Dallas at 1:00 o'clock

3      Friday.

4                   THE COURT:   Friday of this week?

5                   JUROR DORMAN:   Yeah.     And my whole family is

6      scheduled.     My kids are going and all that, and they've all

7      scheduled their time off work and all that already.

8                   THE COURT:   Where are you going?

9                   JUROR DORMAN:   Denver, Colorado.

10                  THE COURT:   Okay.   Well, I don't see any reason

11     why I should try to interfere with that, Mr. Dorman.

12                  JUROR DORMAN:   Well, I appreciate that.       I've

13     served quite a bit, and I would be willing to do it again if

14     it wasn't for this.

15                  THE COURT:   I understand.    I appreciate your

16     candor.

17                  JUROR DORMAN:   Okay.     Well, I appreciate y'all.

18                  THE COURT:   I'm -- I'm going to ask you to join

19     the rest of the panel outside during recess.          Just don't

20     discuss anything that's been said in here.

21                  JUROR DORMAN:   All right.     Thank y'all.    Thank

22     you, gentlemen.

23                  (Juror Dorman leaves the courtroom.)

24                  THE COURT:   All right.    To clarify on the record,

1      his communications and answers that he can't be fair and

2      impartial.

3                   No. 6, Mr. Tim Dorman, I'm excusing for scheduling

4      problems.    We have more than enough venire members here to

5      select a jury trial.      I don't see any reason that I should

6      interfere with a family wide pre-planned ready-to-go

7      vacation.

8                   Okay.   That brings us to No. 14, Mr. Nichols.

9                   (Open court.)

10                  THE COURT:   Mr. Nichols, would you come up,

11     please, sir?

12                  (Bench conference continued.)

13                  THE COURT:   Good morning, sir.     These are our

14     microphones.    If you and I can just talk quietly here.

15                  Two things, Mr. Nichols.     Number one, you

16     indicated in your answers to questions that regardless of

17     the evidence, you didn't think there was ever any way you

18     could award an amount of damages as high as what the

19     Plaintiff is asking for here.

20                  I assume that's still your feeling, and -- and do

21     you feel like that regardless of the evidence you could

22     never award a sum in that range; is that correct?

23                  JUROR NICHOLS:   Not regardless.     I mean I would

24     have to say it would take a large amount of positive stuff

25     to convince me.      But right as it stands right now, I don't

1      feel there's any possibility they're entitled to that much.

2      I mean, to me, it's just too much.

3                   THE COURT:   Well, that's what I'm trying to

4      determine.    Can -- can you hear the evidence and then

5      decide, or have you already decided that's too much money?

6      I mean, you've said --

7                   JUROR NICHOLS:   All --

8                   THE COURT:   You said --

9                   JUROR NICHOLS:   I'm sorry.

10                  THE COURT:   You said you couldn't ever award that

11     amount when you answered questions.        That sounds to me like

12     you may have made up your mind.        But if -- if that's not the

13     case, you need to tell me.        That's why we're here talking

14     about it.

15                  JUROR NICHOLS:   Well, that -- that may be a slight

16     overstatement.     I -- it would take a lot of convincing.         I

17     may be able to be convinced, but as it stands, I -- that's

18     just a lot of -- lot of money.         I don't feel anything's

19     worth it.    But I could be convinced.

20                  THE COURT:   Okay.    Okay.   But you'd have to be

21     convinced, you would -- you would --

22                  JUROR NICHOLS:   Yes.

23                  THE COURT:   -- not be starting out at a -- at a

24     zero position to go one way, up or down?         You'd be starting

25     out feeling that's too much, somebody would have to move you

1      back the other way to get to zero and then move you beyond

2      that to make an award; is that correct?

3                  JUROR NICHOLS:    Yes, sir.     Show good reasons.

4                  THE COURT:    Okay.   Okay.   And one other thing you

5      said during the questioning, somebody asked if you'd ever --

6      anybody had ever had a bad experience where they thought

7      something that happened to them that shouldn't have, and

8      something they had had been taken from them.

9                  I thought you said that's happened to you more

10     times than you could count.       Tell me what you meant about

11     that.   Or did I misunderstand you?

12                 JUROR NICHOLS:    Part of that taking something away

13     from you, I don't -- I guess I misunderstood that part.            But

14     I've been falsely accused several times.

15                 THE COURT:    Okay.

16                 JUROR NICHOLS:    Both as a child and in adult life.

17     But as far as anything being took away other than --

18                 THE COURT:    So you're just sensitive of being

19     falsely accused?

20                 JUROR NICHOLS:    Right.

21                 THE COURT:    Okay.   I just needed a little

22     clarification.

23                 Mr. Davis, do you have any questions for

24     Mr. Nichols?

25                 MR. DAVIS:    No, Your Honor.

1                   THE COURT:     Mr. Findlay, do you have any

2      questions?

3                   MR. FINDLAY:     Just one or two, Your Honor, if I

4      might.

5                   Mr. Nichols, if you were selected on the jury,

6      the -- Judge Gilstrap's instructions will tell you what the

7      law is.   And when it gets to damages, he'll tell you -- the

8      Judge will instruct you as to what Intellectual Ventures

9      must do to prove they're entitled to damages, and that

10     burden is just a preponderance of the evidence.

11                  Are you -- is it -- do you think you can follow

12     those instructions, or you're saying you can't follow those

13     instructions?

14                  JUROR NICHOLS:     I can follow the instructions, but

15     there has to be a lot of convincing, but yes.

16                  MR. FINDLAY:     Would you --

17                  JUROR NICHOLS:     I -- I understand what you're

18     saying.   I don't know exactly how to go about answering it,

19     but -- other than just -- yes, I can go by the instructions.

20                  MR. FINDLAY:     You'd follow the -- you'd follow the

21     Judge's instructions?

22                  JUROR NICHOLS:     Yes.

23                  THE COURT:     Is it fair to say, Mr. Nichols, that

24     at least on this issue, you would take more convincing there

25     than it would on other issues?         On other issues, you'd be

1      more at a neutral position?

2                   JUROR NICHOLS:     Yes.

3                   THE COURT:     Okay.    Anything -- anything else?

4                   MR. DAVIS:     Nothing other --

5                   MR. FINDLAY:     No, Your Honor.

6                   THE COURT:      Okay.     Mr. Nichols, I'm going to let

7      you join the rest of the group outside.          Just don't discuss

8      anything that we've talked about in here, please?

9                   JUROR NICHOLS:     Yes.

10                  (Juror Nichols leaves the courtroom.)

11                  THE COURT:     Okay.    I'm going to excuse Mr. --

12     Mr. Nichols for cause.

13                  MR. DAVIS:     Okay.

14                  THE COURT:     He's -- he's been very candid, but

15     it's clear that he's not at a neutral position before the

16     evidence is presented.       He's strongly opposed to any large

17     award of damages and will just barely admit -- he might be

18     convinced otherwise, but he's pretty strong in his opinions

19     that he's in a predetermined position, opposed to any

20     monetary award the size Plaintiff's asked for.

21                  Given the number of venire members on the panel

22     and his answers, I think the fair result is to excuse him

23     for cause.    And that's my -- that's my order in regard to

24     Mr.   Nichols.

25                  All right.     Next is Leroy Anderson.

1                  (Open court.)

2                  THE COURT:    Mr. Anderson, would you come up,

3      please, sir?    How are you, Mr. Anderson?

4                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       Just fine.

5                  (Bench conference continued.)

6                  THE COURT:    It's been a long time.

7                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       Yes, sir.

8                  THE COURT:    How is Ms. Anderson?

9                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       Faye is doing fine.

10                 THE COURT:      Tell her I said hello.

11                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       I will.

12                 THE COURT:    Good, good.

13                 During the questioning, you indicated that having

14     the experiences that you had with UPS, you lean toward FedEx

15     in the case.

16                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:      Yes.

17                 THE COURT:    And I appreciate that honesty and that

18     candor.   The question I've got is despite your experiences

19     in the same kind of field as the Defendants in this case,

20     can you treat both sides completely fair and impartially, or

21     are you going to start out with FedEx having an edge in your

22     mind and both the Plaintiff and the Defendants not starting

23     out in the same position?       You just have to tell me.

24                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       Truthfully?

25                 THE COURT:    Truthfully, yes, sir.

1                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:      I like them old UPS guys.

2      We sit here and swap stories and -- and find directions

3      together.

4                  THE COURT:     Okay.

5                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:          I mean, that's the truth.

6                  THE COURT:     And do you think that would cause you

7      to favor the FedEx people?

8                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:          It -- it might.   It very

9      well might.    Yeah -- I mean, yeah.

10                 THE COURT:     Okay.   Let me ask it another way.

11                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:      Okay.

12                 THE COURT:     Are you not a hundred percent sure

13     that it wouldn't cause you to favor them?

14                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:      That's -- that's closer.

15     I'm not a hundred percent sure.

16                 THE COURT:     Okay.   Okay.     I appreciate your

17     answers.

18                 Mr. Davis, do you have any questions of

19     Mr. Anderson?

20                 MR. DAVIS:     Not at this time, Your Honor.

21                 THE COURT:     Mr. Findlay?

22                 MR. FINDLAY:     No, Your Honor.

24     you join the rest of the group outside.          Just don't discuss

1                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       Thank you.

2                  THE COURT:     Thank you very much.

3                  MR. FINDLAY:     Mr. Anderson also had a hardship.

4                  THE COURT:      That's right, he sure did.      Tell me

5      about that, Mr. Anderson.

6                  Thank you, Mr. Findlay.

7                  JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       I've got a cardiologist

8      appointment in the morning at 8:00 o'clock.

9                  THE COURT:      Whereabouts?

10                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       In Tyler.

11                 THE COURT:     How long have you had that

12     appointment?

13                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       About a month.

14                 THE COURT:     Okay.

15                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       Each time we turned it off

16     and rolled it over, it got closer and closer to the

17     appointment in Tyler.

18                 THE COURT:     I appreciate that.    I'm not going to

19     stand between you and your cardiologist.         But you'll just

20     join the rest of the group outside, and don't discuss

21     anything we've talked about in here.

22                 JUROR LEROY ANDERSON:       Okay.

24                 (Juror Leroy Anderson leaves the courtroom.)

1      Leroy Anderson both for his scheduling problem with his

2      cardiologist, an appointment he's had for a month or longer,

3      and for his candid indication that he's not completely sure

4      he can be fair and impartial.

5                  That leaves Mr. Rodgers, No. 20.

6                  (Open court.)

7                  THE COURT:    Mr. Rodgers, would you come up,

8      please?

9                  (Bench conference continued.)

10                 THE COURT:    Good morning, sir.

11                 JUROR RODGERS:    Good morning.

12                 THE COURT:    These are our microphones, if you and

13     I can just talk quietly up here.

14                 You indicated early on that if you were selected,

15     you might have a scheduling problem being here all week and

16     into the beginning of next week.

17                 JUROR RODGERS:    Oh, yeah.

18                 THE COURT:    Can you tell me about that?

19                 JUROR RODGERS:    Well, I've got a project I'm

20     supposed to start this week, a big project as far as -- I do

21     construction, and we already got a bad rap of not showing up

22     on time.    But this has been in the makings for a month,

23     which it's -- to say it's like an $80,000 greenhouse, and

24     they're scheduled -- everybody's scheduled at a certain time

25     to be there.    And I'm already off by being here.        It's

1      supposed to start today.

2                   THE COURT:   Okay.

3                   JUROR RODGERS:   And I'm already -- now -- we

4      supposed to start the concrete process today.          Well, I have

5      to be there --

6                   THE COURT:   Tell me something, Mr. Rodgers, are

7      you the contractor doing the job or --

8                   JUROR RODGERS:   Yes.

9                   THE COURT:   Are you subbing part of it, or what's

10     your role?

11                  JUROR RODGERS:   I'm over the whole -- yeah, they

12     hired me to build the project.

13                  THE COURT:   Okay.

14                  JUROR RODGERS:   But I'm one of those guys -- I

15     don't want you doing nothing unless I'm not there because if

16     it's wrong -- you understand what I'm saying?          In other

17     words, that's just the way I roll.        I mean -- so I'm going

18     to shut the whole project down because it's very critical.

19     The first part of the project would be the concrete to be

20     poured.   And it's just not flat, it's walls up 32 inches.

21     And it -- if -- I'm talking about an eighth of an inch, we

22     can't be doing that.      So it's -- it's real vital that I be

23     there.

24                  THE COURT:   Okay.

25                  JUROR RODGERS:   And my mind wouldn't be on it

1      either, and I feel like my word -- your word these days is

2      if you tell somebody you're going to do something, you

3      should do it, and regardless --

4                  THE COURT:     All right.    So let me make sure I

5      understand this.     Your scheduling problem is related to your

6      work?

7                  JUROR RODGERS:     Yes.

8                  THE COURT:     You don't have any scheduling problems

9      related to a medical thing or other family or something

10     else?

11                 JUROR RODGERS:         Well, this is one thing.

12                 THE COURT:     Okay.

13                 JUROR RODGERS:     I can't sit very long because of

14     back problems.     That's about as long as I can sit.

15                 THE COURT:     Okay.

16                 JUROR RODGERS:         I mean, I'm -- I'm -- my back

17     right now is going in spasms from sitting on that bench over

18     there for that long.

19                 THE COURT:     It's not going to get any softer, I

20     promise you.

21                 MR. FINDLAY:     The chairs are more comfortable

22     there.

23                 JUROR RODGERS:     I understand that.     But anyway,

24     that's -- that's where I'm at.

25                 THE COURT:     Okay.    Have you had back surgeries in

1      the past?

2                   JUROR RODGERS:     I'm on -- I take pain pills for my

3      back, yes.    I rode bulls all my life.

4                   THE COURT:     Okay.

5                   JUROR RODGERS:     Another story.

6                   THE COURT:     All right.     I'll take your word for

7      that.

8                   Mr. Davis, do you have any questions of

9      Mr. Rodgers?

10                  MR. DAVIS:     No, Your Honor.

11                  THE COURT:     Mr. Findlay?

12                  MR. FINDLAY:     No, I do not, Your Honor.

13                  THE COURT:      Mr. Rodgers, I'm going to let you

14     join the rest of the group outside.          Just don't discuss

15     anything we've talked about in here.

16                  JUROR RODGERS:     Okay.

17                  THE COURT:     Thank you.

18                  (Juror Rodgers leaves the courtroom.)

19                  THE COURT:     Mr. Davis, Mr. Findlay, how do you

20     feel about Mr. Rodgers?       It's not the typical

21     scheduling issue, but he clearly is a small business owner.

22     That would put him in a -- in a difficult posture.

23                  MR. FINDLAY:     I --

24                  THE COURT:     Do either of you object to him being

25     excused?

1                  MR. FINDLAY:     No, Defendants do not object.

2                  THE COURT:     Mr. Davis.

3                  MR. DAVIS:     No, Your Honor, we don't object.

4                  THE COURT:     Then without objection, I'm going to

5      excuse, Mr. Rodgers.

6                  All right.     Those are all the challenges for cause

7      or scheduling problems that I have notes on.

8                  And just to review, Court's excused No. 5, No. 6,

9      No. 14, No. 17, and No. 20.        That's five.   We're going to

10     seat eight jurors.     Each side will get three strikes.        Five

11     and 16 is 21 so we need to strike through 21.

12                 Does anybody see it any differently?

13                 MR. DAVIS:     No, Your Honor, that's correct.

14                 THE COURT:     How long do you all need to strike

15     your lists?

16                 MR. FINDLAY:     15.

17                 MR. DAVIS:      15 is fine.

18                 THE COURT:     It's about seven minutes after 11:00.

19     I'll give you until 20 after, okay?        If you'll have your

20     strike lists in to the courtroom deputy by that time.

21                 MR. DAVIS:     Yes, Your Honor.

22                 MR. FINDLAY:     Yes, Your Honor.

23                 THE COURT:     Thank you.

24                 (Bench conference concluded.)

25                 THE COURT:     All right.   While counsel exercise

1      their peremptory challenges, the Court will stand in recess.

2                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

3                  (Recess.)

4                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

5                  THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

6                  All right.    Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll listen

7      carefully, and if you'll come forward as your name is called

8      and take your place in the jury box, we're going to seat

9      eight jurors in this case.       And I'm going to ask the first

10     four to position themselves on the front row of the jury

11     box, and the second four to position themselves behind the

12     first four on the second row of the jury box.          And so that

13     the jury as a whole is centered in the box because there's

14     something like 14 seats in the box and we have eight people,

15     I'm going to ask Juror No. 1 to stand in front of the third

16     chair from the end and leave two blank chairs past where

17     Juror No. 1 is standing, and the other three -- two, three,

18     and four, will stack up behind Juror No. 1 on the first row

19     and Juror 5, 6, 7, and 8 will stack up behind them on the

20     second row.

21                 So if Juror No. 1 will leave two empty seats past

22     where he or she is standing.        And I'm going to ask eight

23     members of the jury to remaining standing until all eight of

24     you are in the box together.

25                 So with that, Ms. Lockhart, our courtroom deputy,

                                                                                101




1      will call the names of the eight members of our jury.

2                   COURTROOM DEPUTY:    Mary Mitchell, Richard Fischer,

3      Gina Jenkins, Tathona Savio, Janice Carter, Penny

4      Satterwhite, Lyndi Isonhood, and Candita Mathis.

5                   THE COURT:   Thank you.    Please be seated.

6                   Those of you that were not selected on the jury

7      and for the jury in this case, I'm about to excuse you at

8      this time.    But I want to excuse you with the sincere and

9      heartfelt thanks and appreciation of the Court, the Court

10     staff, and the parties, and the lawyers in this case.            All

11     of us in this room recognize that you have performed a very

12     real important public service by being here this morning and

13     presenting yourselves for jury duty, even though you weren't

14     ultimately selected.      And I know without a doubt that every

15     one of you had other places to be this morning that were

16     important in your respective lives and you set those other

17     obligations and responsibilities aside and you came and

18     presented yourself for service on this jury.          And though you

19     weren't selected, you have discharged your obligation as

20     good citizens.     You've done your part this morning to see

21     that our judiciary functions as our founders and the framers

22     of our constitution intended.

23                  And, quite honestly, you have done very important

24     public service and good work this morning, and it deserves

25     to be recognized and called out for the significance that it
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 102 of 114 PageID #: 45304

                                                                                102




1      is.   And thank you each one for being here.

2                   As you leave the courtroom, someone from the --

3      from the clerk's office, probably Ms. Clendening, will be

4      available.    She's going to collect those very valuable tags

5      and buttons that you're wearing.        You don't get to keep

6      those as a souvenir.

7                   She'll also provide you with any kind of

8      documentation you need for your employer or any place to

9      show where you've been this morning.         And she'll answer any

10     other questions that you have about your service this

11     morning as members of the venire panel.

12                  But thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen, for

13     your presence, for your sacrifice, and your willingness to

14     serve.    Those on the jury panel who were not selected on the

15     jury are excused at this time.

16                  COURT SECURITY OFFICER:     All rise.

17                  (Venire panel out.)

18                  THE COURT:   All right.    If everyone but the

19     members of the jury would be seated, please.

20                  At this time, I'm going to ask our courtroom

21     deputy, Ms. Lockhart, to administer the oath to the eight

22     members of the jury.

23                  (Jury sworn.)

24                  THE COURT:   Thank you.    Please be seated.

25                  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm about to

                                                                                103




1      recess for lunch.

2                   I've signed an order -- in anticipation of this

3      trial, ordering the clerk's office to provide lunch to the

4      jury each day that we are in session so you're not going to

5      have to leave and find lunch somewhere else.          You're not

6      going to have to bring lunch.        Lunch will be provided by the

7      Court for you each day.       And you can plan your schedules

8      around that.

9                   Also, before we break for lunch, I think it would

10     be very important if over the lunch break, you would make

11     sure that the clerk's office has a good working cell phone

12     number for you.     In case there were anything to arise after

13     hours or between our sessions when the Court would need to

14     communicate with you, it would be helpful if we had a good

15     cell phone for each of you.       If you'll do that as convenient

16     over the lunch break.

17                  Also, ladies and gentlemen, I have a few

18     instructions that I need to give you.         They're very

19     important.     I'm going to ask that you listen carefully, and

20     after that, we'll be able to break for lunch.

21                  First of all, ladies and gentlemen, do not discuss

22     this case with anyone.      It is -- it is a foundational

23     principle of our judicial system that a jury such as

24     yourselves at the end of all the evidence will be asked to

25     answer certain questions.       Those questions come to you in
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 104 of 114 PageID #: 45306

                                                                                 104




1      what's called the verdict form, and your answers to those

2      questions must be based solely and only on the evidence

3      that's presented in open court, that's given to you under

4      oath from the witness stand and subject to

5      cross-examination.      It is absolutely essential that there be

6      no outside influences, no outside communication, no outside

7      information of any shape, form, or fashion.          And if there

8      is, it jeopardizes the entire process which could in some

9      cases require us to start completely over with a brand new

10     jury.

11                 So based on that fundamental principle that the

12     sole universe of the information you will eventually answer

13     the questions that will be submitted to you must come under

14     oath in open court subject to cross-examination.

15                 With that principle in mind, I'm going to instruct

16     you do not communicate about this case with anyone.              And I

17     can promise you, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to hear

18     that over and over from me.       Probably you're not ever to get

19     out of those chairs that before you stand up, I'm going to

20     say, remember, don't discuss the case with anyone.           I

21     promise you, by the time the trial is over, you're going to

22     be sick and tired of me saying that.         But it's so important,

23     it's so essential, I think it's worth repeating every

24     opportunity.

25                 And when I say don't communicate about the case, I
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 105 of 114 PageID #: 45307

                                                                                105




1      mean don't discuss it with anyone orally.          I mean don't

2      email about it.     I don't -- don't write about it, don't get

3      on the telephone about it.       Those of you that use social

4      media, like Facebook or Twitter, don't post anything on

5      Facebook, don't tweet anything on Twitter, don't use any

6      social media of any type.       Don't communicate with anyone in

7      any way about anything related to this case.

8                  Also, ladies and gentlemen, when I give you that

9      instruction, it also means not to discuss this case among

10     yourselves.     Until all the evidence is in, you are not to

11     communicate among the eight of you about anything that's

12     happened in court.

13                 Now, when all the evidence is complete and I

14     instruct you to retire to the jury room and to deliberate on

15     your verdict, then it will become your duty to discuss the

16     case among yourselves in attempting to reach a unanimous

17     decision about those questions that will be included in the

18     verdict form.

19                 But until all the evidence is in and until I

20     instruct you to retire to the jury room and to deliberate

21     upon your verdict, until that time, my instruction not to

22     communicate in any way about the case means not only with

23     all outside persons and parties, it also means not to

24     communicate about the case between the eight of you on the

25     jury.
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 106 of 114 PageID #: 45308

                                                                                106




1                  Also, ladies and gentlemen, a part of the same

2      fundamental principle that the sole source of the

3      information you will draw upon must come to you through the

4      evidence presented in open court is that you should not

5      attempt to do any research about anything involved in this

6      case.    You should not overnight or during breaks go online

7      and try to do browser searches of any of the parties, any of

8      the lawyers, anything about the case, whatsoever.           Don't --

9      don't pull an old encyclopedia off the shelf at home.            Don't

10     do any research of any kind about anything related to the

11     case.

12                 Again, it all comes back to that one fundamental

13     principle that the sole source of the information that

14     you'll have before you to answer the questions in the

15     verdict form must come as a part of this trial in open court

16     under oath and from the witness stand where it can be

17     subject to cross-examination.

18                 Also, ladies and gentlemen, I don't think it's

19     likely to happen in this case, but I can't tell you that

20     it's beyond the realm of possibility.         And, that is, there's

21     a lot at stake here for both the Plaintiff and the

22     Defendants.     This is an important case, and it's possible

23     that some third party, some outside person could attempt to

24     contact you and communicate with you as a member of this

25     jury to influence your decision in this case.          I don't think
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 107 of 114 PageID #: 45309

                                                                                 107




1      that's likely to happen, but I can't swear to you that it's

2      beyond the realm of possibility.

3                  If that should happen, if anyone of any type

4      approaches you in any way that you feel uncomfortable about

5      that you don't think is quite right, then you should advise

6      Ms. Clendening in the clerk's office immediately.           She'll

7      let me know, and the Court will deal with it.          Again, I

8      don't think it's likely, but I at least want to put -- put

9      you on your guard that that is at least within the realm of

10     possibility.

11                 Finally, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the

12     course of this trial, you're going to be coming in the

13     mornings, leaving in the evenings, on recesses, you'll be

14     moving around.     There'll be times when you will pass by one

15     or more of these lawyers, one or more of the witnesses, one

16     or more of the corporate representatives.          When you pass by

17     or come in close contact with any of these folks involved in

18     this trial, they're not going to speak to you.           They're not

19     going to stop and have conversation.         They're not going to

20     say good morning, how -- how are you, I certainly think

21     that's an attractive outfit you have on.          They're not going

22     to be friendly and gregarious like most East Texans usually

23     are.

24                 And that's because I've instructed them not to.

25     That's because the sole source of the information that you
Case 2:16-cv-00980-JRG Document 540 Filed 05/22/18 Page 108 of 114 PageID #: 45310

                                                                                 108




1      should have to help you make your decisions as jurors must

2      come from the witness stand, must come in open court, and

3      must come subject to cross-examination.

4                   So when that happens, don't hold whoever it is to

5      be at fault, don't hold it against them, don't think they're

6      being rude or unfriendly, don't have any negative feelings

7      about it.     It's just something that the Court requires of

8      them, and you should be aware of it so you'll be able to

9      take it in the right context.

10                  All right.   Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to

11     excuse you for lunch.      Your lunch is provided to you in the

12     jury room.    Follow all my instructions, including not to

13     discuss the case with anyone in any way.          It is about 20

14     minutes until 12:00.      And we'll do our very best to start at

15     12:30.

16                  Also, let me ask you to do this, too:        Those of

17     you that have brought cell phones with you, please don't

18     bring them back tomorrow.       Please leave them in the jury

19     room.    The lawyers in the case have electronic devices that

20     they're entitled to use.       It's part of their tools of their

21     profession.     But they're under strict orders not to have

22     them where they can ring unintentionally or disrupt the

23     trial process.     I'm going to ask you not to bring your cell

24     phones back to court tomorrow.

25                  If you're involved in a business transaction where

1      you need to check email or text messages, please leave it in

2      your car.    There will be opportunities where you can go to

3      your vehicle if absolutely necessary.         But unless it's

4      absolutely necessary, just leave it at home and don't bring

5      it with you, either iPhones, iPads, or any similar

6      electronic device.      That's starting tomorrow.

7                  With those instructions, ladies and gentlemen,

8      you're excused for lunch.       We'll reconvene at close as

9      possible to 12:30.

10                 The jury's excused.

11                 COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

12                 (Recess.)

13                 THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

14                 Mr. Kellman, I noticed that Plaintiff's corporate

15     representative was not present at counsel table during voir

16     dire.    I assume your corporate representative will be

17     beginning with opening statements.         She's there now.     I

18     didn't see her there earlier I think she was in the back of

19     the room.

20                 MR. KELLMAN:     Yes, Your Honor.

21                 THE COURT:     Okay.   Just want to make sure the

22     corporate representatives are positioned where the jury can

23     see each of them in their proper places at counsel table

24     throughout the proceedings.

25                 All right.     We'll start with my preliminary jury

1      instructions at 12:30, and move on, then, to opening

2      statements.

3                  Are there questions from either Plaintiff or

4      Defendants at this juncture that should be raised with the

5      Court?

6                  MR. KELLMAN:     The only question I have, Your

7      Honor, is if I could have a minute before we -- we start

8      with the jury?

9                  THE COURT:     Just show me where you want to put

10     these easels --

11                 MR. KELLMAN:     Sure.

12                 THE COURT:     -- or easel?

13                 MR. KELLMAN:     Thank you.

14                 I was hoping to put it right about here so that

15     I'm sort of centered on the jury.

16                 THE COURT:     And where do you intend to stand?

17                 MR. KELLMAN:     Stand next to it and talk.      And --

18     you know, obviously point to it, but I'm not planning to

19     move beyond here.

20                 THE COURT:     Okay.

21                 MR. KELLMAN:     I have one other item that -- Your

22     Honor, I have a box that is a shipping box, essentially.

23     And I'd like to be able to use that, as well.          Can I --

24     where -- am I -- can I put it -- I can put it back here or I

25     can put it on this table, whatever is okay with Your Honor.

1      I just don't want to --

2                  THE COURT:     And are you going to use that while

3      you're stand in front of the podium with the easel or will

4      that be separately?

5                  MR. KELLMAN:     For -- mostly separately, but it

6      might be -- it might be a little bit of back and forth, so

7      that's the only -- that's the only thing.          It's mostly just

8      the beginning, just to show a box.         That's all I'm really

9      doing.    I really -- I don't want to do anything that I'm not

10     supposed to.     That's all.

11                 THE COURT:     That's fine.    Now, is the box

12     something on the order of a banker's box?

13                 MR. KELLMAN:     About this -- smaller than that.

14                 THE COURT:     Smaller than a banker's box.

15                 MR. KELLMAN:     Yeah, I think -- I think it's a

16     cube.    I think it's about that size.

17                 THE COURT:     Then I'd simply say put it on the

18     table in front of the courtroom deputy.

19                 MR. KELLMAN:     Thank you.

20                 THE COURT:     Reach it from there.

21                 The only thing, Mr. Kellman, that -- that

22     positioning is perfectly okay with the Court.          When you're

23     away from the podium, you're going to need to speak up.

24                 MR. KELLMAN:     Yes.

25                 THE COURT:     So that not only the jury but

1      everybody is able to hear you.

2                   MR. KELLMAN:     Understood, Your Honor.

3                   One other question regarding the boards, just

4      where I can store them to start and where I can discard

5      them.    Can I do that up against the edge here or up

6      against --

7                   THE COURT:     Most of the time they're placed up

8      against the back wall in front of those wooden chairs.

9                   MR. KELLMAN:     Okay.    You want me to walk around

10     each time?     That -- that's fine if that's what Your Honor --

11                  THE COURT:     You're going to be moving multiple

12     boards to this easel?

13                  MR. KELLMAN:     There are about -- there are about

14     15 of them.

15                  THE COURT:     15?

16                  MR. KELLMAN:     I don't use any electronics.

17                  THE COURT:     Okay.

18                  MR. KELLMAN:     Right.

19                  THE COURT:     Well, then I would -- how -- how tall

20     are the boards?

21                  MR. KELLMAN:     They're 4 by 3.

22                  THE COURT:     Then I would stack them with the blank

23     side toward the jury right in front of the podium.

24                  MR. KELLMAN:     Oh, that would be wonderful.      Thank

25     you, Your Honor.

1                  THE COURT:     Just back there.

2                  MR. KELLMAN:     May I discard them over here?

3                  THE COURT:     That's fine, too.

4                  MR. KELLMAN:     Thank you very much.

5                  THE COURT:     And then when you are through with

6      your opening, make sure it all goes away.

7                  MR. KELLMAN:     Absolutely.     Thank you so much, Your

8      Honor.

9                  THE COURT:     And Defense counsel, without asking or

10     without formal leave of the Court, if you'll agree to

11     position yourself where you can see those demonstratives

12     when they're used.       Usually here on the far size of the jury

13     box is about the best place.

14                 All right.     Other questions we need to take up or

15     other logistics we need to discuss?

16                 MR. KELLMAN:     No, Your Honor.     Thank you for your

17     help.    I appreciate it.

18                 THE COURT:      Anything from Defendants, Mr. Ivey?

19                 MR. IVEY:    Nothing from the Defense, Your Honor.

20                 THE COURT:     Then we'll stand in recess for lunch

21     until 12:30.

22                 COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.
