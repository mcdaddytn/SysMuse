04:44:12   12   Q.   In fact, it says:       We have affordable DSPs that allow

04:44:18   13   us to implement all but --

04:44:20   14   A.   The most complex schemes.

04:44:22   15               THE COURT:     Gentlemen, you're going to talk one at

04:44:24   16   a time in this courtroom.        I've made that clear.     There's

04:44:26   17   no reason you can't do that.

04:44:28   18               THE WITNESS:     I apologize, Your Honor.

04:44:29   19               THE COURT:     One at a time.

04:44:30   20               Continue, counsel.

04:44:33   21   Q.   (By Mr. Re)    I just want it clear in the record what

04:44:35   22   Brandstein says.

04:44:37   23               Today we have affordable DSPs that allow us to

04:44:40   24   implement all but the most complex schemes cheaply in a

04:44:48   25   digital signal processing technology in real-time.

04:44:51    1               Do you see that?

04:44:51    2   A.   I do.

04:44:52    3   Q.   And does that suggest to one of ordinary skill in the

04:44:54    4   art to put various units of all kinds in a DSP?

04:44:58    5   A.   That's what the text teaches.

04:45:01    6               MR. RE:   I'll pass the witness, Your Honor.       Thank

04:45:03    7   you.

04:45:03    8               THE COURT:    Additional cross-examination?

04:45:06    9               MR. RUBINO:    Yes, Your Honor.

04:45:06   10                             RECROSS-EXAMINATION

04:45:18   11   BY MR. RUBINO:

04:45:18   12   Q.   Dr. Stern?

04:45:24   13   A.   Yes.

04:45:24   14   Q.   You didn't reference an Xbox in your analysis today,

04:45:29   15   did you?

04:45:29   16   A.   That was just a comment.

04:45:31   17   Q.   And that's not one of the references you combined?

04:45:34   18   A.   No.

04:45:34   19   Q.   You just made that up just now, right?

04:45:37   20   A.   I didn't make it up, but it's not part of the

04:45:39   21   testimony.     But it's -- it's not legally part of the

04:45:42   22   testimony.     It's not part of the report.

04:45:45   23   Q.   So the references that you did combine --

04:45:48   24   A.   Yes.

04:45:48   25   Q.   -- were only Brandstein, Li, Abutalebi --

04:45:53    1   A.   Dmochowski.

04:45:54    2   Q.   And Dmochowski, right?

04:45:55    3   A.   Correct, correct.

04:45:57    4   Q.   Those are the references -- that's the world of items

04:45:58    5   you're looking at for your motivation, right?

04:46:02    6   A.   That's correct.

04:46:02    7              MR. RUBINO:     Pass the witness, Your Honor.

04:46:03    8              THE COURT:     Further direct?

04:46:04    9              MR. RE:   Nothing further, Your Honor.       Thank you.

04:46:06   10              THE COURT:     All right.     Dr. Stern, you may step

04:46:08   11   down.

04:46:08   12              THE WITNESS:     Thank you, Your Honor.

04:46:09   13              THE COURT:     Mr. Re, does the Defendant desire this

04:46:18   14   witness to be excused?

04:46:19   15              MR. RE:   Yes, we do, Your Honor.

04:46:21   16              THE COURT:     Is there objection?

04:46:22   17              MR. RUBINO:     No, Your Honor.

04:46:23   18              THE COURT:     Dr. Stern, you are excused.

04:46:25   19              THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

04:46:26   20              THE COURT:     That means, sir, you're free to leave

04:46:28   21   us; you're free to stay.       It's your call.

04:46:30   22              THE WITNESS:     I'll stay for now.

04:46:32   23              THE COURT:     All right.     Defendant, call your next

04:46:33   24   witness.

04:46:34   25              MR. DACUS:     Thank you, Your Honor.     We call Dan
