# Attorney Spreadsheet Guide

This guide explains how to interpret the patent analysis spreadsheets generated by the portfolio analysis system.

---

## Directory Convention

**IMPORTANT**: Data files and macro files are stored in separate directories:

| Directory | Contents | Tracked in Git |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| `output/` | Data files (CSV, JSON) | No (gitignored) |
| `excel/` | VBA macro files (.bas) only | Yes |

**Rationale**: Data files are generated outputs and should not be committed to source control. Macro files are code and should be versioned.

To regenerate data files:
```bash
npm run export:attorney     # Full portfolio
npm run top250:v3          # Top 250 (V3)
npm run top250:recalc      # Top 250 (V2)
npm run export:withinsector # Within-sector
```

## Top 250 Spreadsheet (TOP250-*.csv)

The Top 250 represents the highest-priority patents based on a consensus score across multiple stakeholder perspectives.

### Stakeholder Profiles

Six different weighting profiles are used, representing different strategic approaches:

| Profile | Focus | Emphasizes |
|---------|-------|------------|
| IP Litigator (Aggressive) | Win big cases | Enforcement, high citations |
| IP Litigator (Balanced) | Standard litigation | All factors equally |
| IP Litigator (Conservative) | Low risk | Validity, strong prosecution |
| Licensing Specialist | Portfolio value | Market relevance, breadth |
| Corporate/M&A | Strategic deals | Business alignment |
| Executive/Portfolio | Balanced view | All factors |

The **Consensus Score** is the average across all profiles.

### Reading the Top 250

- **Higher rank = More valuable** under consensus view
- Patents at top are strong across multiple perspectives
- Review `competitors_citing` to identify licensing/litigation targets
- Check `sector` to understand technology groupings

---

## V2 Top 250 Spreadsheet (unified-top250-v2-*.csv)

The V2 model uses a simpler, citation-weighted scoring approach that emphasizes competitor interest over legal quality metrics.

### V2 Scoring Formula

```
Score = (competitor_citations / max_citations) × year_multiplier × 100
```

Where `year_multiplier` rewards patents with more remaining term.

### Key Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| rank | Position in V2 rankings |
| patent_id | USPTO patent number |
| **affiliate** | **Normalized portfolio entity** |
| title | Patent title |
| score_unified | V2 combined score (0-100) |
| competitor_citations | Citations from competitors |
| years_remaining | Years until expiration |
| year_multiplier | Term bonus factor |
| competitors | List of citing competitors |
| sector | Technology sector |
| score_aggressive | Score under aggressive profile |
| score_moderate | Score under moderate profile |
| score_conservative | Score under conservative profile |

### When to Use V2 vs V3

| Use V2 When | Use V3 When |
|-------------|-------------|
| Finding patents competitors are actively using | Evaluating litigation risk/reward |
| Identifying licensing opportunities | Prioritizing patents with strong legal posture |
| Volume-based analysis | Quality-focused analysis |

---

## Within-Sector Spreadsheet (WITHIN-SECTOR-*.csv)

This spreadsheet shows the top patents within each technology sector, allowing for technology-specific analysis.

### Available Sectors

|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `cloud-auth` | Cloud authentication, identity management | 40+ |
| `network-threat-protection` | Network security, threat detection | 200+ |
| `network-auth-access` | Network access control, ZTNA | 200+ |
| `computing-os-security` | Endpoint security, OS protection | 100+ |
| `video-codec` | Video encoding/decoding | 20+ |
| `rf-acoustic` | RF filters, BAW/FBAR | 300+ |
| `wireless` | Wireless communications | 100+ |
| `network-switching` | Network switches, routing | 50+ |

### Key Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| sector | Technology sector |
| sector_rank | Position within the sector (1 = best) |
| patent_id | USPTO patent number |
| **affiliate** | **Normalized portfolio entity** |
| title | Patent title |
| within_sector_score | Score relative to sector (0-100) |
| competitor_citations | Citations from competitors |
| competitor_count | Number of different competitors citing |
| years_remaining | Years until expiration |
| top_competitors | Top citing companies |
| citation_score | Component: citation strength |
| term_score | Component: remaining term value |
| diversity_score | Component: competitor diversity |

### Use Cases

1. **Sector-specific licensing**: Find the best patents in a specific technology area
2. **Target company analysis**: Which sectors have most citations from a specific competitor
3. **Portfolio gaps**: Identify sectors with few high-scoring patents
4. **Technology bundling**: Group patents by sector for assertion

## Using the Spreadsheets

### Finding Licensing Candidates

1. Open `ATTORNEY-PORTFOLIO-*.csv`
2. Filter `competitor_citations` > 5
3. Filter `years_remaining` > 5
4. Sort by `competitor_citations` descending
5. Review `competitors_citing` for target selection

### Identifying Strong Patents for Litigation

1. Open `TOP250-*.csv`
2. Filter by desired competitor in `competitors_citing`
3. Look for:
   - `eligibility_score` >= 4
   - `validity_score` >= 4
   - `enforcement_clarity` >= 4
4. Review `summary` and `technical_solution` for claim mapping

### Technology-Specific Analysis

1. Open `WITHIN-SECTOR-*.csv`
2. Filter by sector of interest (e.g., `video-codec`)
3. Review top patents within that technology area
4. Check `product_types` for market applications

### Finding Related Patents (Co-Citation Clusters)

1. Open `COCITATION-CLUSTERS-*.csv`
2. Clusters show patents frequently cited together by the same citing patents
3. Use for:
   - Litigation bundling (assert multiple patents together)
   - Understanding technology relationships
   - Identifying comprehensive coverage for a target

## Data Completeness Notes

- **Full analysis data** is available for the Top 250 and patents with high competitor citations
- **Basic USPTO data** is available for all ~10,000 patents
- **LLM analysis** has been run on ~380 patents (top priority subset)
- **IPR/Prosecution data** available for ~250 patents

Empty cells in the LLM score columns indicate the patent has not yet been prioritized for deep analysis. These patents may still have value but require further evaluation.

---

## Portfolio Entities (Excluded from Competitor Analysis)

The following entities are part of the Broadcom portfolio and are **not** counted as competitors:

- Broadcom Corporation
- Symantec Corporation (Enterprise division acquired 2019)

| 5 | Rock solid 101 | No prior art concerns | Very broad scope | Easy to detect |
| 4 | Strong technical | Minor concerns | Broad scope | Readily observable |
| 3 | Moderate | Some prior art | Moderate scope | Requires analysis |
| 2 | Some 101 risk | Significant overlap | Narrow | Difficult to prove |
| 1 | Likely ineligible | Strong prior art | Very narrow | Very hard to detect |

### Recommended Minimum Thresholds for Litigation

| Metric | Minimum | Ideal |
|--------|---------|-------|
| eligibility_score | 3 | 4+ |
| validity_score | 3 | 4+ |
| enforcement_clarity | 3 | 4+ |
| years_remaining | 5 | 7+ |
| competitor_citations | 3 | 10+ |
