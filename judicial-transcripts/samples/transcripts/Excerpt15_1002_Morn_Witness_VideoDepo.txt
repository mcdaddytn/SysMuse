10:47:27    1   Q.   Where the feature is software-related, how does Amazon

10:47:36    2   determine whether it's present in other similar products?

10:47:39    3   A.   Usually, you can tell by the specifications of what it

10:47:43    4   does, and it could be it has, you know, this noise

10:47:49    5   canceling.    It could have that ability to turn something on

10:47:55    6   or off, or the ability to phone home, or lots of different

10:47:59    7   things.   But, usually, it's in the specification.

10:48:01    8             If it's not, then sometimes we're able to send

10:48:04    9   those to people that can do evaluations to try and run

10:48:08   10   numerous tests to determine if something has something

10:48:10   11   inside or not.
