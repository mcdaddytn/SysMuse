  "contextDescription": "Video server and CDN patents cover the infrastructure for delivering streaming content at scale. Key areas include origin servers, edge caching, transcoding/packaging, manifest generation (HLS, DASH), multi-CDN orchestration, and quality-based routing. Major targets include cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), CDN operators (Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly), and streaming platforms (Netflix, Disney+, YouTube).",
  "scoringGuidance": [
    "Edge computing and distributed transcoding patents are high value as streaming shifts to the edge.",
    "Multi-CDN orchestration and failover patents target large streaming operations with redundancy requirements.",
    "Real-time packaging (just-in-time transcoding) patents are valuable for live streaming use cases.",
    "Patents covering manifest manipulation for ABR optimization have broad applicability.",
    "Look for patents that reduce origin load or improve cache hit ratios - these have direct cost implications."
