  "contextDescription": "Security patents protect systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, threats, and attacks. This super-sector spans network-layer security (firewalls, intrusion detection), authentication/access control, cryptography, secure boot/computing, and data protection technologies.",
  "scoringGuidance": [
    "For security patents, consider both the technical strength of the protection mechanism AND the practical deployability.",
    "Patents addressing sophisticated attack vectors (APT, zero-day, supply chain) score higher on threat sophistication.",
    "Component-level security patents (crypto primitives, secure elements) may score lower on security_layer but should score appropriately on their specialized sector questions.",
    "Enterprise security patents targeting compliance (SOC2, NIST, ISO 27001) should score higher on deployment_context when enterprise is applicable."
