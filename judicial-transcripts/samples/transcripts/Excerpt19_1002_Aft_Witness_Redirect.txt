03:44:55   18   Q.   And did you reveal this to the Patent Office?          In the

03:44:57   19   very first paper you sent them, you said:         Hey, we used

03:45:03   20   this reference.     You might want to take a look at it.

03:45:06   21   A.   Okay.

03:45:06   22   Q.   And did they do that?

03:45:06   23   A.   I did.

03:45:06   24   Q.   And did they issue -- and did they issue the patent?

03:45:08   25   A.   Yes.

03:45:09    1   Q.   Even though they knew about the Brandstein reference?

03:45:14    2   A.   Yes, I only remember I give all the relevant

03:45:16    3   information to patent agent.        Yeah, I --

03:45:19    4   Q.   And apparently he notified the Patent Office about it?

03:45:22    5   A.   Yeah.

03:45:23    6               MR. BAXTER:    Okay.   Thank you.    Your Honor, that's

03:45:27    7   all I have.

03:45:28    8               THE COURT:    All right.   You pass the witness,

03:45:30    9   Mr. Baxter?

03:45:31   10               MR. BAXTER:    Yes.

03:45:31   11               THE COURT:    Is there additional cross, Mr. Hadden?

03:45:33   12               MR. HADDEN:    Just very briefly, Your Honor.

03:45:38   13               THE COURT:    Proceed with your additional

03:45:40   14   cross-examination.

03:45:41   15               MR. HADDEN:    Thank you, Your Honor.

03:45:41   16                             RECROSS-EXAMINATION

03:45:41   17   BY MR. HADDEN:

03:45:41   18   Q.   Dr. Zhu, your counsel just showed you that provisional

03:45:47   19   application.     Do you recall that?


03:46:45   19   Q.   So you were telling the Patent Office that the error

03:46:49   20   you were identifying here had not been corrected in the

03:46:52   21   '049 patent; isn't that correct?

03:46:52   22   A.   I just said this error means this limitation was not

03:46:59   23   corrected in the first reissue.       So by error, I mean this

03:47:05   24   limitation was not corrected.       That was the error.

03:47:11   25               MR. HADDEN:   Move to strike, non-responsive,

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 331 Filed 10/09/20 Page 105 of 174 PageID #: 18843
                                                                                    507



03:47:14    1   Your Honor.

03:47:14    2               THE COURT:    Overruled.

03:47:18    3   Q.   (By Mr. Hadden)       Now, if you look at --

03:47:27    4               MR. HADDEN:    Can we go to Page 2 of 2 of this

03:47:30    5   document, Mr. Berk, with Dr. Zhu's signature?

03:47:32    6   Q.   (By Mr. Hadden)       Is that your signature, Dr. Zhu?

03:47:38    7   A.   Yes.

03:47:41    8   Q.   And you signed this in July 22nd of this year; is that

03:47:45    9   correct?

03:47:45   10   A.   Yes.

03:47:47   11   Q.   Okay.    And when you signed that, did you understand

03:47:51   12   that when you said that the patent was inoperable or

03:47:57   13   invalid, you're signing that under oath?

03:47:59   14   A.   I saw that's the routine paper.        I don't want to argue

03:48:03   15   that.   Yeah.

03:48:05   16   Q.   Did you understand that you're signing this under oath

03:48:09   17   when you signed it in July of 2020?

03:48:12   18   A.   Yeah, I understand that.       Yeah.

03:48:14   19   Q.   Thank you.

03:48:15   20               MR. HADDEN:    No further questions.

03:48:16   21               THE COURT:    Any additional direct?

03:48:18   22               MR. BAXTER:    Yes, Your Honor.

03:48:18   23                             REDIRECT EXAMINATION

03:48:19   24   BY MR. BAXTER:

03:48:19   25   Q.   So, Dr. Zhu, the paper you signed, did it have anything

03:48:33    1   to do with the patent in this case?

03:48:36    2   A.   No.

03:48:36    3   Q.   No?

03:48:39    4              MR. BAXTER:     That's all I have, Your Honor.

03:48:40    5              THE COURT:     Additional cross?

03:48:41    6              MR. HADDEN:     No, Your Honor.

03:48:42    7              THE COURT:     All right.   Dr. Zhu, you may step

03:48:45    8   down.

03:48:45    9              MR. BAXTER:     Can she be excused, Your Honor,

03:48:48   11              THE COURT:     Any objection?

03:48:49   12              MR. HADDEN:     No, Your Honor.

03:48:49   13              THE COURT:     All right.   The witness is excused.

03:48:52   14              You're free to stay; you're free to leave.

03:48:55   15              MR. BAXTER:     Thank you, Your Honor.

03:48:56   16              THE WITNESS:     Thank you, Judge.

03:49:10   17              THE COURT:     Plaintiff, call your next witness.

03:49:12   18              MR. FABRICANT:     Yes, Your Honor.

                                                                                    509



03:49:38    1              MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:     Thank you.

03:49:38    2                CHIAWEI "JERRY" WU, PLAINTIFF'S WITNESS

03:49:40    3                      PRESENTED BY VIDEO DEPOSITION

03:49:40    4              (Videoclip played.)

03:49:44    5   Q.   Okay.   Mr. Wu, can you please state your name for the

03:49:52    6   record?

03:49:52    7   A.   Sure.   My name is Jerry Wu.     My official name is

03:49:55    8   Chiawei, C-h-i-a-w-e-i, but I go by Jerry at work.


03:50:36   23   Q.   But the technology sourcing you worked on, ultimately

03:50:40   24   evolved into the Echo project and the Echo product at

03:50:43   25   Amazon, correct?

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 331 Filed 10/09/20 Page 108 of 174 PageID #: 18846
                                                                                    510



03:50:44    1   A.   Some of them, yes.     But you have to be more specific

03:50:51    2   exactly what that is.      I don't understand that question

03:50:54    3   very well.

03:50:54    4   Q.   How many vendors did you meet with, when you were

03:51:00    5   working at Amazon?

03:51:01    6               ATTORNEY:   Objection.

03:51:02    7   A.   Probably at least several hundred.

03:51:05    8   Q.   So to ask you a slightly broader question.         How many

03:51:12    9   technology vendors did you initiate a dialog with, start

03:51:16   10   talking to?

03:51:16   11   A.   I don't recall, but it's going to be up in the

03:51:21   12   hundreds.

03:51:21   13   Q.   So, you know, to put that another way, it's fair to say

03:51:24   14   that, you know, one in four or one in five of the companies

03:51:31   15   that you saw at a trade show or received a solicitation

03:51:35   16   from proceeded to the NDA phase, right?

03:51:38   17   A.   Correct.

03:51:39   18               ATTORNEY:   Objection.

03:51:40   19   Q.   And at least -- there was at least some indication from

03:51:43   20   Amazon's perspective that when you went to the NDA phase,

03:51:47   21   there was some initial interest in that company, right?

03:51:49   22   A.   Yes.

03:51:50   23   Q.   Now, during that process, do you recall any of those

03:51:56   24   potential vendors telling you that they had patents

03:52:00   25   protecting their products that they were looking to sell to

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 331 Filed 10/09/20 Page 109 of 174 PageID #: 18847
                                                                                    511



03:52:04    1   Amazon?

03:52:05    2   A.   No.   Because in a sales presentation will only tell you

03:52:16    3   how that thing fits in that topic for you, how we can use

03:52:20    4   that up -- that use cases.      But no mention of patents.

03:52:23    5   Q.   No mention of any type of intellectual property, right?

03:52:27    6   A.   No.

03:52:33    7   Q.   If that would have been a presentation, you would have

03:52:36    8   remembered it, right?

03:52:37    9   A.   Correct.   Because it's such an abnormal behavior,

03:52:40   10   because I have never -- I've been doing this almost, what,

03:52:43   11   since 90 -- since 2000.     So a 20-year career.       I don't see

03:52:48   12   any patents usually mentioned in sales or technical

03:52:51   13   reviews.
