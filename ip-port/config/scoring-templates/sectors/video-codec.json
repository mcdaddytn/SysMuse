  "contextDescription": "Video codec patents cover the core compression technologies used in streaming, broadcast, and recording. Key areas include motion estimation/compensation, transform coding (DCT, DST), entropy coding (CABAC, CAVLC), loop filtering, intra/inter prediction, and rate control. Standards include H.264/AVC, HEVC/H.265, VVC/H.266, VP9, and AV1. Patent value often correlates with standards essentiality and adoption breadth.",
