09:28:42    7   Q.   Did you see where he said mistakes had been made?

09:28:45    8   A.   No, I did not see.      As I mentioned, I only saw -- I was

09:28:48    9   working.

09:28:50   10              MR. BAXTER:    That's all I have, Your Honor.         Thank

09:28:52   11   you very much.

09:28:52   12              THE COURT:    You pass the witness?      Mr. Baxter, you

09:28:57   13   pass the witness?

09:28:58   14              MR. BAXTER:    Oh, I do, Your Honor.      Yes, sir.

09:28:59   15              THE COURT:    Is there additional direct,

09:29:02   16   Mr. Hadden?

09:29:02   17              MR. HADDEN:    Just briefly, Your Honor.

09:29:03   18              THE COURT:    All right.   Proceed with your

09:29:05   19   redirect.

09:29:06   20              MR. HADDEN:    Thank you, Your Honor.

09:29:07   21              Can we get Plaintiff's 131 up again, please,

09:29:11   22   Mr. Berk?     Can we go to the next page and the paragraph

09:29:20   23   that says "our company holds several patents," can you just

09:29:25   24   blow up that paragraph?

09:29:27    1   BY MR. HADDEN:

09:29:27    2   Q.   Now, Vocalife's counsel was asking you about this

09:29:31    3   paragraph, suggesting that Dr. Li said there was a problem.

09:29:38    4               MR. HADDEN:    Can we blow up the language -- the

09:29:41    5   last sentence?

09:29:50    6   Q.   (By Mr. Hadden)      Now, in this email, Dr. Li says:        We

09:29:53    7   believe our patents and technology will be very useful to

09:29:56    8   Amazon's business, to extend your patent portfolio, and to

09:29:59    9   protect your products.

09:30:03   10               Do you see that?

09:30:03   11   A.   Yes, I see that.
