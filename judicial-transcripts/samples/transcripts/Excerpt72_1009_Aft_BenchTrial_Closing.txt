03:51:43    8           THE COURT:     You have two minutes,

03:51:45    9   Mr. Lambrianakos.

03:51:45   10           MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:      And so, based on all those

03:51:47   11   facts, Your Honor, we don't believe that the Defendants

03:51:50   12   have even approached the level of proof required to show

03:51:53   13   material -- materiality and the specific intent to deceive

03:51:58   14   the Patent Office by clear and convincing evidence.

03:51:59   15           Thank you, Your Honor.

03:52:01   16           THE COURT:     Thank you.

03:52:02   17           Thank you, counsel, for your able argument and the

03:52:07   18   presentation of evidence to the bench regarding this

03:52:11   19   inequitable conduct defense as urged by Defendants.

03:52:15   20           These matters -- this matter is under submission.

03:52:20   21           MS. DOAN:     Your Honor?

03:52:21   22           THE COURT:     And I appreciate the presentation you

03:52:23   23   made today.

03:52:23   24           Do you have a question, Ms. Doan?

03:52:25   25           MS. DOAN:     I do, Your Honor.      How would you like

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 341 Filed 10/09/20 Page 125 of 136 PageID #: 19920
                                                                                   1518



03:52:27    1   us to submit the exhibits that came into evidence today?              I

03:52:31    2   don't know we've had a chance to meet --

03:52:33    3            THE COURT:    I'd like you to deliver them to the

03:52:37    4   courtroom deputy, who will see that I get them.

03:52:39    5            Mr. Fabricant?

03:52:41    6            MR. FABRICANT:     Would Your Honor like any

03:52:43    7   post-trial submissions on this trial?

03:52:45    8            THE COURT:    I'll leave that option open.         I won't

03:52:50    9   order it at this time.     Once I review my notes and the

03:52:55   10   evidence that you've submitted in tangible form, I may ask

03:52:56   11   for additional post-trial briefing.        I may not.     I'll carry

03:53:00   12   that option as a part of my consideration of what you

03:53:04   13   presented today.

03:53:04   14            MR. FABRICANT:     Thank you, Your Honor.

03:53:04   15            (Bench trial concluded.)
