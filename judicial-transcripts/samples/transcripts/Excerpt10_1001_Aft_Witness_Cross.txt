05:04:42   18   A.   Yes.

05:04:46   21   Q.   I understand that you met with Amazon, you said, in

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 124 of 156 PageID #: 18585
                                                                                    249

05:05:04    2   A.   Microphone array, including circular array.

05:05:07    3   Q.   Yes.     And also about -- you also went there to discuss

05:05:12    5   A.   Yes.

05:05:29   12   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      I believe those are listed in your

05:05:32   13   presentation.      Is this the presentation you discussed with

05:05:34   14   counsel?

05:05:34   15   A.   Yes.

05:05:35   16   Q.   And these are the slides that you presented or sent to

05:05:44   17   Amazon on or about October 17th, 2011?

05:05:47   18   A.   Yes.

05:05:48   19   Q.   And let's take a look, particularly at the page that

05:05:51   20   actually discusses the subject matter relevant to your '049

05:05:55   21   patent.

05:05:55   22               MR. RE:   If we can go to Page 5, please.

05:05:58   23   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And these where you list your core

05:06:04   24   technologies?

05:06:04   25   A.   Yes.

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 125 of 156 PageID #: 18586
                                                                                    250



05:06:05    1   Q.   And is it your testimony you presented these

05:06:08    2   technologies to Amazon in October of 2011?

05:06:13    3   A.   Right.

05:06:17    4   Q.   Let's go through those one at a time, and I have those

05:06:20    5   blown up because I want to take some notes.

05:06:23    6               You recognize this coming from the top of Page 5

05:06:30    7   on your screen?

05:06:34    8   A.   Could you repeat your question?

05:06:36    9   Q.   You see how this is just a picture of the top of Page 5

05:06:39   10   from the exhibit you sent to Amazon after your meeting on

05:06:42   11   October 2011.     Do you see that?

05:06:44   12   A.   Yes.

05:06:44   13   Q.   And I want to break this down a little bit to see if we

05:06:49   14   can see a little more about these ideas.

05:06:51   15               Now, the first item on the list is microphone

05:06:55   16   array, linear, circular; do you see that?

05:06:57   17   A.   Yes.

05:06:57   18   Q.   And you did not invent the linear or circular

05:07:02   19   microphone array, correct?

05:07:07   20   A.   Right.

05:07:07   21   Q.   And you know that those are very well-known by the time

05:07:15   22   you came to Amazon in 2011, right?

05:07:17   23   A.   Linear array was very well-known.       Circular array,

05:07:25   24   there was no product.

05:07:26   25   Q.   Let me show you what's been previously marked as

05:07:43    3   Exhibit 51, this article by Jacek Dmochowski?

05:07:48    4   A.    Uh-huh.

05:07:50    5   Q.    You are?    You've seen this before?

05:07:53    6                THE COURT:   You'll have to answer out loud,

05:07:56    7   Dr. Li.       Non-verbalized answers won't work.     So say yes or

05:08:01    8   no.     Don't say uh-huh.

05:08:03    9   A.    Yes.

05:08:04   10   Q.    (By Mr. Re)    And you see that this article was first

05:08:08   11   published in May of 2007.       Do you see that?

05:08:11   12   A.    Yes.

05:08:11   13   Q.    And I'd like to show you Page 2 of this exhibit, and at

05:08:20   14   the bottom, beginning with circular arrays, do you see

05:08:22   15   that?

05:08:23   16   A.    Yeah.
