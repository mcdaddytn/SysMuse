05:48:55    8   Q.   And I want to show you what you tried to claim in this

05:49:01    9   application.

05:49:01   10               MR. RE:   If we can go to Claim 4 of this

05:49:04   11   application.

05:49:11   12   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And do you see in this claim you wrote --

05:49:16   13               MR. RE:   If we can just highlight.

05:49:18   14   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      You wrote:   The surface constructed by the

05:49:22   15   points of microphone components of the microphone array can

05:49:25   16   be in any geometry shape, such as a sphere, a half sphere,

05:49:31   17   partial sphere, circle, et cetera, and that it is not

05:49:36   18   necessary to be in a flat plane.

05:49:39   19               Right?

05:49:39   20   A.   Yes.

05:49:40   21   Q.   And so here's an application where you are disclosing

05:49:43   22   at least a circular microphone array, right?

05:49:46   23   A.   Yes.

05:49:49   24               THE COURT:   Mr. Re, let me ask you, what do you

05:49:52   25   anticipate the remainder of your cross-examination to be?

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 153 of 156 PageID #: 18614
                                                                                    278



05:49:55    1   Just an estimate, time-wise.

05:49:59    2           MR. RE:    Well into tomorrow, and I have --

05:50:02    3           THE COURT:     That's what I'm trying to determine.

05:50:04    4   What is "well into tomorrow"?

05:50:06    5           MR. RE:    At least -- at least another hour-plus.

05:50:09    6           THE COURT:     Okay.   Then, with that, we'll use this

05:50:12    7   point -- there's not a perfect point.         But we'll use this

05:50:15    8   point to break for the day.


05:51:10    1   in the morning.     With those instructions, we're excused for

05:51:13    2   the evening.

05:51:14    3             COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

05:51:16    4             (Jury out.)

05:51:16    5             THE COURT:     Please be seated.

05:51:40    6             You may step down, Dr. Li.       You may step down,

05:51:46    7   Dr. Li.     You can return to the counsel table.

05:51:51    8             THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

05:51:52    9             THE COURT:     Counsel, let me remind you that before

05:51:54   10   I bring in the jury in the morning, as I indicated during

05:51:58   11   the pre-trial conferences, I will expect both sides to have


05:53:09    7           All right.     Are there questions from either party

05:53:13    8   before we recess for the evening?

05:53:15    9           MS. TRUELOVE:     Nothing from Plaintiff, Your Honor.

05:53:17   10           MR. DACUS:     Just one thing, Your Honor, and it

05:53:20   11   probably falls in the category of lawyers saying things

05:53:23   12   that they don't need to say, but --

05:53:24   13           THE COURT:     That's a big category, Mr. Dacus.

05:53:27   14           MR. DACUS:     They say them anyway to make

05:53:27   15   themselves and others around them feel good.          But it's been

05:53:28   16   my understanding that the Court's practice is for the

05:53:31   17   witness whose examination is continuing the next day, not

05:53:34   18   to consult with his lawyers related to the testimony.

05:53:38   19           THE COURT:     That's the Court's practice.

05:53:41   20           MR. DACUS:     I've said it.     I'll sit down.      Thank

05:53:44   21   you.

05:53:44   22           THE COURT:     All right.     One other thing, let me

05:53:47   23   say, I have no problem with counsel using boards or using

05:53:51   24   the easel.    But Mr. Fabricant has had the podium between

05:53:56   25   the easel and himself the entire time.         We need to make

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 156 of 156 PageID #: 18617
                                                                                    281



05:53:56    1   sure the easel is used so opposing counsel at least has an

05:54:01    2   opportunity to see it.

05:54:02    3              And it's clear, Dr. Re [sic], as was mentioned in

05:54:07    4   the early part of the direct, has a hearing problem.            So I

05:54:08    5   think it behooves all of us to raise our volume as best we

05:54:14    6   can.

05:54:14    7              Okay.   So if there's not anything further, we

05:54:16    8   stand in recess.

05:54:18    9              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:     All rise.

05:54:19   10              (Recess.)

           11

           12                             CERTIFICATION

           13

           14              I HEREBY CERTIFY that the foregoing is a true and
