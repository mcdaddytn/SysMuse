Project Synopsis

The Elastic Search Query Generator (ESIndex for short, used for root directory name) project intends to generate interesting queries from a corpus to help a user navigate the documents.  It will initially generate searches that will provide subqueries that can be combined in interesting ways to navigate the corpus.  It employs stopwords, bm25 and similar calculations, elasticsearch and relational database storage of document information and will drive a data visualization for search.  It will measure orthogonality of search terms with respect to the corpus to find interesing relationships among documents.  We will develop hierarchical categories to assign to search terms to assist in establishing document clusters.


Project Knowledge

The tech stack is Node.js/Prisma Orm/MySql/TypeScript and is all client driven, running from the command line.  In the future it will be integrated into a larger framework including Express.js. using langchain for llm, winston for logging, axios on client side, jwt for authentication, and vue or quasar for GUI.

In terms of the TypeScript language, explicly type variables when possible as it facilitates development and debugging in an IDE.  Whenever coding changes are complex and involve multiple changes in a code file, just generate the entire code file.  If just doing an incremental enhancement, describe clearly where it should be merged and provide proper identation, so it can be cut and pasted easily in place.

On database schema definition with prisma orm, all entities added should have the following fields unless otherwise noted:
  id        Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime   @default(now())

If providing curl commands to test something that requires posting json, separate the json into a separate file (do not embed in the command line).





Notes from Schema Redesign

Enhanced Search Term Extraction System
I've created a comprehensive implementation for your enhanced corpus and search term extraction system. The changes will enable more flexible search operations, sophisticated metrics, and a more robust data model overall.
Schema Updates
The updated Prisma schema now includes:

CorpusType - Defines corpus attributes with document types and default metadata
CorpusDocumentType - Document types within a corpus type with DocType enum support
DocumentTypeField - Field definitions with type and indexing information
Enhanced SearchTerm - Now linked to document fields that originated them
Corpus Set Operations - Support for various search and set operations
Document Sets - Store results of operations with detailed metrics

New Operations
The implementation supports these operations:

CORPUSSNAPSHOT - Create a baseline snapshot of all documents
SETUNION/SETINTERSECTION - Combine document sets mathematically
ESKEYWORDSEARCH - Simple keyword-based search
ESJSONSEARCH/ESJSONFILESEARCH - Advanced queries using Elasticsearch JSON syntax
ESSEARCHTERMTEST - Test each search term's effectiveness

Key Components

executeCorpusOperation.ts - Core logic for running all operation types
setupCorpusType.ts/setupDocumentTypes.ts - Schema management tools
updated-import-stopwords.ts - Now with corpus linkage
sample-config-files - Examples for all major operations

Implementation Notes

Two-Pass Architecture: The system maintains your existing two-pass approach for document import and term extraction.
Phrase Support: The full phrase extraction functionality is preserved and works with the new metadata-rich model.
Metrics Calculation: Both document-level and set-level metrics are calculated, providing rich information about search effectiveness.
Batch Processing: Large operations like ESSEARCHTERMTEST run in configurable batches to manage resource usage.
Error Handling: Robust error handling throughout to ensure operations complete even if individual items fail.

Next Steps

Update Existing Data: Run the setup tasks to create corpus types for your existing data
Run Initial Snapshots: Create baseline document sets for comparison
Test Search Terms: Execute term tests to evaluate effectiveness of extracted terms
Implement Agent Loop: This framework provides the foundation for an agentic loop that could iteratively improve search terms based on performance metrics

This enhanced system gives you a powerful platform for experimenting with different search term extraction approaches and measuring their effectiveness, all while maintaining compatibility with your current workflow.
