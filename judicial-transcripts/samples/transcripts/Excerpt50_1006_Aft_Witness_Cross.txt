04:10:25    5   Q.   And so they just didn't have the information whenever

04:10:27    6   they examined either the '049 or its predecessor

04:10:33    7   surrendered '756 patent?

04:10:35    8   A.   Right.    My guess is the normal thing to do is just to

04:10:39    9   look at other patents.

04:10:40   10            MR. RE:    I'll pass the witness.

04:10:42   11            Thank you very much, Dr. Stern.

04:10:44   12            THE WITNESS:     You're welcome.

04:10:45   13            THE COURT:     All right.    Before we proceed with

04:10:47   14   Plaintiff's cross-examination of this witness, we're going

04:10:49   15   to take a brief recess, ladies and gentlemen.

04:10:51   16            If you'll simply close your notebooks, leave them

04:10:55   17   in your chairs, follow all the instructions I've given you,

04:10:58   18   including not to discuss the case among yourselves.            We'll

04:11:01   19   be back here -- I'm going to try to keep this as a short

04:11:06   20   recess -- we'll be back here shortly to continue.

04:11:12   21            The jury is excused for recess.

04:11:15   22            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

04:11:17   23            THE WITNESS:     Your Honor, may I step down, as

04:11:19   24   well?

04:11:20   25            THE COURT:     When the jury leaves.      Just stay where

04:11:32    4   demonstrative during your cross-examination?

04:11:35    5              MR. RUBINO:     No, I'm not going to, Your Honor.

04:11:36    6              THE COURT:     All right.     During a recess, let's

04:11:38    7   take it down and put it back.

04:24:44   14              Mr. Rubino, if you'd like to go to the podium and

04:24:49   15   prepare for cross-examination.

04:24:50   16              Are there binders that the Plaintiff has to

04:24:52   17   distribute?    Let's do that now, please.

04:25:22   18              Mr. Mixon, if you'd bring in the jury, please.

04:25:26   19              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.
