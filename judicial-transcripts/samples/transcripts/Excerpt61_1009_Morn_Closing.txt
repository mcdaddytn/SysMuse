08:29:35    2           (Jury out.)

08:29:37    3           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

08:29:56    4           THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

08:30:52    5           Counsel, before I bring the jury in, tell me who

08:31:52    6   is going to present closing arguments for each side, how

08:31:57    7   you want your time accounted for, and what, if any,

08:32:01    8   warnings do you want on your time.

08:32:04    9           Let me hear from Plaintiff first.

08:32:05   10           MR. FABRICANT:      Good morning, Your Honor.

08:32:07   11           THE COURT:     Good morning.

08:32:07   12           MR. FABRICANT:      For our closing argument,

08:32:11   13   Your Honor, Jennifer Truelove will begin the closing

08:32:13   14   argument, and I will follow Jennifer Truelove.           We want to

08:32:18   15   split our time 20 minutes for the initial closing and 20

08:32:25   16   minutes for the rebuttal closing.

08:32:27   17           THE COURT:     And how do you and Ms. Truelove hope

08:32:30   18   to divide the first 20 minutes?

08:32:31   19           MR. FABRICANT:      I think the best estimate is

08:32:33   20   approximately 10 minutes or so for Ms. Truelove of the

08:32:35   21   first 20 minutes, Your Honor.

08:32:36   22           THE COURT:     Does Ms. Truelove want a warning at

08:32:40   23   any point, or are you going to take what's left of the

08:32:42   24   first 20 whenever she stops?

08:32:42   25           MS. TRUELOVE:     I think that's what will happen,

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 340 Filed 10/09/20 Page 4 of 108 PageID #: 19691
                                                                                   1289



08:32:46    1   Your Honor.   I don't need a warning from the Court.

08:32:46    2             THE COURT:    Okay.

08:32:47    3             MR. FABRICANT:    Your Honor, if I could have a

08:32:48    4   warning at three minutes of the first 20?

08:32:51    5             THE COURT:    When 17 have been used?

08:32:52    6             MR. FABRICANT:    Yes.

08:32:53    7             THE COURT:    I will do that.     And then on the

08:32:57    8   second closing you'll do the entirety of it?

08:33:01    9             MR. FABRICANT:    I will, Your Honor.      If I can have

08:33:03   10   a warning at five minutes and two minutes.

08:33:06   11             THE COURT:    All right.   Mr. Fabricant.

08:33:07   12             MR. FABRICANT:    Thank you, Your Honor.

08:33:08   13             THE COURT:    Thank you.

08:33:08   14             Mr. Hadden, what's the Defendants' plan in this

08:33:13   15   regard?

08:33:13   16             MR. HADDEN:    Yes, Your Honor.     I'll be splitting

08:33:16   17   with Mr. Dacus.   I'll do approximately the first 25 to 30

08:33:22   18   minutes, if I could get a warning with 15 minutes left.             15

08:33:27   19   minutes before the end, Your Honor.

08:33:29   20             THE COURT:    All right.   15 minutes left.       That

08:33:31   21   means, out of 40 minutes total, when 25 have been used?

08:33:36   22             MR. HADDEN:    Yes, Your Honor.     Thank you.

08:33:37   23             THE COURT:    And then whenever you stop, Mr. Dacus

08:33:39   24   will finish with whatever you leave him?

08:33:41   25             MR. HADDEN:    Correct, Your Honor.

                                                                                   1290



08:33:43    1              THE COURT:    Mr. Dacus, regardless of what amount

08:33:45    2   of time that might be, what kind of warning, if any, do you

08:33:50    3   want?

08:33:51    4              MR. DACUS:    If you would just tell me when I have

08:33:54    5   two minutes, please, Your Honor, I'd appreciate it.

08:33:58    6              THE COURT:    Two minutes remaining.

08:33:58    7              MR. DACUS:    Thank you, Your Honor.

08:33:59    8              MR. HADDEN:    Thank you, Your Honor.

08:34:00    9              THE COURT:    Thank you, counsel.

08:34:00   10              Ladies and gentlemen, before I bring in the jury,

08:34:06   11   we have quite a few people in the courtroom.          Many of you

08:34:10   12   are associated with one side or the other of the case and

08:34:12   13   have invested time and work and resources in the trial

08:34:16   14   process.


08:35:19    8              All right.   Is there anything from either

08:35:21    9   Plaintiff or Defendant before we bring in the jury?

08:35:23   10              MS. TRUELOVE:   One thing, Your Honor.       We intend

08:35:25   11   to use a couple of boards during closing arguments.            And


08:35:53   21              THE COURT:   And you intend to have boards or

08:35:58   22   demonstratives up on both easels at the same time?

08:36:01   23              MS. TRUELOVE:   That's correct, Your Honor, and

08:36:02   24   interchanging some as -- as Mr. Fabricant goes throughout

08:36:05   25   his closing argument.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 340 Filed 10/09/20 Page 7 of 108 PageID #: 19694
                                                                                   1292



08:36:07    1              THE COURT:   Okay.   And will members of the trial

08:36:15    2   team put up and take down the boards, or will the arguing

08:36:19    3   attorney be walking across the courtroom with a board in

08:36:22    4   hand trying to put it on the easel?

08:36:24    5              MS. TRUELOVE:    We've got Mr. Lambrianakos and

08:36:26    6   Mr. Rubino handling the boards, trying to do that as least

08:36:30    7   disruptive as possible.

08:36:31    8              THE COURT:   Will this occur in the Plaintiff's

08:36:34    9   first or second or in both closings?

08:36:37   10              MS. TRUELOVE:    I think both, Your Honor, yes.

08:36:38   11              THE COURT:   All right.   And how soon into

08:36:42   12   Plaintiff's first closing argument do you expect to be

08:36:43   13   using one or both easels?

08:36:45   14              MS. TRUELOVE:    I don't intend to use them during

08:36:47   15   my remarks at all.      So they'll be used when Mr. Fabricant

08:36:51   16   starts going through the evidence.

08:36:53   17              MR. FABRICANT:    Your Honor, we have a total of

08:36:54   18   five boards.    Two would be used in the first 20 minutes.

08:36:58   19   And then in the final 20 minutes, we have two that would

08:37:02   20   come up.    And then at the very, very end, one last board.

08:37:05   21              THE COURT:   All right.   And this has been

08:37:08   22   previewed with Mr. Dacus and Defendants?         You all -- you

08:37:12   23   have an idea, Mr. Dacus, of what they're proposing to do?

08:37:16   24              MR. DACUS:   I have an idea of where they're

08:37:19   25   proposing to put the easels.      I have not seen the boards,

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 340 Filed 10/09/20 Page 8 of 108 PageID #: 19695
                                                                                   1293



08:37:22    1   but I have an idea of where they intend to put the easels.

08:37:22    2   And we have no objection to where they intend to place

08:37:28    3   them, Your Honor.     I would ask that they take the boards

08:37:31    4   down once they conclude.

08:37:32    5            THE COURT:    That is my typical practice for both

08:37:36    6   sides.

08:37:36    7            Often I will wait to see if opposing counsel is

08:37:39    8   going to use the other side's demonstrative as part of

08:37:42    9   their cross-examination, but we won't have that in closing.

08:37:45   10            So whenever you conclude with your first or your

08:37:51   11   final closing arguments, Plaintiff, you need to make sure

08:37:54   12   that the boards are taken down.

08:37:56   13            MR. FABRICANT:     Yes, Your Honor.

08:37:57   14            THE COURT:    And I would suggest you go ahead and

08:37:59   15   set up the second easel, put it where you want it so that

08:38:02   16   we don't have that disruption going on while the jury is in

08:38:07   17   the courtroom.


08:39:33    6   then we had to reconnect it and delay the process.

08:39:37    7           And so until you and I talk about it, keep your IT

08:39:43    8   stuff where it is, okay?

08:39:47    9           MR. RUBINO:     Your Honor, if we may take the boards

08:39:49   10   out of the crinkly paper?

08:39:51   11           THE COURT:     Yes.

08:39:51   12           MR. DACUS:     Your Honor, may I ask a question?

08:39:53   13           THE COURT:     Yes, sir.

08:39:54   14           MR. DACUS:     I'm just concerned the way this is

08:39:56   15   faced that I won't be able to see it.         And Mr. Hadden, once

08:40:00   16   they place the board, can we position ourselves so that we

08:40:03   17   can see it?

08:40:03   18           THE COURT:     I think you're entitled to see what

08:40:06   19   they're going to use, Defendants.        I just hope we can do it

08:40:09   20   in a way that we don't have a circus going on in here with

08:40:16   21   people walking all around the room.

08:40:19   22           MR. DACUS:     Understood, Your Honor.

08:40:20   23           THE COURT:     Probably the best approach, Mr. Dacus,

08:40:24   24   is this vacant chair between Mr. Hilmes and Mr. Re, if you

08:40:29   25   could pull that back a little bit.        Whoever is going to be

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 340 Filed 10/09/20 Page 10 of 108 PageID #: 19697
                                                                                    1295



08:40:34    1   doing closing, from that posture, you ought to be able to

08:40:38    2   see both boards.

08:40:39    3              MR. DACUS:    Thank you, Your Honor.

08:40:40    4              THE COURT:    But, certainly, I want to accommodate

08:40:44    5   each side to see what the other one uses.

08:40:46    6              MR. DACUS:    Thank you very much.

08:40:51    7              THE COURT:    Yes, I'm very glad we got that done in

08:40:58    8   advance.

08:41:10    9              Just so I'll be sure and know, Mr. Dacus, will

08:41:13   10   Defendant be using any boards or easels or anything like

08:41:16   11   that during closing?

08:41:18   12              MR. HADDEN:     No, Your Honor.

08:41:19   13              MR. DACUS:    No, Your Honor.

08:41:20   14              THE COURT:    Okay.   All right.    Is there anything

08:41:51   15   else from either Plaintiff or Defendant before I bring in

08:41:54   16   the jury?

08:41:54   17              MS. TRUELOVE:     Nothing from Plaintiff, Your Honor.

08:41:55   18              MR. DACUS:    Nothing from Amazon, Your Honor.

08:41:57   19              THE COURT:    All right.   Mr. Mixon, if you'd bring

08:42:02   20   in the jury, please.

08:42:04   21              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

08:42:05   22              (Jury in.)

08:42:05   23              THE COURT:    Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

08:42:36   24   Please be seated.

08:42:36   25              Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have now

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 340 Filed 10/09/20 Page 11 of 108 PageID #: 19698
                                                                                    1296



08:42:47    1   heard the evidence in this case, and I'll now instruct you

08:42:52    2   on the law that you must apply.
