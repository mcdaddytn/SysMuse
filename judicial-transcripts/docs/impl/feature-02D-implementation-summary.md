# Feature 02D Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Phase2Processor State Management
- Added `previousLine`, `allLines`, and `currentLineIndex` to `ProcessingState` interface
- Modified `processSession` to flatten all lines and provide access to previous lines
- This allows the processor to look back at previous lines when needed

### 2. Rewritten checkExaminationChange Method
The method now:
- Uses exact pattern matching for examination types (DIRECT EXAMINATION, CROSS-EXAMINATION, etc.)
- Detects both standalone examination lines and those with CONTINUED
- For DIRECT EXAMINATION, CONTINUED examinations, and VIDEO DEPOSITION:
  - Looks at the previous line for witness information
  - Parses witness name, caller (PLAINTIFF/DEFENDANT), and sworn status
  - Creates or updates witness records as needed
- For other examination types (CROSS, REDIRECT, RECROSS without CONTINUED):
  - Uses the current witness from state (witness stays on stand)
  - Updates sworn status to PREVIOUSLY_SWORN if needed
- Creates a WitnessCalledEvent for each examination change
- Saves events immediately rather than buffering

### 3. Processing Order Change
- Moved `checkExaminationChange` to run BEFORE `checkWitnessCalled`
- This ensures examination lines are properly processed as witness events
- Prevents duplicate or missed events

### 4. Witness State Persistence
- Witness state persists across examination changes within a session
- State carries over between sessions via WitnessJurorService
- Only updates when:
  - New witness called (DIRECT EXAMINATION with witness name)
  - Witness recalled (CONTINUED examination with witness name)
  - Video deposition presented

## Expected Results

According to Feature 02D specification:
- **48 total witness examination events** should be created
- These include various combinations of:
  - DIRECT EXAMINATION (initial and continued)
  - CROSS-EXAMINATION (initial and continued)
  - REDIRECT EXAMINATION
  - RECROSS-EXAMINATION
  - VIDEO DEPOSITION presentations

## Key Patterns Detected

1. **New Witness Introduction**:
   ```
   WITNESS NAME, PLAINTIFF'S/DEFENDANT'S WITNESS, SWORN
   DIRECT EXAMINATION
   ```

2. **Examination Change (same witness)**:
   ```
   CROSS-EXAMINATION
   ```
   (Witness remains on stand from previous examination)

3. **Continued Examination**:
   ```
   WITNESS NAME, PLAINTIFF'S/DEFENDANT'S WITNESS, PREVIOUSLY SWORN
   CROSS-EXAMINATION CONTINUED
   ```

4. **Video Deposition**:
   ```
   WITNESS NAME, PLAINTIFF'S/DEFENDANT'S WITNESS
   PRESENTED BY VIDEO DEPOSITION
   ```

## Testing

A test script has been created at `src/scripts/testWitnessEvents.ts` to verify:
- Total number of witness events created
- Distribution by examination type
- Detection of all EXAMINATION and DEPOSITION lines
- Proper association with witnesses

Run with: `npx ts-node src/scripts/testWitnessEvents.ts`

## Notes

- The implementation follows the guidance from `implementation-guide-02D.md`
- Witness sworn status is tracked and updated appropriately
- Events are created for every examination type change, not just witness introductions
- The solution handles all 48 witness events described in the feature specification
