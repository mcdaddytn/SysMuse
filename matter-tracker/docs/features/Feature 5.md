Spin Control Multiple Spins

On any spin control, we should have multiple spins occur if the mouse is held down over the up or down spin control.  Currently, we need to click the spin control over and over to increment a value, but we would like also to be able to click and hold over the up or down spin and get multiple increments at a reasonable speed (perhaps around 5 increments per second when spin held down if it is customized otherwise whatever is standard).
