05:49:34   18             And, lastly, on this chart, it makes a beam

05:49:37   19   selection.    So it goes through the process of identifying

05:49:41   20   what the inputs are from the microphones, evaluating those

05:49:46   21   inputs, and from that, determining the direction from which

05:49:50   22   the sound is occurring, and then doing a beam selector to

05:49:54   23   orient and steer the beams in the direction of the sound

05:49:57   24   input.

05:49:58   25             THE COURT:   Let me interrupt at this point.

05:49:59    1              I'm aware that Mr. McAlexander has a considerable

05:50:02    2   amount of testimony yet to give, ladies and gentlemen.            And

05:50:05    3   I'm not going to keep us any later on a Friday evening.

05:50:09    4   There's not a perfect place to break this testimony, but

05:50:12    5   this is as good as any.

05:50:14    6              So, at this point, we're going to recess until

05:50:17    7   Monday morning.

05:50:20    8              Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, as you leave the

05:50:21    9   courtroom this evening, please leave your closed juror

05:50:24   10   notebooks on the table in the jury room.         Please follow all

05:50:27   11   the instructions I've given you about your conduct,

05:50:31   12   including, of course, you would expect me to remind you not

05:50:33   13   to discuss the case with anyone in any way, including the

05:50:36   14   eight of yourselves.

05:50:38   15              I'd like to have you back, in time so that we can

05:50:41   16   start promptly at 8:30 on Monday morning.          So please be

05:50:45   17   assembled and in the jury room a short time before 8:30 so

05:50:49   18   that we can begin at that time.

05:50:51   19              Please drive carefully to your homes, have a good

05:50:55   20   weekend.    And, at this time, the jury is excused for the

05:50:57   21   weekend.

05:50:58   22              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:     All rise.

05:51:24   23              (Jury out.)

05:51:25   24              THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

05:51:27   25              You may step down, Mr. McAlexander.

05:51:29    1           THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

05:51:30    2           THE COURT:     Counsel, is there anything that you're

05:51:32    3   aware of that needs to be raised with the Court before we

05:51:35    4   recess for the evening?

05:51:37    5           MS. TRUELOVE:     Nothing from the Plaintiff,

05:51:38    6   Your Honor.

05:51:38    7           MR. DACUS:     Nothing from the Defendant,

05:51:40    8   Your Honor.

05:51:40    9           THE COURT:     All right.     I'll remind you that I'll

05:51:42   10   be available Monday morning in chambers by 7:30 if there

05:51:48   11   are disputes that need to be resolved or guidance that

05:51:52   12   needs to be given.

05:51:52   13           I did not miss having to do that this morning, and

05:51:53   14   I appreciate not having to do that this morning, but we'll

05:51:53   15   see what Monday brings.

05:51:55   16           I'll also remind you to be prepared to read into

05:52:00   17   the record Monday morning the items from the list of

05:52:04   18   pre-admitted exhibits used during today's portion of the

05:52:06   19   trial, and we'll do that before I bring in the jury.

05:52:08   20           Unless there's something else, counsel, we stand

05:52:11   21   in recess until Monday morning.

05:52:13   22           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

05:52:15   23           (Recess.)
