Matter selection typeahead.  

For the matter selection dropdown, whether in the timesheet or in the IT activities page, the user should be able to type the first characters of matters, and see the resulting matters that start with the string the user typed, to narrow the selection.  From these filtered matters, the user can select a matter.  If no characters have been typed, the user would see the full list of matters.
