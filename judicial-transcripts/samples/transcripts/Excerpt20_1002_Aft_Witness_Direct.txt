04:19:32   19   A.   At the time, it was over a hundred.

04:19:38   20   Q.   And Project D only had about a handful, right?

04:19:47   21   A.   Less than five as of December 2011.

04:19:52   22            (Videoclip ends.)

04:19:56   23            THE COURT:    Does that complete this witness by

04:19:58   24   deposition, counsel?

04:19:59   25            MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:     Yes, Your Honor.

04:20:00    1             THE COURT:    All right.    Ladies and gentlemen,

04:20:03    2   before we proceed with the next Plaintiff's witness, we're

04:20:06    3   going to take a short recess.

04:20:08    4             If you will simply leave your notebooks closed and

04:20:11    5   in your chairs, follow all the instructions I've given you

04:20:15    6   about your conduct, including not to discuss the case with

04:20:17    7   each other, we'll try to make this relatively short,

04:20:21    8   approximately 10 minutes, and we'll be back to proceed with

04:20:24    9   the Plaintiff's next witness at that time.

04:20:25   10             With those instructions, the jury is excused for

04:20:28   11   recess.

04:20:28   12             COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

04:20:29   13             (Jury out.)

04:20:56   14             THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

04:20:56   15             Plaintiff, who will your next witness be?

04:21:01   16             MR. FABRICANT:    Your Honor, we have additional

04:21:03   17   video depositions today.      Mr. Lambrianakos has the times of

04:21:09   18   those depositions.

04:21:10   19             THE COURT:    Tell me what those are.       I'd like to

04:21:13   20   get some idea of what we have for the rest of the day.

04:21:15   21             MR. FABRICANT:    Yes, sir.

04:21:16   22             THE COURT:    When -- when do you expect your

04:21:18   23   expert, Mr. Alexander [sic] to go on?

04:21:21   24             MR. FABRICANT:    Your Honor, in light of the time

04:21:22   25   and the deposition videos that we have, we would intend to

04:21:26    1   start Mr. McAlexander first thing Monday.

04:21:29    2           THE COURT:     All right.     Let me hear about the

04:21:31    3   remaining witnesses by deposition.

04:21:34    4           MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:      Your Honor, we have Amit

04:21:37    5   Chhetri for approximately 27 minutes; Mr. Wai Chu for

04:21:41    6   approximately 13 minutes; Mr. Carlo Murgia for

04:21:49    7   approximately 13 minutes; and Mr. Philip Hilmes for

04:21:54    8   approximately 18 minutes.      Approximately an hour and 10

04:22:00    9   minutes total, Your Honor.

04:22:01   10           THE COURT:     I get an hour and 11.       Okay.

04:22:09   11           All right.     That tells me what I need to know.

04:22:11   12   We'll take a short recess, and then we'll return.

04:22:13   13           The Court stands in recess.

04:22:15   14           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

04:47:06   18           THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

04:47:07   19           Mr. Rubino, do I understand you're going to

04:47:19   20   directly examine the next witness?

04:47:21   21           MR. RUBINO:     Yes, Your Honor.

04:47:22   22           THE COURT:     You may go to the podium and set up.

04:47:24   23           If there are binders to pass out, let's get those

04:47:29   24   done.

04:47:29   25           And in the meantime, let's bring in the jury.
