05:42:18   17               MR. DACUS:   That's all I have, Your Honor.       I pass

05:42:19   18   the witness.

05:42:20   19               THE COURT:   All right.   Ladies and gentlemen,

05:42:22   20   we're going to take advantage of this opportunity to recess

05:42:26   21   for the day.     We're not going to start the

05:42:28   22   cross-examination this late in the afternoon.          We'll begin

 
05:43:10   12   it with anyone, including yourselves.

05:43:13   13           With that, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

05:43:17   14   you're excused until tomorrow morning.

05:43:21   15           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

05:43:26   16           (Jury out.)

05:43:27   17           THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

05:43:44   18           Mr. McGavock, you can step down.

05:43:47   19           THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

05:43:49   20           THE COURT:     Counsel, for your information,

05:43:51   21   according to the Court's records, Plaintiff has 1 hour and

05:43:57   22   25 minutes remaining.     Defendant has 1 hour and 36 minutes

05:44:00   23   remaining.


05:47:14    4   file it overnight.

05:47:17    5              Are there questions from either party at this

05:47:18    6   juncture before we recess for the evening?

05:47:22    7              MS. TRUELOVE:   Just to be clear, Your Honor,

05:47:24    8   your -- your intention is to have the informal charge

05:47:27    9   conference.    And then the Court will provide us with its

05:47:29   10   charge tomorrow afternoon, and then we will come back and

05:47:32   11   put objections on the record tomorrow?

05:47:34   12              THE COURT:   I intend to finish the formal charge

05:47:37   13   conference tomorrow so that Thursday morning we can begin


05:47:56   19   forward with those on Wednesday.       It will be first thing

05:48:00   20   Thursday morning.

05:48:00   21              MS. TRUELOVE:   That's all I have, Your Honor.

05:48:02   22              THE COURT:   Do -- do the parties know at this

05:48:04   23   juncture who is going to be presenting their closing

05:48:06   24   arguments?

05:48:08   25              MS. TRUELOVE:   I believe we do, yes, Your Honor.

05:48:10    1   Mr. Fabricant.

05:48:12    2              THE COURT:   All right.

05:48:13    3              MR. FABRICANT:      Yes, Your Honor, I will for the

05:48:14    4   Plaintiff, Your Honor.

05:48:15    5              THE COURT:   First and second Plaintiff's argument?

05:48:17    6              MR. FABRICANT:      Yes, Your Honor.

05:48:17    7              THE COURT:   Mr. Dacus, do the Defendants have --

05:48:20    8   have they made that decision?

05:48:21    9              MR. DACUS:   I don't know definitively, but likely

05:48:24   10   Mr. Hadden and I will split it, Your Honor.

05:48:27   11              THE COURT:   All right.

05:48:27   12              MR. DACUS:   And, Your Honor, I do have a question

05:48:29   13   with respect to 50(a), if I could.

05:48:29   14              THE COURT:   Yes.

05:48:31   15              MR. DACUS:   The Court said file something by

05:48:32   16   morning.    I'm a little concerned about that because --

05:48:35   17              THE COURT:   Midnight tonight.

05:48:37   18              MR. DACUS:   By midnight tonight?      Even -- even

05:48:37   19   without the evidence being closed, you would like our 50(a)

05:48:42   20   motions?    My question was, can we wait --

05:48:44   21              THE COURT:   I'm not going to stop and have a

05:48:47   22   multi-hour delay after the rebuttal case closes before I

05:48:50   23   take up the 50(a) motions.

05:48:52   24              MR. DACUS:   Understood completely, Your Honor.         So

05:48:54   25   my question was -- and, obviously, the Court can say no --

05:48:57    1   is can we file it as soon as evidence closes --

05:49:00    2           THE COURT:     Well, if you want me to have an

05:49:01    3   opportunity to read it -- what I'm trying to do is to avoid


05:49:17    8   Otherwise, I'll just simply say, give me a concise oral

05:49:21    9   argument from the podium, and we'll let that suffice.

05:49:24   10           MR. DACUS:     How about if we file something before

05:49:26   11   midnight tonight, Your Honor; will that work?

05:49:28   12           THE COURT:     If you file it before midnight, I'll

05:49:31   13   have an opportunity to look at it.

05:49:33   14           MR. DACUS:     Thank you very much for that

05:49:34   15   opportunity.

05:49:34   16           MR. HADDEN:     Thank you.

05:49:34   17           THE COURT:     Anything from anybody else?

05:49:37   18           MS. TRUELOVE:     No, Your Honor.

05:49:38   19           THE COURT:     If not, we stand in recess until

05:49:41   20   tomorrow morning.

05:49:42   21           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.
