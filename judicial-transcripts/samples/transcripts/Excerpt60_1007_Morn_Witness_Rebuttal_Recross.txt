10:02:06    2   A.   After 20 years of active research, however, we cannot

10:02:10    3   claim that microphone array processing has had the success

10:02:13    4   many of us hoped for, and many will wonder when the great

10:02:17    5   breakthrough in microphone array processing will finally

10:02:20    6   come, if ever.

10:02:22    7               MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:    Pass the witness.

10:02:23    8               THE COURT:    Further cross-examination?

10:02:29    9               MR. HADDEN:    Just one question, Your Honor.

10:02:29   10                             RECROSS-EXAMINATION

10:02:39   11   BY MR. HADDEN:

10:02:39   12   Q.   That paragraph that we were just looking for was from

10:02:43   13   2001, right, Mr. McAlexander?

10:02:46   14   A.   Yes.    Yes, that's correct.

10:02:47   15   Q.   And you mentioned some commercial success.         It's a

10:02:53   16   fact, isn't it, Mr. McAlexander, that Professor Li has not

10:02:59   17   had any commercial success?

10:03:00   18   A.   I would say that's correct.        I didn't represent that.

10:03:06   19               MR. HADDEN:    Thank you.

10:03:06   20               THE COURT:    You pass the witness?

10:03:07   21               MR. HADDEN:    Pass the witness.    Sorry, Your Honor.

10:03:10   22               MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:    Nothing further, Your Honor.

10:03:12   23               THE COURT:    Any redirect?

10:03:13   24               MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:    No, Your Honor.

10:03:13   25               THE COURT:    All right.    You may step down,

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 338 Filed 10/09/20 Page 74 of 82 PageID #: 19634
                                                                                   1232



10:03:15    1   Mr. McAlexander.

10:03:16    2            THE WITNESS:     Thank you, sir.

10:03:17    3            THE COURT:     You're quite welcome.

10:03:19    4            Plaintiff, call your next rebuttal witness.

10:03:22    5            MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:     No further witnesses,

10:03:23    6   Your Honor.

10:03:23    7            THE COURT:     Does the Plaintiff rest its rebuttal

10:03:25    8   case?

10:03:26    9            MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:     Yes, Your Honor, Plaintiff

10:03:27   10   rests.

10:03:27   11            THE COURT:     All right.   Ladies and gentlemen of

10:03:32   12   the jury, this means you have now heard all the evidence in

10:03:36   13   this case.

10:03:39   14            There are several things that the Court's required

10:03:41   15   to take up with counsel that will be taken up and

10:03:47   16   considered outside of your presence.        It's a part of every

10:03:51   17   trial.



10:05:32   24             And with that, ladies and gentlemen, I will see

10:05:34   25   you in the morning.    You're excused for the remainder of

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 338 Filed 10/09/20 Page 76 of 82 PageID #: 19636
                                                                                   1234



10:05:36    1   the day.

10:05:37    2              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:     All rise.

10:05:41    3              (Jury out.)

10:05:42    4              THE COURT:    Please be seated.

10:06:03    5              Mr. McGavock, if you're going to remain in the

10:06:12    6   gallery, you need to wear a mask, sir.         I sent somebody out

10:06:17    7   yesterday, so I'm trying to be consistent across the board

10:06:20    8   for everyone's well-being.

10:06:21    9              Also, Plaintiffs -- or, Plaintiff, I have seen and

10:06:30   10   heard no evidence on Claim 3.       I assume you have

10:06:35   11   effectively dropped Claim 3 from your case, even though the

10:06:38   12   last filing on the record in this case indicates Claims 1,

10:06:44   13   3, and 8 would be the asserted claims for trial.

10:06:46   14              I need to clean up the record at this point.          What

10:06:50   15   is Plaintiff's posture on Claim 3?

10:06:54   16              MR. FABRICANT:    Yes, Your Honor.      We had advised

10:06:56   17   defense counsel prior to the commencement of the trial, and

10:07:00   18   I believe we advised the Court, that Claim 3 would be

10:07:03   19   withdrawn and was not being asserted in this -- in this

10:07:05   20   case.

10:07:05   21              THE COURT:    Well, if you advised the Court, the

10:07:09   22   message didn't get to me, and you certainly didn't do it in

10:07:12   23   writing.    But we not have it on the record.        And having

10:07:13   24   advised opposing counsel before the trial started that you

10:07:16   25   were dropping Claim 3, I'll consider that we've been to

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 338 Filed 10/09/20 Page 77 of 82 PageID #: 19637
                                                                                   1235



10:07:20    1   trial on Claims 1 and 8 only and not Claim 3.

10:07:23    2           MR. FABRICANT:      Yes, Your Honor.

10:07:24    3           THE COURT:     Thank you.

10:07:24    4           Counsel, we're going to recess at this point until

10:07:44    5   12:00 noon.   At noon, I will reconvene and take up any

10:07:48    6   motions under Rule 50(a) that either party cares to offer.


10:08:52   22           I'd like a recitation from both sides now as to

10:08:57   23   what you anticipate each side will be bringing forward with

10:09:00   24   regard to the inequitable conduct claim that will be

10:09:03   25   presented in a bench trial to the Court.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 338 Filed 10/09/20 Page 78 of 82 PageID #: 19638
                                                                                   1236



10:09:06    1             Let me hear from Defendant first.

10:09:09    2             MS. DOAN:    Yes, Your Honor.     May I take the

10:09:12    3   podium?

10:09:13    4             THE COURT:    Please from the podium, Ms. Doan.

10:09:16    5             MS. DOAN:    Your Honor, we'd like to have two -- we

10:09:19    6   advised the Plaintiff last night we have two witnesses.

10:09:22    7   We're crossing Dr. Peter Li briefly, and then we'd like to

10:09:28    8   present Mr. Nick Godici.

10:09:29    9             We do have deposition testimony from the

10:09:31   10   prosecuting attorney, Your Honor.        We can play it for you,

10:09:35   11   if you wish, or we can submit it in writing.          It's at the

10:09:37   12   Court's pleasure.

10:09:39   13             THE COURT:    If you submit that testimony in

10:09:41   14   writing, what do you anticipate the length of your live

10:09:45   15   testimony to be?

10:09:46   16             MS. DOAN:    We expect it to be approximately an

10:09:48   17   hour, Your Honor.

10:09:49   18             THE COURT:    All right.   In light of that, what can

10:09:52   19   I expect from the Plaintiff with regard to the inequitable

10:09:54   20   conduct issue?     Obviously, the Court's trying to determine

10:09:56   21   when and how to schedule this.

10:09:58   22             MR. FABRICANT:    Well, it's obviously the

10:10:00   23   Defendants' burden by clear and convincing evidence, so


10:10:59   17            So with regard to any deposition witnesses, I'll

10:11:01   18   take submissions and counter-submissions from the

10:11:05   19   transcripts from the parties.       And we'll limit the actual

10:11:10   20   live presentation to Dr. Li and the expert -- I've

10:11:16   21   forgotten his name.

10:11:18   22            MS. DOAN:    Nicholas Godici, Your Honor.

10:11:20   23            THE COURT:    Mr. Godici.

10:11:21   24            With that, counsel, I would anticipate that with

10:11:27   25   my final instructions and closing, the case will get to the

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 338 Filed 10/09/20 Page 80 of 82 PageID #: 19640
                                                                                   1238



10:11:31    1   jury sometime before, but probably not a great deal before,

10:11:36    2   lunch tomorrow.

10:11:38    3            And with that in mind, it would be my plan, as I

10:11:41    4   sit here now -- subject to change, but as I sit here now,

10:11:45    5   it would be my plan after the lunch break tomorrow to put

10:11:47    6   on the inequitable conduct portion of the trial as a bench

10:11:51    7   trial.

10:11:51    8            MS. DOAN:    Yes, Your Honor.

10:11:53    9            THE COURT:    All right.    So prepare your -- prepare

10:11:54   10   yourselves accordingly.

10:11:56   11            MS. DOAN:    We will, Your Honor.

10:11:57   12            One further clarification.       Would you like -- some

10:12:00   13   of the trial testimony that's been offered this week also

10:12:03   14   affects the inequitable conduct trial portion, as well.

10:12:06   15   Would you like us to submit that portion in writing or --

10:12:09   16            THE COURT:    I've certainly heard it and been

10:12:13   17   exposed to it throughout the trial.        I would simply suggest

10:12:15   18   you reference that in your argument.        There'll be a final

10:12:19   19   argument at the end of the --

10:12:21   20            MS. DOAN:    Yes, Your Honor.

10:12:22   21            THE COURT:    -- inequitable conduct.       If there's

10:12:25   22   something in your argument that I think the Court would

10:12:29   23   benefit from by having it submitted in writing, as opposed

10:12:29   24   to just refreshing the Court's recollection about what was

10:12:33   25   said during the jury trial, I'll ask for it.

10:12:35    1            MS. DOAN:    Thank you, Your Honor.

10:12:36    2            MR. FABRICANT:     Your Honor, do the Court's

10:12:39    3   purported rules with respect to the exchange of exhibits

10:12:43    4   and demonstratives apply?

10:12:45    5            THE COURT:    Absolutely.     I don't want any

10:12:47    6   surprises tomorrow.

10:12:48    7            MR. FABRICANT:     Thank you.

10:12:48    8            THE COURT:    All right.    Is there anything further

10:12:50    9   from either Plaintiff or Defendant before we recess for

10:12:53   10   lunch?

10:12:53   11            MR. FABRICANT:     Nothing from the Plaintiff.

10:12:55   12            MR. DACUS:    Nothing from Amazon, Judge.

10:12:59   13            THE COURT:    We stand in recess until noon.

10:13:02   14            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.
