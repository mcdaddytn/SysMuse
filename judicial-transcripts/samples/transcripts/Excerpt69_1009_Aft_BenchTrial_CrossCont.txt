03:28:47    1            (Recess.)

03:28:56    2            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

03:28:57    3            THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

03:28:59    4            All right.     Mr. Lambrianakos, please continue.

03:29:08    5   Q.   (By Mr. Lambrianakos)    Mr. Godici, we saw that in the

03:29:11    6   reissue of the '756 into the '059 [sic] there was an

03:29:19    7   amendment to the delay step, correct?

03:29:21    8   A.   I'd have to -- I'd have to look at that.         We can tell

03:29:26    9   that very easily by looking at the claim of the '049

03:29:31   10   indicating what's in brackets and what's in italics.

03:29:35   11            MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:     PTX-1, please, Claim 1.        Zoom

03:29:40   12   in on the delay step quickly, please.

03:29:44   13   Q.   (By Mr. Lambrianakos)    So do you see at Line 55

03:30:09   14   "arbitrary numbers"?

03:30:12   15   A.   Yes, I see that.
