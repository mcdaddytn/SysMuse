10:45:57   22            I think it also gives great freedom to the user to

10:46:00   23   know that -- whether you are near it or far away from it it

10:46:04   24   can still pick up and discern, is great value added from a

10:46:08   25   technology standpoint, because there's a lot of things you

10:46:11    1   can do with it once it can discern the words that you're

10:46:15    2   saying.

10:46:15    3   Q.   Thank you, Mr. McAlexander.

10:46:57   14   BY MR. HADDEN:

10:46:57   15   Q.   Good morning, Mr. McAlexander.

10:46:58   16   A.   Good morning, sir.

10:46:59   17   Q.   You're not an expert in adaptive beamforming, are you?

10:47:02   18   A.   Not in adaptive beamforming, per se, no.

10:47:05   19   Q.   And you've not authored any publications regarding

10:47:09   20   adaptive beamforming, have you?

10:47:10   21   A.   That's correct, no.

10:47:11   22   Q.   And you've not taught any classes regarding adaptive

10:47:14   23   beamforming, have you?

10:47:15   24   A.   That's also correct.

10:47:16   25   Q.   In fact, you haven't even taken any classes related to

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 332 Filed 10/09/20 Page 83 of 134 PageID #: 18995
                                                                                     659



10:47:20    1   adaptive beamforming, have you, Mr. McAlexander?

10:47:22    2   A.    Not any official classes, no.

10:47:24    3   Q.    Okay.    And, in fact, you have no experience with

10:47:26    4   adaptive beamforming as it is used in these patents, do

10:47:30    5   you, Mr. McAlexander?

10:47:31    6   A.    Not correct.    As I mentioned, I have used -- in

10:47:34    7   acoustic design of systems, I have used equipment.            I

10:47:38    8   haven't designed the actual construct of the -- the

10:47:42    9   adaptive beamformer itself, but I've used it.

10:47:44   10   Q.    Well, do you recall being -- having your deposition

10:47:47   11   taken in this case, Mr. McAlexander?

10:47:49   12   A.    Certainly.
