  "contextDescription": "Image processing patents cover algorithms and systems for manipulating captured images. Key areas include denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, tone mapping, color correction, and computational photography. These techniques are implemented in ISPs (Image Signal Processors), camera apps, and cloud photo services. Patent value often relates to implementation in mobile ISPs (Qualcomm, Apple, MediaTek) or software platforms (Google Photos, Adobe).",
