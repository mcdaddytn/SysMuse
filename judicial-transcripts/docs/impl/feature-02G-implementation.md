# Feature 02G Implementation Guide

## Overview
Feature 02G implements SessionSection parsing to capture and store transcript summary sections (header, court info, case title, appearances, etc.) and certification sections separately from the main proceedings content.

## Current Status (Completed)

### Schema Changes
1. **Added SessionSection model** in `prisma/schema.prisma`
   - Links to Session and Trial
   - Stores sectionType, sectionText, orderIndex, and metadata (JSON)
   - Section types: HEADER, COURT_AND_DIVISION, CASE_TITLE, SESSION_INFO, JUDGE_INFO, APPEARANCES, COURT_PERSONNEL, CERTIFICATION

2. **Updated Page model**
   - Added `parsedTrialLine` field (moved from Line model)
   - Captures trial line number from second line of 2-line page headers

3. **Line model updates**
   - Added `linePrefix` field to store raw prefix (timestamp + line number)
   - Added `dateTime` field (combines session date with timestamp)
   - Removed `parsedTrialLine` (moved to Page)

### Implementation

1. **Created SessionSectionParser** (`src/parsers/SessionSectionParser.ts`)
   - Identifies and extracts different section types from summary
   - Extracts metadata for each section type
   - `cleanSectionText()` method to remove line prefixes and page headers

2. **Updated TranscriptParser** (`src/parsers/TranscriptParser.ts`)
   - Integrates SessionSectionParser
   - Detects CERTIFICATION section (exact match on "CERTIFICATION")
   - Stores linePrefix and calculates dateTime for lines
   - Handles 2-line page headers for Vocalife transcripts

3. **Updated LineParser** (`src/parsers/LineParser.ts`)
   - Returns linePrefix in ParsedLine interface
   - Captures full prefix before extracting text content

## Known Issues (To Fix in Feature 02H)

### 1. Incomplete Line Prefix Cleaning in SessionSections
- Some SessionSection records still contain line prefixes (e.g., "17     FOR THE PLAINTIFF:")
- The cleanSectionText() method needs improvement to handle all line prefix patterns
- Particularly affects APPEARANCES sections (ids 6, 14, etc.)

### 2. Missing Line Records for SUMMARY and CERTIFICATION
- Currently only PROCEEDINGS lines are stored in the Line table
- SUMMARY section lines are parsed but not stored as Line records
- CERTIFICATION section lines are completely skipped
- All 37,319 lines in database are marked as documentSection='PROCEEDINGS'

### 3. Document Section Tracking
- Need to properly set documentSection for all lines
- Should have UNKNOWN, SUMMARY, PROCEEDINGS, and CERTIFICATION sections represented

## Technical Details

### Page Header Handling
- Vocalife uses 2-line headers:
  ```
  Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 328 Filed 10/09/20 Page 19 of 125 PageID #: 18355
  19
  ```
- First line contains case info, page number, PageID
- Second line is parsedTrialLine (single number)

### Line Prefix Formats
- PROCEEDINGS: "HH:MM:SS   NN" (13 characters)
- SUMMARY: "     NN" (7 characters)
- Both formats are captured in linePrefix field

### Section Detection Logic
1. Lines 0-100 (or until "P R O C E E D I N G S"): SUMMARY
2. After "P R O C E E D I N G S": PROCEEDINGS
3. When "CERTIFICATION" found: CERTIFICATION (to end of file)

## Testing Results
- ✅ SessionSections created (96 records for 12 sessions)
- ✅ Line.linePrefix captured
- ✅ Line.dateTime set (37,312 lines)
- ✅ Page.parsedTrialLine captured from 2-line headers
- ⚠️ Some SessionSection.sectionText still has line prefixes
- ❌ No SUMMARY or CERTIFICATION lines in Line table

## Files Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/parsers/SessionSectionParser.ts` (new)
- `src/parsers/TranscriptParser.ts`
- `src/parsers/LineParser.ts`
- `src/types/config.types.ts`
