12:12:34    2            (Jury out.)

12:12:36    3            (Jury trial.)

12:12:36    4            COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

12:12:40    5            THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

12:12:55    6            Counsel, we have received a note from the jury.

12:13:00    7            I'll read it to you, and it reads as follows:

12:13:08    8            Can we see the code evidence, question mark?

12:13:12    9   Thanks, Elizabeth Edwards.

12:13:15   10            Who I recall to be Juror No. 2.

12:13:18   11            I'll mark the note with a No. 1 in the upper

12:13:21   12   right-hand corner for identification, and I'll hand the

12:13:25   13   original note to the courtroom deputy.

12:13:26   14            Counsel, you can either discuss among yourselves

12:13:29   15   what you think the code evidence should be, and if we can

12:13:32   16   agree on a set of exhibits, I'll send them back.           Or I'm

12:13:36   17   happy to send the jury another note, and ask them to be

12:13:39   18   more specific about what they're asking for, although I'm

12:13:42   19   not particularly sure what we might get in response to

12:13:46   20   that.   I'm open to suggestions.

12:13:55   21            MR. FABRICANT:     I don't remember a lot of code

12:13:57   22   evidence in the record.

12:14:04   23            I don't remember a lot of exhibits with source

12:14:08   24   code.

12:14:08   25            THE COURT:    Well, before we all start talking at

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 341 Filed 10/09/20 Page 4 of 136 PageID #: 19799
                                                                                   1397



12:14:11    1   one time, let's go off the record.

12:14:14    2             (Off-the-record discussion.)

12:19:38    3             THE COURT:    All right.   Let's go back on the

12:19:40    4   record.

12:19:40    5             Counsel have met and conferred off the record with

12:19:44    6   regard to an appropriate response to the jury's note.

12:19:47    7   There seems to be an indication that there may be agreement

12:19:50    8   between the parties as to how best to respond.            I'm happy

12:19:53    9   to hear from either or both sides on this.

12:19:53   10             MR. FABRICANT:    Your Honor, we propose Plaintiff's

12:19:56   11   Exhibit 1378 and Plaintiff's Exhibit 386.

12:19:59   12             And I believe defense counsel has agreed.

12:20:02   13             THE COURT:    Give me those again, Mr. Fabricant.

12:20:05   14             MR. FABRICANT:    Yes, Your Honor.      1378.

12:20:08   15             THE COURT:    Plaintiff or Defendant?

12:20:09   16             MR. FABRICANT:    Plaintiff.    Plaintiff 1378 and

12:20:14   17   Plaintiff 386.

12:20:19   18             THE COURT:    All right.   Mr. Hadden, Mr. Re, do you

12:20:25   19   all agree with that?

12:20:27   20             MR. LAQUER:    Defendants agree, Your Honor.

12:22:00   21             THE COURT:    All right.   You all have a seat then.

12:22:02   22             Counsel, here's a written version of my intended

12:22:04   23   response based on what you just told me.

12:22:06   24             Members of the jury, in response to your note

12:22:08   25   asking for, quote, code evidence, close quote, I am sending

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 341 Filed 10/09/20 Page 5 of 136 PageID #: 19800
                                                                                   1398



12:22:13    1   you the following exhibits:      PTX-1378 and PTX-386.        Signed

12:22:21    2   by me.

12:22:21    3             And we will attach those two Plaintiff's exhibits

12:22:24    4   to this response.

12:22:25    5             Does Plaintiff have any objection to me sending

12:22:30    6   this response and those exhibits to the jury?

12:22:33    7             MR. FABRICANT:    No objection, Your Honor.

12:22:34    8             THE COURT:   Any objection from Defendant?

12:22:35    9             MR. DACUS:   No, Your Honor.      Thank you.

12:22:37   10             THE COURT:   Then I'll sign the original written

12:22:40   11   response.

12:22:40   12             Ms. Lockhart, do you have those two exhibits?

12:22:43   13             COURTROOM DEPUTY:     No, I haven't pulled them yet.

12:22:45   14             THE COURT:   Let's get those two exhibits, please.

12:23:52   15             All right.   I have those two physical exhibits.          I

12:23:56   16   have the printed and signed responsive note.

12:23:58   17             I will hand all of this to the Court Security

12:24:00   18   Officer and direct him to deliver it to the jury.

12:24:02   19             All right.   Counsel, pending either another note

12:24:11   20   from the jury or the return of a verdict, we stand in

12:24:13   21   recess.

12:24:14   22             I intend to start the bench trial in approximately

12:24:18   23   30 minutes, at 1:00 o'clock.

12:24:20   24             We stand in recess.

12:24:22   25             COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.
