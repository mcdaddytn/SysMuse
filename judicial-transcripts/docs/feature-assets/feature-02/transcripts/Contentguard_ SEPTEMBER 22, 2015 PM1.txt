2                    (Jury out.)

3                    COURT SECURITY OFFICER:          All rise.

4                    THE COURT:      Be seated, please.

5                    All right.      Does the Plaintiff have any motion or

6       motions to offer under Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of

7       Civil Procedure?

8                    MR. THOMAS:      We do under 50(a), Your Honor.

9                    THE COURT:      50(a).     I'm sorry.      Did I said 50(b)?

10      I apologize.      I'm ahead of myself.          That will come later,

11      I'm sure.     50(a).

12                   MR. THOMAS:      We do, Your Honor.         And they'll be

13      presented by Mr. Cote and then Mr. Dehoney and then

14      Mr. Hasenour.

15                   But before that, Your Honor, we'd like to see if

16      our witnesses could be released.

17                   THE COURT:      Are there any witnesses you've not

18      asked previously to have released?

19                   MR. THOMAS:      Yes, there are, Your Honor.            And that

20      would be Dr. Goodrich and Dr. Martin, and I think that's the

21      only ones.      Did we ask that Dr. Teece be released?

22                   MR. COTE:      I don't believe -- I believe we did.

23                   THE COURT:      Let's just do this, Mr. Thomas:               All

24      the Plaintiff's witnesses are released.

25                   MR. THOMAS:      I was hoping you were going to say

1       that, Your Honor.        Thank you.

2                    THE COURT:      Do the Defendants have any witnesses

3       similarly situated?

4                    MR. MALECEK:       Your Honor, the only one I can think

5       of is Jamie Rosenberg, the corporate representative of --

6                    THE COURT:      He's not released.         We want our

7       corporate representatives here.

8                    MR. MALECEK:       Right.    So in case I've forgotten

9       someone, may I have the same ruling --

10                   THE COURT:      You may have the same blanket order.

11      Other than corporate representatives, all Defendants'

12      witnesses are hereby released.

13                   MR. MALECEK:       Thank you, Your Honor.

14                   THE COURT:      All right.      Let's proceed with the

15      motions under 50(a).

16                   And counsel for Plaintiff, it doesn't matter what

17      order you want to go in, just go to the podium and present

18      them.

19                   MR. COTE:      We'll do infringement, validity, and

20      damages.

21                   THE COURT:      All right.      Proceed, Counsel.

22                   Please identify each counsel for the record before

23      you begin.

24                   MR. HASENOUR:       Seth Hasenour, Your Honor, from

25      Plaintiff, ContentGuard.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 7 of 57 PageID #: 60459   7



1                    THE COURT:      Proceed.

2                    MR. HASENOUR:       ContentGuard moves for judgment as

3       a matter of law on infringement of the asserted claims

4       because Google and Samsung failed to provide any evidence on

5       which a reasonable juror could reach a conclusion that any

6       of the asserted claims are not infringed.

7                    First, all of Samsung's products have Google Play

8       Movies & TV and the Books applications preinstalled.

9       Dr. Goodrich provided an element-by-element analysis for the

10      claims -- of each of the asserted claims for the '859, '956,

11      '007, and '072 patents.

12                   Dr. Martin provided an element-by-element analysis

13      for each of the claims of the '053 patent.                 Dr. Clark was

14      the only witness who testified on non-infringement, and he

15      agreed that there was no dispute about how the Google Play

16      Movies and Books systems worked.

17                   The only non-infringement defenses presented in

18      this case was first that the usage rights are not attached

19      or treated as attached.          However, Dr. Clark's interpretation

20      of attached or treated as attached would require permanent

21      attachment contrary to the Court's Markman order in this

22      case.

23                   In addition, Dr. Clark testified that the -- one

24      can't exist independently of the other and be considered

25      attached, which is just another way of arguing a permanent
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 8 of 57 PageID #: 60460   8



1       attachment point.

2                    Moreover, there's substantial evidence in this

3       case, including from Widevine's CEO, Brian Baker, that the

4       license is tied and bound to the content through the asset

5       ID.   And, therefore, no reasonable juror could find that the

6       license file was not attached or treated as attached to the

7       content.

8                    The second non-infringement argument dealing with

9       the argument that trust -- the device is not trusted because

10      Android devices allow access to the encrypted content.

11                   However, Dr. Clark's testimony is contrary to the

12      claim construction which requires maintaining physical

13      integrity only in support of usage rights and not at all

14      times.

15                   In addition, Dr. Clark never testified that he was

16      able to access the content as construed by the Court, which

17      is the digital information, i.e., raw bits representing a

18      digital work.

19                   And, therefore, there was no testimony that the

20      accused products do not maintain physical integrity and

21      because Dr. Clark was never able to access the unencrypted

22      content files.

23                   Therefore, no reasonable juror could find that the

24      accused products do not maintain physical integrity under

25      the Court's claim constructions.

1                    Finally, the third non-infringement argument

2       related to the content files, movies, and books requiring a

3       digital certificate.         Again, this is contrary to the Court's

4       claim construction for behavioral integrity, which only

5       requires software to include a digital certificate to be

6       installed in the repository.

7                    The Court adopted the Defendants' proposed

8       construction for behavioral integrity, and there was never

9       any suggestion that software in that construction applied to

10      content such as movies and books.

11                   In addition, Dr. Clark never testified that those

12      content files, such as movies and books, are installed in

13      the repository.       So, therefore, no reasonable juror could

14      find that the content must include the digital certificate

15      to maintain behavioral integrity under the Court's claim

16      constructions.

17                   THE COURT:      All right.      Let me hear a response

18      from the Defendants.

19                   MS. WILLIAMS:       Your Honor, we can respond and

20      offer our own motion for judgment as a matter of law at the

21      same time.

22                   THE COURT:      That will be fine on the -- on the

23      infringement topic.

24                   MS. WILLIAMS:       Yes, Your Honor.

25                   THE COURT:      Proceed.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 10 of 57 PageID #: 60462 10



1                   MS. WILLIAMS:       Specifically on direct

2      infringement, the evidence presented at trial was

3      insufficient for a reasonable jury to find against Google on

4      direct infringement as it showed that several elements of

5      the asserted patent claims are not present in the accused

6      Google Play Movies & TV app, Google Play Books app, or

7      Google Play servers.

8                   For example, the evidence would not permit a

9      finding that the accused apps and servers have the usage

10      rights required by each of the asserted patent claims.                    The

11      factual issue of how the accused apps and servers operate

12      was undisputed.

13                   The evidence was clear that usage rights are not

14      attached or treated as attached to the digital content as

15      required by this Court's claim construction.                 But rather

16      that there's a mere reference or association between the

17      license and content.

18                   The undisputed evidence from Drs. Goodrich and

19      Martin, as well as Dr. Clark, showed that the accused apps

20      and servers were transmitted separately from different

21      servers or stored separately on the user's device and can be

22      moved between devices separately.

23                   The usage rights are not attached or treated as

24      attached to the content as the license asset ID relied on by

25      Plaintiff is merely a reference to the associated content.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 11 of 57 PageID #: 60463 11



1                   The evidence was also insufficient to permit a

2      reasonable jury to find that the repository or trusted

3      element is meant -- is met by the accused apps or servers

4      because they do not meet the physical integrity requirement.

5                   The undisputed evidence presented at trial was

6      that information about the digital content and license

7      information can be accessed with the use of widely available

8      software tools.        Dr. Martin even testified that he can move

9      a content file to another location or even another device.

10      The accused apps and servers thus clearly do not prevent

11      access to information.

12                   Further, no reasonable jury could find the

13      behavioral integrity element present.               The evidence showed

14      that the accused apps and servers transfer -- excuse me --

15      permit installation of software with no signed digital

16      message, namely, the digital content itself.

17                   To the extent ContentGuard presented evidence

18      regarding LOAS certificates, Dr. Franklin testified that he

19      had no evidence that such certificates were used in any

20      communications between Google servers and devices.

21                   ContentGuard also failed to present any evidence

22      of equivalents, and so judgment as a matter of law is also

23      warranted on that issue.

24                   For the '053 patent, the meta-rights patent, the

25      evidence is insufficient for the jury to conclude that the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 12 of 57 PageID #: 60464 12



1      accused Google servers contained meta-rights.                 Judgment as a

2      matter of law of no infringement should also be granted for

3      all streaming content on the accused Google Play Movies & TV

4      app and Google servers.

5                   The testimony of Dr. Goodrich and Dr. Franklin was

6      that streaming content for either the Classic or Modular

7      Widevine systems require the user device to get a license

8      renewal or reapproval from Google servers every 60 seconds.

9                   And, Your Honor, we would also argue that Google

10      is further entitled to judgment as a matter of law on

11      ContentGuard's theory of infringement by attribution.

12                   First, there was no evidence presented at trial

13      from which a jury could find any actual infringement by

14      Google customers.

15                   In addition, ContentGuard failed to present

16      evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Google

17      conditions use of the Google Play Movies & TV app or the

18      Google Play Books app on the performance of any steps at the

19      accused patented method.

20                   Finally, ContentGuard also failed to present

21      sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Google

22      establishes the manner or timing of the customer's

23      performance of any steps of the patented method.

24                   And we also have a motion on indirect

25      infringement, but I can save that for later if Your Honor
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 13 of 57 PageID #: 60465 13



1      would like.

2                   THE COURT:      No.     I'd prefer to hear all the

3      infringement arguments at one time.

4                   MS. WILLIAMS:         Yes, Your Honor.

5                   Google also seeks judgment as a matter of law on

6      no induced infringement.

7                   ContentGuard failed to submit evidence from which

8      a reasonable jury could find that Google's customers

9      actually infringe the asserted patent claims.

10                   In addition, because the accused apps do not

11      directly infringe, their use by third parties cannot

12      constitute indirect infringement as well.

13                   ContentGuard also failed to submit evidence

14      sufficient to support a jury conclusion that Google took any

15      affirmative action with specific intent to cause its

16      customers to infringe.

17                   ContentGuard also failed to present evidence

18      sufficient to permit the conclusion that Google was aware of

19      the '072 patent, which is the only patent not subject to the

20      Court's pre-suit damages limitation in the summary judgment

21      order.

22                   They failed to present evidence that Google was

23      aware of this patent prior to May 2012, and there was no

24      evidence submitted at trial sufficient to permit a

25      reasonable jury to find that Google knew that the acts that
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 14 of 57 PageID #: 60466 14



1      caused others to take would infringe the asserted patents.

2                   In addition, in its jury instruction proposals,

3      ContentGuard submitted a willful blindness instruction.

4                   Google does not believe that this issue should go

5      to the jury, as it was not disclosed in discovery, but

6      Google is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this

7      issue in any event.

8                   Google also requests judgment as a matter of law

9      of no contributory infringement.             The asserted patent claims

10      for contributory infringement are Claim 1 of the '859,

11      Claim 7 of the '956, and Claim 1 of the '072.

12                   As an initial matter, no reasonable jury could

13      have found that the Google Play Movies & TV app or Google

14      Play Books app have no substantial non-infringing use.                    The

15      undisputed evidence show that there are substantial

16      non-infringing uses for the accused apps.

17                   For example, evidence showed that some content is

18      available to customers with no DRM at all on Google Play

19      Books, and no reasonable jury could find no substantial

20      non-infringing uses.         The Google Play Movies & TV app also

21      can be used to stream rather than download.

22                   There was also no evidence from which a reasonable

23      jury could find that the allegedly infringing component

24      constitutes a material part of the invention.                 To the

25      contrary, testimony from ContentGuard's experts showed that
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 15 of 57 PageID #: 60467 15



1      the distribution of digital content is not technologically

2      dependent on DRM at all.

3                   In addition, the accused apps are not a material

4      part of the devices.         Because the accused apps do not

5      directly infringe any of the asserted patent claims, and

6      thus no direct infringement is possible through third

7      parties' use of the accused products and services.

8                   ContentGuard also failed to present evidence to

9      permit the conclusion that Google was aware of the '072

10      patent prior to May 2012.           There's also not sufficient

11      evidence to permit the jury to find that Google knew that

12      use of the components in the contemplated manner would

13      constitute infringement of the asserted patents.

14                   We also would move on willful infringement, Your

15      Honor, if you would like that address at that moment.

16                   THE COURT:      Let me hear arguments on willfulness

17      separately.

18                   Do you have anything else otherwise related to

19      infringement?

20                   MS. WILLIAMS:       That's all on infringement for

21      Google, Your Honor.

22                   THE COURT:      All right.      Does Samsung have a

23      separate argument to present?

24                   MR. SIROTA:       We do, in part, Your Honor.

25                   THE COURT:      All right.      I assume it will be
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 16 of 57 PageID #: 60468 16



1      supplemental and not a complete revisiting of the topics,

2      but go ahead, Mr. Sirota.

3                   MR. SIROTA:       That's correct, Your Honor.

4                   So, Your Honor, we also move for judgment as a

5      matter of law -- Samsung moves for judgment as a matter of

6      law on direct infringement, and we are -- we will join in

7      the same -- on the same issues as Google.                I won't repeat

8      them.

9                   They include non-infringement due to failure to

10      prove the presence of usage rights and the required

11      integrities for repositories or trusted systems, as well as

12      streaming, non-infringement, and also no infringement by

13      attribution.       As I said, we will not repeat what was said.

14                   One additional point that I would make is that

15      further evidence of the weakness of Plaintiff's case on

16      infringement is their strong reliance on Plaintiff's

17      Exhibit 562 which was not particularly -- was not relevant

18      to the infringement allegations that were made.

19                   In addition, Your Honor, I'd like to move for

20      judgment as a matter of law that there was no evidence in

21      the record of any direct infringements of the '072 patent,

22      which is the method claim, by either Samsung or its

23      customers.      Direct infringement is use of the apps on a

24      Samsung phone, and there was no evidence of that in the

25      record.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 17 of 57 PageID #: 60469 17



1                   There was evidence of some testing that Samsung

2      did, but no evidence that it was done in the United States.

3                   I also would like to reiterate the motion for

4      judgment as a matter of law of non-infringement under the

5      Doctrine of Equivalents.           There was no evidence or argument

6      regarding infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents for

7      any of the patents or claims that were asserted.

8                   There was no mention of equivalents,

9      function-way-result, insubstantial differences.                  It was

10      never addressed by Plaintiffs, so Doctrine of Equivalents

11      should be out of the case.

12                   I can move on now to inducement, Your Honor.                 And

13      here, ContentGuard has not introduced sufficient evidence to

14      carry its burden of proving that Samsung took any acts to

15      encourage infringement knowing that any allegedly induced

16      acts constituted patent infringement.

17                   The evidence firmly establishes Samsung's

18      knowledge, or at a minimum, strong -- a strong and

19      good-faith belief that its products and use of its products

20      did not infringe any of the ContentGuard patents, at least

21      because, as it told ContentGuard during negotiations,

22      ContentGuard was reading usage rights too broadly in

23      contradiction of the patent specification.

24                   Both James Baker of ContentGuard and James Kwak of

25      Samsung testified of that effect, testified that --
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 18 of 57 PageID #: 60470 18



1      testified that ContentGuard told Samsung that all it had to

2      show was that the usage rights are associated with the

3      content.     Samsung rejected that at the time of the

4      negotiations, and the rulings of this Court have borne out

5      Samsung's position.

6                   The other non-infringement and invalidity defenses

7      raised in the case also establish that Samsung did not have

8      the requisite knowledge that the alleged induced acts

9      constitute patent infringement is also a lack of evidence of

10      willful blindness which is a theory that ContentGuard did

11      not timely raise.

12                   But even if it was timely raised, Samsung did not

13      take any affirmative acts to avoid learning of any

14      infringement.       To the contrary, Samsung investigated and

15      told ContentGuard that Samsung did not infringe and told

16      ContentGuard exactly why.

17                   Regarding contributory infringement, again,

18      Samsung is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that

19      there has been no contributory infringement.                 For the

20      reasons noted with respect to inducement, ContentGuard has

21      not provided sufficient or any evidence that Samsung knew or

22      should have known that use of the devices would constitute

23      infringement.

24                   There's been no evidence that Samsung's devices

25      have no substantial non-infringing uses.                The phones and the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 19 of 57 PageID #: 60471 19



1      tablets are staple articles.            They may be used for many

2      other substantial non-infringing uses, including texting,

3      calling, WiFi, camera, games, all those other uses.

4                   The accused Google apps also have substantial

5      non-infringing uses, such as displaying or playing

6      non-DRM-protected content.           There's no evidence in the

7      record that the apps are made or especially adapted for use

8      in any infringement.

9                   And that's the infringement, Your Honor.

10                   THE COURT:      All right.      The Court will note that

11      Samsung joins in and adopts the arguments of Google with

12      regard to infringement, in addition to what they've

13      specifically offered in the record.

14                   MR. SIROTA:       Thank you, Your Honor.

15                   MR. COTE:      Your Honor, ContentGuard would like to

16      continue its 50(a) motion on infringement.                We thought we

17      were just doing the Stefik patents, so we have the

18      meta-rights patents.

19                   THE COURT:      I'll hear the remainder of the

20      Plaintiff's motion under 50(a) regarding infringement.

21                   MR. HASENOUR:       Your Honor, Seth Hasenour.

22                   With respect to indirect infringement,

23      ContentGuard moves for judgment as a matter of law of

24      indirect infringement by both Google and Samsung both for

25      inducement and contributory infringement.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 20 of 57 PageID #: 60472 20



1                   There was substantial evidence of testing by both

2      Google and Samsung that they test the accused products and

3      applications to ensure that they operate properly.

4                   There is evidence of knowledge that the patent and

5      the infringement issues, and there's additional evidence

6      that the -- Samsung and Google promote and encourage use of

7      the accused products in the content both through testing and

8      instructing end users how to use that content in that

9      infringing manner.

10                   There's additional direct -- evidence of direct

11      infringement through the surveys that were presented at

12      trial, evidence of direct infringement through the sale of

13      the accused products, and the sale of content using the DRM

14      protection.

15                   There's additional testimony by Google that the

16      applications are used and that users download content and

17      use that content using these apps.

18                   There's additional circumstantial evidence by

19      which direct infringement can be inferred.

20                   And with respect to contributory infringement,

21      there's no substantial non-infringing use for the DRM

22      functionality of the accused products.

23                   Therefore, no reasonable juror could find that

24      there was not evidence and proof of indirect infringement

25      under both inducement and contributory infringement.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 21 of 57 PageID #: 60473 21



1                   And I believe the meta-rights -- briefly.

2                   MR. DEHONEY:       Yes, Your Honor.        David Dehoney for

3      Plaintiff ContentGuard.

4                   If I could just add with respect to the

5      meta-rights patent, the '053 patent, Mr. Hasenour already --

6      already addressed the evidence that Dr. Martin put on and

7      the reasons why all of the elements of the meta-rights

8      patents were present.

9                   But in addition, I would just add that the other

10      elements that are specific to the meta-rights patent,

11      including the state variable identifying a location, Google

12      never denied and never put in any evidence that would call

13      into question whether that element is present in the accused

14      Google system.

15                   THE COURT:      All right.      Thank you.

16                   Well, with regard to the motions under Rule 50(a)

17      by both Plaintiff and Defendant with regard to all the

18      various forms and theories of infringement, save the issue

19      of willfulness, which I've not heard on yet, the Court

20      denies Plaintiff's motion.           The Court denies Defendants'

21      motion.

22                   I'll hear arguments from both parties in regard to

23      any motions for judgment as a matter of law with regard to

24      the issue of validity.

25                   MR. HANSON:       Eric Hanson for Plaintiff,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 22 of 57 PageID #: 60474 22



1      ContentGuard.

2                   I'll be addressing the Stefik patent validity.

3      Plaintiff moves for judgment as a matter of law that

4      Defendants have not presented evidence or arguments

5      sufficient for a reasonable jury to find invalidity on the

6      basis of their '072 written description challenge.

7                   Defendants failed to provide evidence or testimony

8      of any sort regarding the written description defense for

9      the '072 patent, which related to whether or not the patent

10      specification disclosed written description support for

11      separately stored rights and content.

12                   Defendants, likewise, put on no evidence or

13      argument relating to their double patenting challenge to the

14      '859.    I believe that might be raised on -- as part of a

15      separate trial, but we want to move for judgment as a matter

16      of law to the extent that that's not the Court's plan.

17                   THE COURT:      Speak up a little bit, please.

18                   MR. HANSON:       Sorry.    I can't tell how loud the

19      microphone is.

20                   THE COURT:      I'll let you know if I can't hear you.

21                   MR. HANSON:       Okay.    Thank you.

22                   Plaintiff would also move for judgment as a matter

23      of law with regards to anticipation.               Defendants presented

24      an anticipation theory only as to the Orange Book for the

25      '859, '072, '007, and '956 patents.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 23 of 57 PageID #: 60475 23



1                   As part of their challenge, Defendants failed to

2      provide an element-by-element analysis of the Orange Book or

3      any other reference for that matter.

4                   The one reference -- the one element the

5      Defendants attempted to address in detail was the issue of

6      whether or not an Orange -- the Orange Book taught a digital

7      certificate for the purposes of establishing behavioral

8      integrity.

9                   And Mr. Ward relied on inherency for his digital

10      certificate argument, but he -- he failed to establish

11      inherency because he failed to show that digital certificate

12      was necessarily present in the Orange Book reference, which

13      is the standard for inherency.             It's not enough to simply

14      say that one of ordinary skill in the art might use a

15      certificate in that situation.

16                   Additionally -- excuse me -- Defendants failed to

17      show that -- to show the three integrities; that is,

18      behavioral integrity, communications integrity, and physical

19      integrity in the Orange Book.            They failed to show where the

20      integrities were located or how they work.

21                   Defendants additionally failed to address the

22      specific limitations for each claim.               And for the '859,

23      Claim 1, Defendants failed to address rendering the server

24      mode of operation, the requester mode of operation, and

25      distributed repository.          At least those are the ones that I
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 24 of 57 PageID #: 60476 24



1      found.

2                   With respect to the '072, Claim 1, Defendants

3      failed to address at least rendering, retrieving a digital

4      document and usage right from a document repository, storing

5      a digital document and at least one usage right in separate

6      files.

7                   For the '956, Mr. Ward failed to address at least

8      the processor, memory, receipt of digital content by a

9      repository, and determined to be trusted limitations.

10                   With respect to the '007 patent -- excuse me --

11      with respect to the '956 patent, I believe that was Claim 7,

12      and with respect to the '007 patent for Claim 6, Mr. Ward

13      failed to address the processor, at least the processor

14      memory, determining if a recipient competing device is

15      trusted and sending digital content and usage rights to a

16      recipient computing device limitations.

17                   Moving on to 103.         Defendants only sought to

18      address the -- the digital signature infirmity of the Orange

19      Book and their obviousness combinations involving the Orange

20      Book.

21                   As noted previously, Mr. Ward's testimony

22      regarding the Orange Book has other holes, and so Mr. Ward's

23      testimony failed to address all elements with regards to

24      obviousness, as well as to anticipation for any

25      Orange-Book-based challenge.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 25 of 57 PageID #: 60477 25



1                   Mr. Ward's testimony provided no motivation to

2      combine the references that he combined.                Mr. Ward's

3      testimony failed to follow the Court's claim construction

4      requiring a digital certificate to be a signed digital

5      message attesting to the identity of the possessor.

6                   I didn't hear him say anything about the digital

7      signatures that he referred to attesting to the identity of

8      the possessor.

9                   The remaining combination, Griswold fails to teach

10      usage rights that are attached or treated as attached to the

11      content.     The -- the license in Griswold never leaves the

12      license server and is never enforced by the client.

13      Defendants failed to show where Griswold teaches any of the

14      three integrities, again, that's behavioral, communications,

15      and physical, and Defendants failed to present any evidence

16      or testimony on -- on the combination of Kahn, Kahn and

17      Cerf, and CNI.

18                   So it's a combination that they disclosed before

19      trial and then didn't pursue.            We'd like a judgment as a

20      matter of law that they failed to establish obviousness over

21      that combination.

22                   Additionally, we believe that the secondary

23      considerations presented to the jury are sufficient to

24      preclude a finding of invalidity on obviousness.                  Kahn --

25      Dr. Kahn and Dr. -- Dr. Kahn and Dr. Cerf testified that
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 26 of 57 PageID #: 60478 26



1      they did not believe the patents were invalid.

2                   There was overwhelming evidence from Dr. Goodrich

3      and Dr. Martin that the patents were not invalid, and the --

4      the Court heard and the jury heard numerous accolades from

5      third parties regarding the importance and novelty of

6      Dr. Stefik's inventions.

7                   And that's all for Stefik.            I don't know if we

8      have additional for meta-rights.             Oh, we do.

9                   THE COURT:      Let me hear that.

10                   MR. HANSON:       Thank you.

11                   THE COURT:      Let's try to pick up the pace,

12      Counsel.     It'll soon be 7:00 o'clock.

13                   MR. DEHONEY:       David Dehoney again from

14      ContentGuard, Your Honor.

15                   For the meta-rights patent, the '053 patent,

16      Plaintiff moves for judgment as a matter of law on

17      anticipation.

18                   First, the only evidence Google offered in support

19      of their meta-rights invalidity challenge was based on the

20      Stefik '980 patent.         They provided no evidence regarding the

21      Ginter reference, the England reference, the Ireton

22      reference, and the Gruse reference that they had listed or

23      identified to us before trial.

24                   And even with respect to the Stefik '980 patent,

25      Defendants, or Google, in particular, did not provide any
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 27 of 57 PageID #: 60479 27



1      evidence that the Stefik '980 patent contains a state

2      variable that identifies a location.

3                   The -- the '280 patent, which we've also talked

4      about, just claims the state variable generally.                  The '053

5      patent requires a state variable that identifies a location.

6      And they did not -- Google did not even ask their expert

7      where the state variable that identifies a location is found

8      in the Stefik '980 patent.

9                   And so we do not believe that any reasonable jury

10      could conclude that a state variable identifying a location

11      is found in the -- the prior art that was presented to the

12      jury and so request judgment as a matter of law.

13                   THE COURT:      All right.      Let me hear a response and

14      any argument for Defendants with regard to the validity

15      issue concerning any motion they might offer.

16                   MS. WILLIAMS:       Your Honor, Google offers a

17      response and also seeks its own judgment as a matter of law

18      on invalidity issues.

19                   THE COURT:      I anticipated that.         Proceed.

20                   MS. WILLIAMS:       The evidence presented can -- the

21      evidence on the asserted prior art presented by Google would

22      compel a reasonable jury to find that the asserted Stefik

23      patent claims are invalid.           In particular, that prior art is

24      the DOD Orange Book which anticipates the asserted Stefik

25      patent claims.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 28 of 57 PageID #: 60480 28



1                   In addition, the following prior art combinations

2      were shown to render the asserted Stefik patent claims

3      obvious.

4                   No. 1.     The DOD Orange Book plus Harn.

5                   No. 2.     The DOD Orange Book plus the CNI

6      proceedings book.

7                   No. 3.     Kahn and Cerf, plus the CNI proceedings

8      book.

9                   No. 4.     Kahn and Cerf, plus the DOD Orange Book.

10                   And No. 5, the Griswold PCT application, plus the

11      CNI proceedings book.

12                   This evidence presented compels a conclusion that

13      these references disclose each element of the asserted

14      claims and not one of skill in the art would have been

15      motivated to combine them.

16                   The asserted prior art also supports the

17      conclusion that the asserted meta-right is invalid.                   The

18      evidence presented shows that this passage is anticipated

19      by, No. 1, the Stefik '980 patent; and, No. 2, Ginter, as

20      each of these references discloses every element of the

21      claim.

22                   The evidence produced at trial further compels the

23      conclusion that the meta-rights patent claim is obvious in

24      light of the combinations of the Stefik '980 patent, with

25      Ginter, England, the Ireton published application, or Gruse.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 29 of 57 PageID #: 60481 29



1                   In addition, Google moves for judgment as a matter

2      of law that the asserted patent claims are drawn to

3      unpatentable subject matter under Section 101.                  We believe

4      this is an issue of law that has been decided by the Court

5      and not a jury issue.

6                   However, in order to preserve the record on this

7      issue, to the extent any factual evidence could be deemed

8      relevant, we submit that the evidence presented at trial

9      compels the conclusion that the asserted patent claims are

10      drawn to abstract ideas, as they simply claim generic

11      computer systems using the well-known concepts of physical,

12      communications, and behavioral integrity.

13                   The evidence at trial has shown that there were no

14      inventive concepts in these patents, but rather merely the

15      use of methods and technology already well known in the

16      prior art and in the industry using standard computer

17      functions on generic computers.

18                   And that's all Google has, Your Honor.

19                   THE COURT:      All right.      Go ahead, Mr. Sirota.

20                   MR. SIROTA:       For Samsung, we have nothing in

21      addition on invalidity, but with Your Honor's permission, we

22      would join in Google's Rule 50(a) motion --

23                   THE COURT:      So noted.

24                   MR. SIROTA:       -- and response as well.

25                   Thank you, Your Honor.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 30 of 57 PageID #: 60482 30



1                   THE COURT:      All right.      With regard to the

2      arguments just presented regarding the overall topic of

3      invalidity as asserted by the Defendants, the Court denies

4      the Plaintiff's motion under Rule 50(a) regarding judgment

5      as a matter of law concerning validity.

6                   And the Court likewise denies the Defendants'

7      motion under Rule 50(a) regarding judgment as a matter of

8      law concerning validity.

9                   Does Plaintiff have additional motions under

10      Rule 50(a)?

11                   MR. YIM:      Yes, Your Honor, damages.

12                   THE COURT:      Please proceed.

13                   MR. YIM:      Thank you, Your Honor.         Jonathan Yim for

14      ContentGuard.

15                   ContentGuard moves for judgment as a matter of law

16      on damages.      Plaintiff, ContentGuard, has proved as a matter

17      of law by overwhelming evidence; that is, our damages for --

18      for Samsung and Google's infringement of the

19      patents-in-suit.

20                   Professor Teece testified that he calculated a

21      reasonable royalty under Georgia-Pacific, and the starting

22      point was the economic benefit Defendants have realized from

23      ContentGuard's inventions.

24                   Professor Teece was the only expert to put forth

25      evidence of the incremental benefit of the patented
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 31 of 57 PageID #: 60483 31



1      technology over the next best commercially acceptable

2      non-infringing alternative.

3                   His analysis of this benefit began with Professor

4      Prince's conjoint surveys that he designed to determine the

5      consumer willingness to pay for the ability to view

6      DRM-protected content on accused devices.

7                   Professor Prince testified that those survey

8      estimates were then further adjusted to reflect the

9      proportion of DRM-protected revenue transacted on Google

10      Play.

11                   Professor Prince also testified that he

12      concertedly selected the demographic profile of marginal

13      consumers based on those consumer who would have, on

14      average, the lowest willingness to pay.

15                   Professor Teece testified that he made further

16      adjustments to Professor Prince's findings to ensure that

17      the valuation of ContentGuard's invention is appropriate and

18      conservative.

19                   Professor Teece testified that he discounted the

20      willingness-to-pay figures to the percentage of consumers

21      who actually use the accused devices to view DRM-protected

22      videos and books as analyzed by Professor Prince in another

23      survey.

24                   He testified about the other adjustment which was

25      based on a benchmark analysis and opinions supplied by
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 32 of 57 PageID #: 60484 32



1      Professor Danaher.         And that was aimed at identifying value

2      of ContentGuard's DRM technology over other solutions.

3                   Professor Danaher testified that he analyzed the

4      effects of allowing secondary markets to emerge for the

5      digital content at issue in this case and determined that

6      they would cause a 58 percent decline in primary market

7      sales.

8                   Professor Teece testified that he then performed a

9      demand curve analysis to assess the price that Defendants

10      would charge for the devices in a but-for world wherein they

11      could not use ContentGuard's invention.                Professor Teece

12      testified that he used that analysis to identify the minimum

13      amount of profit Defendants would stand to gain from a

14      license.

15                   Under Georgia-Pacific Factor 15, Professor Teece

16      testified that he then constructed a hypothetical

17      negotiation to calculate its outcome.               He constructed a

18      bargaining range.        In order to assess where within that

19      bargaining range the parties would likely have ended up, he

20      testified concerning four factors.

21                   One of those factors involved the degree of risk

22      aversion of patience.          Professor Teece then testified that

23      he adopted a framework developed by Professor Rubinstein to

24      determine patience from discount factors, and he identified

25      the weighted average cost of capital as the most appropriate
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 33 of 57 PageID #: 60485 33



1      discount factor to apply in the hypothetical negotiation.

2                   Professor Teece testified that the outcome of a

3      hypothetical negotiation determines the device royalty

4      apportioned for infringement of the patents-in-suit, which

5      is $2.64 for Samsung and $2.49 for Google, per unit.

6                   For Google, Professor Teece testified that he also

7      calculated a royalty for each infringing transaction

8      involving DRM-protected digital books and video.                  Without

9      ContentGuard's patent says, the rental business for video

10      would have been possible on Google Play.

11                   Professor Danaher also testified that he

12      calculated Google's profits from video rental, and Professor

13      Teece from that, determined a royalty rate of 8 cents per

14      video rental transaction.

15                   Regarding Samsung's pre-suit damages, James Baker

16      testified that ContentGuard provided written notice of the

17      patents in this litigation to Samsung for several related

18      products for infringing ContentGuard's patents in this

19      matter at least as early as May 2009.

20                   James Baker further testified that every product

21      analyzed in discussion with Samsung was presented as an

22      exemplar of how Samsung's use of the -- of the Stefik

23      patents were infringed -- were infringements.

24                   James Baker further testified that ContentGuard

25      specifically identified Google Play in a presentation to
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 34 of 57 PageID #: 60486 34



1      Samsung.     The presentation was introduced as PX-503.21.

2      That lists Google Play Movies as using Widevine.

3                   James Baker also testified that ContentGuard

4      delivered claim charts for the '859, '956, and '072 patents

5      to Samsung, mapping claims to Samsung -- Samsung Android

6      smartphones for use of DRM and Google Play, in particular.

7                   Mr. Kwak's testimony corroborated that of James

8      Baker, acknowledging years of meetings between ContentGuard

9      and Samsung and receipt of claim charts, mapping of the

10      patents-in-suit to Samsung Android smartphones.

11                   Moreover, Mr. Kwak admitted that Samsung

12      understands how Widevine works.

13                   THE COURT:      Read a little faster, please, Counsel.

14                   MR. YIM:      Yes.    Yes, Your Honor.

15                   Regarding Google's pre-suit damages, Mr. Rosenberg

16      testified that Google learned about ContentGuard's patents

17      in this matter and their use by Google Play in 2012 when

18      they were contacted by their manufacturing partners whom

19      Google had con -- I'm sorry -- whom ContentGuard had

20      contacted.

21                   Further, James Baker testified that ContentGuard

22      was in ongoing discussions with Motorola dating back to 2006

23      and that it was ContentGuard's understanding that their

24      communications were being relayed by Motorola to their

25      parent company Google as of Google's acquisition of
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 35 of 57 PageID #: 60487 35



1      Motorola.

2                   For all these -- all the foregoing reasons,

3      ContentGuard is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on

4      damages.

5                   THE COURT:      Thank you.

6                   Let me hear a response from Defendants and any

7      motion on damages they might care to offer under Rule 50(a),

8      as well.

9                   MS. WILLIAMS:       Yes, Your Honor.        Once again, we

10      respond and offer a motion.

11                   Google requests judgment as a matter of law on

12      damages.     ContentGuard's damages evidence was unreliable,

13      not appropriately tied to the facts of this case and cannot

14      be relied upon by a reasonable jury to make a damages award.

15      Google thus requests that any award of damages be limited to

16      that supported by Google's expert, Dr. O'Brien.

17                   Google believes that the damages testimony of

18      Dr. Teece should have been excluded for the reasons

19      presented in the Daubert briefing.              The evidence at trial

20      shows that a reasonable jury could not rely on that evidence

21      to make a damages award.

22                   In particular, ContentGuard's damages evidence is

23      based on speculation.          Dr. Teece's reliance on Dr. Prince

24      and Dr. Danaher's opinions was unreasonable.

25                   Although the evidence showed several fatal flaws
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 36 of 57 PageID #: 60488 36



1      in Dr. Prince's surveys, a few examples were his failure to

2      measure the willingness of consumers to pay for the actual

3      accused apps at issue, instead of questioning participants

4      on the value of their ability to view any content and his

5      misleading definition of the well-known Google Play term to

6      purported -- to purportedly refer only to accused apps.

7                   Similarly, adoption of Dr. Danaher's reliance on

8      the sale of physical video game disks was unreasonable and

9      rendered Dr. Teece's opinion unreliable.                Dr. Danaher simply

10      adopted the conclusion of the completely non-analogous

11      Shiller video game study to measure the purported impact of

12      a resale market for the digital content used by the accused

13      apps, a market that he acknowledges does not exist.

14                   Dr. Teece's opinion is further fatally flawed by

15      his use of the Rubinstein bargaining model which evidence

16      showed that both Dr. Rubinstein and Dr. Teece considered to

17      be akin to a fairy tale.

18                   Despite this frequent use of unreliable

19      information, the only validation check Dr. Teece performed

20      for his proposed royalty rates was comparing them to

21      ContentGuard's previous settlement and license agreements,

22      agreements that took into consideration 700 plus patents,

23      not just the four Stefik patents-in-suit that were

24      considered in the hypothetical bargaining situation.

25                   And that also had a worldwide scope, not just the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 37 of 57 PageID #: 60489 37



1      limited national use that was considered in the hypothetical

2      bargaining situation.

3                   The evidence showed that Dr. Teece ignored actual

4      real-world facts that the bargaining parties would have

5      known at the time of the bargaining that would have affected

6      their positions.

7                   Indeed, Dr. Teece did not consider the fact that

8      only a few months after Q4 2010 when the hypothetical

9      bargain took place, that Pendrell purchased 90.1 percent of

10      ContentGuard for $90.1 million, which was three times less

11      than the amount of the hypothetical license's lump-sum

12      payment that are the result of Dr. Teece's calculation.

13                   Finally, the fact that 700 plus ContentGuard

14      patents were valued at 1.08 million in Pendrell's 2011

15      filing, a number that is three times less than the amount of

16      Dr. Teece's calculated royalty payment, also does not give

17      Dr. Teece any pause.

18                   The evidence compels the conclusion that

19      Dr. Teece's opinion is unreliable and cannot constitute

20      sufficient evidence to support ContentGuard's proposed

21      damages award.

22                   In addition, ContentGuard's damages evidence

23      violates the entire market value rule as it fails to

24      identify the smallest salable patent practicing unit.

25                   Dr. Teece's testimony confirms that instead of
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 38 of 57 PageID #: 60490 38



1      identifying the smallest salable patent practicing unit to

2      determine a revenue base, he computed damages based on his

3      demand curve profitability analysis of the smartphones and

4      tablets themselves.

5                   Indeed, Dr. Teece uses the Android device

6      Defendants' respective revenues of tens of millions and even

7      billions of dollars from sales of smartphones and tablets as

8      the foundation for his damages calculations.                 This use of

9      revenue from the entire product violates the entire market

10      value rule and its underlying evidentiary principle and

11      cannot support a jury verdict.

12                   Finally, Dr. Teece failed to offer evidence

13      apportioning the value of the patented components from the

14      unpatented features of the accused applications.

15                   The Federal Circuit has repeatedly held that in

16      any case involving multi-component products, patentees may

17      not calculate damages based on sales of the entire product,

18      as opposed to the smallest salable patent practicing unit

19      without showing that the demand for the entire product is

20      attributable to the patented feature.

21                   Dr. Teece assumed that Android smartphones and

22      tablets infringe the patents-in-suit where the two accused

23      apps, Google Play Books and Google Play Movies & TV, are

24      installed on that device.

25                   The evidence at trial showed that the accused apps
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 39 of 57 PageID #: 60491 39



1      do not drive consumer demand for smartphones and tablets,

2      and, therefore, in order to calculate a reasonable royalty

3      for the accused apps, which are a small part of smartphones

4      and tablets, apportionment is required which Dr. Teece did

5      not properly include in his calculation.

6                   He also failed to apportion the value of features

7      of Google's products and services not covered by the

8      asserted patent claims.

9                   Your Honor, we also have a few other

10      damages-related motions that we'd like to bring at this

11      time.

12                   THE COURT:      All right.      Proceed, Ms. Williams.

13                   MS. WILLIAMS:       First, no pre-suit damages.            Google

14      also requests judgment as a matter of law of no pre-suit

15      damages for the '859, '956, '007, and '053 patents.

16                   The Court's summary judgment order held that

17      ContentGuard failed to mark and to cause its licensees to

18      mark products with the patent numbers as required by the

19      patent marking statute and limited ContentGuard's pre-suit

20      damages to the period after Google received actual notice.

21                   Actual notice requires that the patentee

22      affirmatively communicate to the alleged infringer a

23      specific charge of infringement by a specific accused

24      product or device.         It does not matter whether a defendant

25      knew of the patent or knew of his own infringement because
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 40 of 57 PageID #: 60492 40



1      the notice inquiry focuses on the patentee's action, not the

2      defendants' knowledge or understanding.

3                   The testimony of ContentGuard's representative,

4      James Baker, was unequivocal that there were no

5      communications at all between and ContentGuard and Google

6      prior to this lawsuit.          ContentGuard's witness's speculation

7      that Google may have indirectly learned of some patents or

8      products through other means is simply legally insufficient,

9      in addition to being based on impermissible speculation.

10                   Second, Google also requests judgment as a matter

11      of law that ContentGuard cannot recover damages for any

12      content provided from Time Warner or Sony as the undisputed

13      evidence shows that this content was licensed and thus

14      cannot be infringing.

15                   Third, Google seeks -- seeks judgment as a matter

16      of law on non-infringing alternatives.               ContentGuard failed

17      to submit evidence from which a reasonable jury could find

18      that Google could not have implemented Microsoft PlayReady

19      as a non-infringing alternative.

20                   ContentGuard presented no evidence at trial that

21      PlayReady was not commercially viable.               To the contrary, the

22      undisputed evidence presented at trial was that PlayReady

23      could be implemented in only a few months time for less than

24      $750,000.      Damages against Google must thus be capped at the

25      rate Google would be charged by Microsoft for PlayReady.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 41 of 57 PageID #: 60493 41



1                   And, Your Honor, I believe those are all the

2      damages-related motions that Google has.

3                   THE COURT:      Let me hear from Samsung with regard

4      to damages.

5                   MR. JONES:      Your Honor, excuse me.          Samsung would

6      request permission to refer by reference to the damages

7      Rule 50(a) motions, as well as the other motions that have

8      been made by Google and join in them and present our motion

9      by way of supplement on them.

10                   THE COURT:      The Court will recognize the joinder

11      of Samsung in the motions under Rule 50(a) regarding the

12      category of damages by Samsung.

13                   MR. JONES:      Thank you, Your Honor.

14                   And then it's by way of supplement only, Samsung

15      would state that it moves under Rule 50(a) for a motion for

16      judgment as a matter of law that the Plaintiff's damages

17      model is improper because we have a ResQNet situation where

18      they ignored the real relevant evidence in this case which

19      were the pre-date hypothetical negotiation licenses in their

20      damage model.

21                   Secondly, we would move because their analysis

22      looked far beyond the footprint of the invention.                   She

23      already made the motion that they -- they -- they failed to

24      apportion.

25                   We would also supplement that by saying in the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 42 of 57 PageID #: 60494 42



1      alternative, they have failed to apportion properly to DRM

2      technology.      Instead, they looked at the failure to watch

3      video or to read books on Google Movies & TV and Google's

4      Books which includes much more technology, such as

5      compression technology and display technology.

6                   Next, we would move for the reason that the

7      PlayReady license established that there was a marketplace

8      with regard to DRM technology and they totally ignored that.

9                   Next, we would move because of their reliance on

10      Amazon, which was admitted over our objection, but we would

11      note that they relied upon it as a check without any attempt

12      to separate out of the portfolio license a value for the

13      patents-in-suit or to separate a value out for what was not

14      in suit in this case and then show the jury that here we've

15      got a rate of 2.63 to 2.64, and that was an improper model.

16                   We further move and object to the damages evidence

17      on the basis that they used an improper model which

18      constitutes double recovery when they are recovering

19      royalties on both device sales and content.

20                   We move for the further reason that their damages

21      model seeks to punish.

22                   We move for the further reason that their damages

23      model used a litigation multiplier effectively.

24                   We move as a matter of law that we have proven

25      that content recovery would have been appropriate and there
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 43 of 57 PageID #: 60495 43



1      is no recovery based upon device sales.

2                   We move that the damages model is incorrect as a

3      matter of law because of Prince's survey, but as a

4      supplement to that, we would also move to strike the Prince

5      survey at this time because we think it's been established

6      as a matter of law by the testimony of Dr. Reibstein that

7      what was looked at was a Google Play suite, not these two

8      applications, and that that has been established by the

9      overwhelming preponderance of uncontradicted evidence.

10                   THE COURT:      Mr. Jones, how do you expect me to

11      strike something at this point when the evidence is in and

12      the jury has gone home and they're not going to hear

13      anything other than final instructions and closing argument?

14                   MR. JONES:      I understand.

15                   THE COURT:      Your motion to strike is untimely and

16      is denied.

17                   MR. JONES:      Thank you, Your Honor.

18                   And then finally we would move, based upon Integra

19      versus Merck, that the model is invalid as a matter of law

20      in light of the fact that it's three times what the company

21      so far at a time -- close in time to the date of

22      hypothetical negotiation.

23                   Thank you, Your Honor.

24                   THE COURT:      All right.      Mr. Malecek?

25                   MR. MALECEK:       Yes, Your Honor.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 44 of 57 PageID #: 60496 44



1                   I apologize for jumping up, but to the extent that

2      any of those motions on behalf of Samsung were not covered

3      by our Google recitation, we'd ask to join in those motions.

4                   THE COURT:      Duly noted.       The Google arguments are

5      joined in by Samsung, and the Samsung arguments are joined

6      in by Google.

7                   And those arguments are denied, as are the

8      Plaintiff's.

9                   Are there additional motions under Rule 50(a)?

10                   MR. JONES:      With regard to marking, Your Honor.

11                   THE COURT:      And I know it's important, Counsel,

12      for you to cover the record thoroughly, but anything you can

13      do to speed this process up would be appreciated by the

14      Court.

15                   MR. JONES:      I will, Your Honor.

16                   With regard to marking with regard to the '956

17      patent, the Court has already ruled with regard to

18      constructive notice and actual notice as required.

19                   With regard to the '956 patent, Claim 7, we

20      believe as a matter of law that actual notice was given on

21      February the 12th, 2013, a week after the patent issued.

22      And that was the only time that notice was given with --

23      with regard to the accused products in question in this case

24      and would move for judgment as a matter of law with regard

25      to that notice.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 45 of 57 PageID #: 60497 45



1                   With regard to the '859 patent, Claim 1, the

2      damage -- no -- no effective notice was ever given, again,

3      with regard to the claims asserted in this suit and that the

4      effective damages period with regard to that claim of that

5      patent would begin on January the 17th, 2014, Your Honor.

6                   THE COURT:      All right.      Yes, Ms. Williams?

7                   MS. WILLIAMS:       Your Honor, we just have one final

8      motion for no willful infringement.

9                   THE COURT:      All right.      I assume the Plaintiffs

10      have a motion to find as a matter of law that the

11      infringement that you've asked for is willful?

12                   MR. COTE:      Yes, Your Honor.

13                   THE COURT:      Let's follow the same order.            Let me

14      hear from Plaintiff first and then Defendant.

15                   Are you going to present the motion, Mr. Cote?

16                   MR. COTE:      I'll start with Samsung.

17                   As early as 2006, ContentGuard informed Samsung

18      that it held fundamental technology, Stefik technology to a

19      trusted repository that was foundational to DRM systems.

20                   Beginning in 2009, ContentGuard provided notice

21      letters, notice of infringement to Samsung followed by

22      numerous claim charts that applied the Stefik patents and

23      other ContentGuard patents, including the patents-in-suit to

24      Samsung products.

25                   As evidenced by the testimony of James Baker,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 46 of 57 PageID #: 60498 46



1      Mr. Kwon, James Kwak, ContentGuard engaged in years of

2      technical and business discussions with Samsung regarding

3      its patents, including the patents in this litigation and

4      the applicability of those patents to Samsung's products.

5                   In 2012, ContentGuard specifically informed

6      Samsung that implementation of Google Play Movies & TV and

7      Google Play Books also constituted infringement of the

8      patents in this litigation.

9                   After learning of the patents, Samsung took -- the

10      evidence shows Samsung took no -- no steps to avoid

11      infringing or to design around the asserted patents.                    It did

12      not request that ContentGuard speak with Google about

13      ContentGuard's infringement.

14                   Claims relating to the Google apps on Samsung

15      devices.     Samsung continued, despite knowledge of our

16      patents and our claims, to pre-install Google Play apps on

17      each and every one of the devices at issue in this case,

18      roughly 120 million devices, all the while, as the testimony

19      of Mr. Kwak demonstrated, for example, Samsung was aware of

20      how Widevine DRM -- the accused DRM functionality and the

21      Google Play apps worked.           They were aware because they were

22      licensed to use the Widevine DRM system for years.

23                   Mr. Kwak also testified that they -- the technical

24      team within Samsung understood how Widevine DRM worked, and

25      they held in their possession documentation that would

1      demonstrate that the single issue that we heard in opening

2      and the single issue we heard from Samsung throughout this

3      case, including from Mr. Kwak, was false, that in fact, the

4      rights -- the usage rights and the content are attached.

5                   We saw one example of that.            The theory of

6      operation for the Widevine DRM system that I put before

7      Mr. Kwak was also presented with Mr. Baker, Brian Baker, the

8      CEO of Widevine.        And it demonstrates, by their own

9      documents, that they were well aware that the usage rights

10      and the content are tied and bound to each other.

11                   Throughout this entire period, they were also

12      aware that ContentGuard's DRM technology was widely known to

13      be foundational to modern DRM systems and that Mr. Stefik

14      was widely known as the father of DRM.

15                   As a result of everything I've just said, they

16      proceeded with an objectively high risk that they would be

17      found to infringe, and that risk was either known or so

18      obvious that it should have been known to Samsung.

19                   Samsung's willfulness has therefore been

20      established as a matter of law, and no reasonable jury could

21      find otherwise.

22                   THE COURT:      Let me hear your argument with regard

23      to Google.

24                   MR. COTE:      Okay.    Google became aware of the

25      patents-in-suit as well, at least as early as May of 2012,
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 48 of 57 PageID #: 60500 48



1      as the evidence during trial shows.

2                   Mr. Baker testified that in numerous discussions

3      with Android device manufacturers regarding their use of

4      Google Play Books and Google Play Movies & TV applications,

5      that those OEM manufacturers -- device manufacturers had

6      been in communications with Google regarding ContentGuard's

7      patents and its infringement claims regarding the patents

8      that are in this litigation.

9                   Also, as established by Mr. Baker, ContentGuard

10      had numerous conversations with Motorola which until more

11      recently was a subsidiary of Google and that through those

12      conversations with Motorola, he was informed that Google was

13      aware of the infringement claims regarding the patents in

14      this matter against Motorola for Motorola's use of the

15      Google Play apps for both books, movies, and TV.

16                   And as we heard from Mr. Jamie Rosenberg, Google's

17      representative -- corporate representative in this matter,

18      he admitted that Google did, in fact, receive such notice.

19      It was not just from the testimony of Mr. James Baker, but

20      it came as well from Mr. Jamie Rosenberg that Google was

21      aware at least as early as 2012 about our patents and about

22      our claims.

23                   After learning of the patents-in-suit in 2012, the

24      testimony shows that Google took no steps to avoid

25      infringement or to design around the asserted patents.                    They
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 49 of 57 PageID #: 60501 49



1      did not contact -- contact ContentGuard to investigate

2      ContentGuard's claims, despite its knowledge of our patents

3      and our claims.        They made no effort to discuss those

4      infringement claims with ContentGuard.

5                   In fact, after learning of the patents-in-suit,

6      Google continued to require all its device manufacturers to

7      pre-install each device with Google Play apps, both Books,

8      Movies, and TV.

9                   They did so continuing until this lawsuit was

10      filed.     They did so while this lawsuit was filed.                And they

11      continue today to mandate that those infringing applications

12      remain on Android devices if a manufacturer wishes to sell

13      an Android device.

14                   As we learned from Mr. Brian Baker's testimony,

15      who is the Widevine CEO, Google understood, because it owns

16      Widevine, how their Google Play apps work, how specifically

17      the DRM works, and they understood that the usage rights and

18      content are actually bound and tied together through unique

19      asset ID.      That became clear during the trial of this

20      matter.

21                   Google also knew, as the exemplary documentation

22      we put before Mr. Baker demonstrated, Mr. Brian Baker,

23      again, the CEO of Widevine -- they also knew that the

24      device -- the DRM they were selling constituted a trusted

25      repository and that it practiced each and every one of the
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 50 of 57 PageID #: 60502 50



1      integrities, as required by the Court's claim construction.

2                   And, again, it was widely known throughout this

3      period of time, from 2012 forward, by the marketplace,

4      including Google, that ContentGuard's patents were

5      foundational to today's DRM systems and that Dr. Stefik was

6      widely known as the father of DRM.

7                   On that basis, they proceeded with an objectively

8      high risk that -- that they would be found to infringe and

9      that risk was either known or so obvious that it should have

10      been known to Google.

11                   Google's willfulness has been established as a

12      matter of law, and no reasonable jury could find otherwise.

13                   Thank you.

14                   THE COURT:      Let me hear a response and any counter

15      motion that Google cares to offer.

16                   MR. MALECEK:       Mike Malecek on behalf of Google,

17      Your Honor.      Google moves for judgment as a matter of law of

18      no willful infringement.           ContentGuard has not met its

19      burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that

20      Google --

21                   THE COURT:      Slow down, Mr. Malecek.          I still have

22      a court reporter that has to survive your rapid speech.

23                   MR. MALECEK:       Sorry, Madam Court Reporter.            I

24      erred in the other direction.

25                   THE COURT:        Go ahead.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 51 of 57 PageID #: 60503 51



1                   MR. MALECEK:       ContentGuard has not met its burden

2      of proving by clear and convincing evidence that Google

3      acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its

4      actions constituted infringement of a valid patent.

5                   Google has raised several reasonable defenses,

6      including its non-infringement arguments, anticipation,

7      obviousness, and written description defenses, its

8      unpatentable subject matter challenge under Section 101 and

9      its equitable defenses.

10                   Google, therefore, requests the Court find the

11      first prong of willfulness test cannot be met and not

12      present the issue of willfulness to the jury.

13                   The evidence presented was also insufficient for

14      the jury to find by clear and convincing evidence that the

15      objectively defined risk was either known or so obvious that

16      it should have been known to Google.

17                   And for those reasons, we seek JMOL on that.

18                   THE COURT:      All right.      Samsung, on the issue of

19      willfulness.

20                   MR. SIROTA:       Thank you, Your Honor.

21                   Samsung also moves for judgment as a matter of law

22      of no willfulness.         The evidence cannot support a finding

23      that Samsung acted despite an objectively high likelihood

24      that its actions constituted infringement of a willful -- of

25      a valid patent.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 52 of 57 PageID #: 60504 52



1                   The Federal Circuit has determined that the first

2      prong of the willfulness test is an issue of law for the

3      Court and is not met when the infringer, whatever its state

4      of mind at the time of the infringement, presents in the

5      litigation a defense that is objectively reasonable.

6                   Samsung had pre-suit notice of -- of the patents.

7      Also allegations were made relating to Widevine, but the

8      evidence does not establish notice of the alleged

9      infringement of either the '859 or '072 patents by the

10      accused Google Play apps until after suit was filed.

11      Infringement of the '956 patent was not alleged until

12      February 2013.

13                   Samsung's trial defenses are objectively

14      reasonable, including non-infringement and invalidity.

15      Samsung also presented close issues of claim construction

16      earlier in the case that were object -- objectively

17      reasonable and would have provided additional

18      non-infringement defenses.

19                   Samsung also presented an objectively reasonable

20      Section 101 defense based on lack of patentable subject

21      matter.     Samsung, therefore, requests that the Court grant

22      judgment as a matter of law of no willfulness based on the

23      failure of ContentGuard to satisfy the objective prong with

24      clear and convincing evidence and that the Court not allow

25      the issue of willfulness to go to the jury.
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 53 of 57 PageID #: 60505 53



1                   There's also insufficient evidence to support a

2      finding of -- by clear and convincing evidence that assuming

3      there was an objectively defined risk, it was either known

4      or so obvious that it should have been known to Samsung.

5                   Samsung's pre-suit position of non-infringement,

6      as expressed to ContentGuard, was reasonable.                 ContentGuard

7      claimed it only had to demonstrate that usage rights are

8      associated with content.

9                   The position was rejected by Samsung at the time.

10      As both James Baker of ContentGuard and James Kwak of

11      Samsung testified, that's not disputed.                During claim

12      construction in this case, the Court also declined to adopt

13      the position that mere association is enough to establish

14      infringement.

15                   There's also insufficient -- I'm sorry -- the --

16      Samsung's objective belief of non-infringement is also fully

17      supported by the five to six years of ContentGuard telling

18      Samsung that the OMA ForwardLock infringed.

19                   It's supported by Samsung denying that allegation

20      because its implementation did not have usage rights and by

21      ContentGuard finally agreeing not to pursue that in its

22      case -- this case.

23                   When ContentGuard then alleged that Google Play

24      apps infringed six years into the negotiations, Samsung was

25      understandably dubious, particularly in view of
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 54 of 57 PageID #: 60506 54



1      ContentGuard's insistence that it only need to demonstrate

2      an association between the usage rights and content to

3      establish infringement.

4                   This was contrary to the patent specification

5      which teaches that a key feature of the present invention is

6      that usage rights are permanently attached to the digital

7      work.

8                   Again, the Court's claim construction supported

9      Samsung's position that association is not enough.                   Both

10      James Baker and Eddie Chen of ContentGuard acknowledged that

11      Samsung told ContentGuard that Samsung is not infringing the

12      patents.

13                   The evidence shows that Content -- ContentGuard's

14      response was that it simply would not discuss Samsung's

15      position with it anymore.

16                   We move for summary -- for judgment as a matter of

17      law, Your Honor.

18                   THE COURT:      All right.      With regard to the issue

19      of willfulness raised by the Plaintiff in their motion under

20      Rule 50(a) seeking judgment as a matter of law that the

21      conduct of Defendants is willful, the Court denies that

22      motion.

23                   With regard to the Defendants' motions under

24      Rule 50(a) that the Court find as a matter of law that their

25      conduct is not willful, the Court denies those motions as
Case 2:13-cv-01112-JRG Document 957 Filed 09/24/15 Page 55 of 57 PageID #: 60507 55



1      well.

2                   Are there other motions under Rule 50(a) to be

3      presented by the Plaintiff?

4                   MR. COTE:      No, Your Honor.

5                   THE COURT:      Are there other motions under

6      Rule 50(a) to be presented by either Defendant?

7                   MR. MALECEK:       Not under 50(a), Your Honor, but I

8      do have two housekeeping matters that I would like to take

9      up at the appropriate time.

10                   THE COURT:      Let me get an announcement from

11      Samsung.

12                   MR. SIROTA:       No further 50(a) motions, Your Honor.

13                   THE COURT:      All right.      That will complete

14      presentation of argument under Rule 50(a) for motions as --

15      for motions for judgment as a matter of law in advance of

16      any jury verdict to be returned.

17                   All right.      Mr. Malecek, two housekeeping matters

18      I believe you said.

19                   MR. MALECEK:       Yes, Your Honor.

20                   We do intend to make a motion for laches based on

21      the extensive record that we -- that they were aware of

22      Widevine and Google and didn't act on that.                 That's been

23      brought out at trial.

24                   We understand from the Court that that should be

25      brought up later.        You don't want to deal with that

1      motion --

2                   THE COURT:      I'll hear from that after we receive a

3      verdict --

4                   MR. MALECEK:       Okay.    Thank you.

5                   THE COURT:      -- assuming it's still relevant at

6      that time.

7                   MR. MALECEK:       Yes.    Thank you.

8                   The second most -- the second housekeeping matter,

9      Your Honor, is I wanted to put the Court on notice that we

10      most likely will be filing a motion tonight about seeking to

11      preclude Defendants to argue about certain --

12                   THE COURT:      To preclude Defendants from arguing?

13                   MR. MALECEK:       Excuse me.      Preclude -- I won't

14      comment on what I was thinking.             Preclude the Plaintiffs

15      from arguing certain issues that were outside the scope of

16      not only their expert reports but their infringement

17      contentions in this matter relating to some specific

18      evidence in the theory of operation and a technical aspect

19      of this called the ECM, which we'll describe in the motion.

20                   I let Mr. Thomas know that we would be filing it.

21      I didn't want to surprise the Court when it came in.

22                   THE COURT:      All right.      Well, file your motion.

23      There are just one or two little things that the Court has

24      on its agenda, but I'll take it up as -- as promptly as I

25      can.
