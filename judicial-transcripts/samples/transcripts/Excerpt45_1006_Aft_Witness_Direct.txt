12:53:06    1   safety without the T, and Kiaei rhymes with Hawaii.

12:53:07    2   Q.   And where do you work?

12:53:08    3   A.   I am a professor at Arizona State University in the

12:53:14    4   Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

12:53:16    5   Q.   And could you tell the jury why you are here today?

12:53:20    6   A.   Yes.    I am here to give my opinion about the Amazon

12:53:30    7   Echo devices that they do not infringe on the '049 patent.

12:53:33    8   Q.   And have you prepared slides to help us here in court?

12:53:38    9   A.   Yes, sir.    I have prepared a few slides to go through

12:53:42   10   my presentation.     So, if you don't mind, let's go to the

12:53:47   11   next one.
