# Tactical Paths: Plaintiff vs. Defendant in Witness Examination

| Stage | Plaintiff (Calling Witness) | Defendant (Opposing Party) |
|-------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Direct Examination** | • Tell a coherent story that advances burden of proof.<br>• Keep scope narrow to reduce exposure on cross.<br>• Avoid leading questions — rely on witness credibility.<br>• Decision: Broader narrative vs. laser-focused technical points. | • Listen for overreach or technical missteps.<br>• Note areas where direct “opened the door.”<br>• Prep for impeachment or credibility attacks. |
| **Cross-Examination** | • Brace witness for hostile leading questions.<br>• Decision: Pre-emptively cover weaknesses on direct, or risk them surfacing on cross.<br>• Plaintiff’s attorney may object (“beyond scope,” “compound,” etc.) to limit damage. | • Primary chance to undermine witness.<br>• Use short, leading questions to control testimony.<br>• Decision: Aggressive cross (risk jury backlash) vs. surgical cross (minimize redirect opportunities). |
| **Redirect Examination** | • Repair credibility and clarify damaging cross points.<br>• Keep tight to cross scope — avoid opening new issues.<br>• Decision: Sometimes better to skip redirect if cross was weak.<br>• Key in technical expert testimony where jurors may need clarity. | • Decide whether to challenge redirect.<br>• If redirect was minimal, may skip recross to avoid reinforcing credibility.<br>• Watch for subtle rehabilitation that may sway jury. |
| **Recross Examination** | • Plaintiff must defend against renewed attack if taken.<br>• Risks losing the benefit of redirect if recross lands effectively.<br>• Strategic decision: anticipate recross when deciding whether to redirect at all. | • Target only what was raised on redirect.<br>• Effective when plaintiff’s redirect seemed like “damage control.”<br>• Decision: If redirect was weak, recross may do more harm than good. |
| **Re-Redirect & Beyond (Rare)** | • Used sparingly in complex I.P. expert testimony (e.g., source code analysis, damages models).<br>• Risk: Jury fatigue and judicial impatience.<br>• Almost always signals high-stakes technical testimony. | • Judges rarely allow more than one recross.<br>• If granted, can be effective to prevent plaintiff from “getting the last word.” |

## Key Contrasts

- **Plaintiffs** are **risk managers**: They must balance telling a persuasive story against minimizing attack vectors. Every redirect decision risks giving the defense another bite.  
- **Defendants** are **opportunists**: Their strongest chance to weaken plaintiff’s case is on cross. They must decide how far to push without overplaying.
