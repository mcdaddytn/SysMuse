01:41:27    2           (Jury out.)

01:41:27    3           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

01:41:28    4           THE COURT:     Be seated, please.

01:42:06    5           All right.     Counsel, are there questions from

01:42:32    6   either Plaintiff or Defendant or anything that needs to be

01:42:33    7   raised with the Court before I bring in the jury and begin

01:42:36    8   with my preliminary instructions?

01:42:39    9           MS. TRUELOVE:      Nothing from Plaintiff, Your Honor.

01:42:41   10           MR. DACUS:     Nothing from Defendant, Your Honor.

01:42:42   11           THE COURT:     All right.     Then let's bring in the

01:42:45   12   jury, please.

01:42:51   13           COURT SECURITY OFFICER:        All rise.

01:42:53   14           (Jury in.)

01:43:15   15           THE COURT:     Please be seated.

01:43:17   16           Welcome back from lunch, ladies and gentlemen.

01:43:24   17           I have some preliminary instructions that I need

01:43:29   18   to give you at this time, and I'd like to give them to you

01:43:34   19   on the record before we start with opening statements from

01:43:40   20   the lawyers.

01:43:40   21           You've now been sworn as the jurors in this case.

01:43:43   22   And as the jury, you are the sole judges of the facts.             And

01:43:47   23   as such, you will determine what all the facts are in this

01:43:49   24   case.

01:43:49   25           As the Judge, I'll give you instructions on the
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 4 of 156 PageID #: 18465
                                                                                       129



01:43:52    1   law.     I will decide questions of law that arise during the

01:43:57    2   trial.     I'll handle all matters related to evidence and

01:44:00    3   procedure.     I'm responsible for overseeing the efficient

01:44:04    4   flow of the evidence in the trial and maintaining the

01:44:07    5   decorum of the courtroom.

01:44:08    6              At the end of the evidence, I'll give you detailed

01:44:14    7   instructions about the law to apply in deciding the case,

01:44:17    8   and I'll give you a list of questions that you are then to

01:44:20    9   answer.     This list of questions, as I may have mentioned,

01:44:24   10   is called the verdict form.

01:44:26   11              Your answers to those questions will need to be

01:44:28   12   unanimous, and those answers to those questions will

01:44:33   13   constitute the jury's verdict in this case.

01:44:34   14              Now, I want to briefly tell you what the case is

01:44:38   15   about.     As you know, this case involves a dispute regarding

01:44:42   16   one certain United States patent.        I know that each of you

01:44:46   17   saw the patent video film produced by the Federal Judicial

01:44:50   18   Center, but I need to give you some instructions now and on

01:44:52   19   the record about a patent and how one is obtained.

01:44:56   20              Patents are granted or denied by the United States

01:44:59   21   Patent and Trademark Office, sometimes, for short, simply

01:45:03   22   called the PTO.

01:45:06   23              A valid United States patent gives the holder of

01:45:10   24   that patent the right for up to 20 years from the date the

01:45:13   25   patent application is filed, to prevent others from making,
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 5 of 156 PageID #: 18466
                                                                                       130



01:45:18    1   using, offering to sell, or selling the patented invention

01:45:23    2   within the United States or from importing it into the

01:45:27    3   United States without the patentholder's permission.

01:45:31    4           A patent is a form of property called intellectual

01:45:36    5   property.    And like other forms of property, a patent can

01:45:39    6   be bought or sold.

01:45:41    7           A violation of the patentholder's rights is called

01:45:46    8   infringement.     A patentholder may try to enforce a patent

01:45:49    9   against persons it believes to be infringers by filing a

01:45:53   10   lawsuit in federal court.      And that's what we have before

01:45:56   11   us in this case.

01:45:56   12           The process of obtaining a patent is called patent

01:46:01   13   prosecution.     To obtain a patent, one must first file an

01:46:08   14   application with the PTO.      The PTO, the United States

01:46:12   15   Patent and Trademark Office, is an agency of the United

01:46:16   16   States Government that employs trained examiners who review

01:46:20   17   applications for patents.

01:46:21   18           The application includes what is called a

01:46:26   19   specification.     The specification contains a written

01:46:31   20   description of the claimed invention telling what it is,

01:46:34   21   how it works, how to make it, and how to use it.            The

01:46:41   22   specification concludes, or ends, with one or more numbered

01:46:44   23   sentences.     These numbered sentences are the patent claims.

01:46:50   24           When a patent is granted by the PTO, it is the

01:46:53   25   claims, ladies and gentlemen, that define the boundaries of
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 6 of 156 PageID #: 18467
                                                                                       131



01:46:57    1   the patent's protection and give notice to the public of

01:47:00    2   those boundaries.

01:47:01    3           Patent claims may exist in two forms referred to

01:47:06    4   as independent claims and dependent claims.

01:47:09    5           An independent claim does not refer to any other

01:47:13    6   claim in the patent.     It is independent.       It's not

01:47:16    7   necessary to look at any other claim in the patent to

01:47:20    8   determine what an independent claim covers.

01:47:22    9           On the other hand, a dependent claim refers to at

01:47:28   10   least one other claim in the patent.         A dependent claim

01:47:32   11   includes each limitation or element of that other claim or

01:47:38   12   claims from which it refers, or as we sometimes say, from

01:47:42   13   which it depends, as well as the additional elements or

01:47:46   14   limitations recited within the dependent claim itself.

01:47:49   15           Therefore, to determine what a dependent patent

01:47:54   16   claim covers, it's necessary to look at both the dependent

01:47:59   17   claim itself and the independent claim or claims from which

01:48:04   18   it refers, or as we say, from which it depends.

01:48:08   19           The claims of the patent-in-suit use the word

01:48:11   20   "comprising."   Comprising means including or containing.               A

01:48:16   21   claim that includes the word "comprising" is not limited to

01:48:19   22   the methods or devices having only the elements that are

01:48:24   23   recited in the claim but also includes methods or devices

01:48:28   24   that add additional elements.

01:48:30   25           Take, for example, a claim that covers a table.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 7 of 156 PageID #: 18468
                                                                                       132



01:48:36    1   If the claim recites a table comprising a tabletop, legs,

01:48:42    2   and glue, then the claim will cover any table that includes

01:48:46    3   these structures, even if it is a table that includes other

01:48:50    4   structures, such as a leaf to go in the top of the tabletop

01:48:54    5   or wheels to go on the bottom of the legs.

01:48:57    6              Now, that's a very simple example using the word

01:49:01    7   "comprising" and what it means.        In other words, ladies and

01:49:06    8   gentlemen, it can have other features in addition to those

01:49:11    9   that are covered by the patent.

01:49:12   10              After the applicant files the application with the

01:49:27   11   PTO, an examiner reviews the application to determine

01:49:33   12   whether or not the claims are patentable, that is to say,

01:49:37   13   appropriate for patent protection, and whether or not the

01:49:40   14   specification adequately describes the invention that's

01:49:46   15   claimed.

01:49:48   16              In examining a patent application, the examiner

01:49:50   17   reviews certain information about the state of the

01:49:55   18   technology at the time the application is filed.            The PTO

01:50:01   19   searches for and reviews this type of information that's

01:50:04   20   publicly available or that's submitted by the applicant.

01:50:08   21   This type of information is called prior art.

01:50:13   22              The examiner reviews this prior art to determine

01:50:15   23   whether or not the invention is truly an advance over the

01:50:19   24   state of the art at the time.

01:50:22   25              Prior art is defined by law, and I'll give you at
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 8 of 156 PageID #: 18469
                                                                                       133



01:50:25    1   a later time specific instructions as to what constitutes

01:50:28    2   prior art.   However, in general, prior art includes

01:50:33    3   information that demonstrates the state of the technology

01:50:37    4   that existed before the claimed invention was made or

01:50:41    5   before the application for the patent was filed.

01:50:43    6           A patent contains a list of certain prior art that

01:50:49    7   the examiner has considered.       The items on this list are

01:50:53    8   called the cited references.

01:50:56    9           After the prior art search by the examiner and the

01:51:00   10   examination of the application, the examiner informs the

01:51:04   11   applicant in writing of what the examiner has found and

01:51:08   12   whether the examiner considers any claim to be patentable,

01:51:14   13   in which case it will be allowed.        This writing from the

01:51:17   14   examiner is called an Office Action.

01:51:19   15           Now, if the examiner rejects the claims, the

01:51:23   16   applicant has the opportunity to respond to the examiner

01:51:27   17   and try to persuade the examiner to allow the claims.             The

01:51:31   18   applicant also has the chance to change or amend the claims

01:51:35   19   or to submit new claims.      And these papers generated in the

01:51:40   20   back-and-forth communications between the examiner and the

01:51:42   21   applicant are called the prosecution history.

01:51:47   22           And this process, this prosecution history

01:51:50   23   process, ladies and gentlemen, may go on back and forth

01:51:54   24   between the applicant -- applicant and the examiner for

01:51:56   25   some time until the examiner is ultimately satisfied that
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 9 of 156 PageID #: 18470
                                                                                       134



01:52:02    1   the application meets the requirements for a patent.

01:52:06    2           And in that case, the application issues as a

01:52:08    3   United States patent.     Or in the alternative, if the

01:52:13    4   examiner ultimately concludes that the application should

01:52:16    5   be rejected, then no patent is issued.

01:52:18    6           Sometimes patents are issued after appeals within

01:52:24    7   the PTO or to a court.

01:52:27    8           Now, the fact that the PTO grants a patent does

01:52:30    9   not necessarily mean that any invention claimed in the

01:52:33   10   patent, in fact, deserves the protection of a patent.

01:52:37   11           While an issued United States patent is presumed

01:52:40   12   to be valid under the law, a person accused of infringement

01:52:44   13   has the right to argue here in federal court that a claimed

01:52:48   14   invention in a patent is invalid.

01:52:52   15           Now, it's your job as the jury to consider the

01:52:54   16   evidence presented by the parties and determine

01:52:58   17   independently and for yourselves whether or not the

01:53:01   18   Defendants have proven that the -- that the patent-in-suit

01:53:05   19   is invalid.

01:53:06   20           Now, to help you follow the evidence, I'll give

01:53:11   21   you a brief summary of the positions of the two parties.

01:53:14   22           As you all know, the party that brings or

01:53:19   23   initiates a lawsuit is called the Plaintiff.           The Plaintiff

01:53:22   24   in this case is Vocalife LLC, which you'll hear referred to

01:53:26   25   throughout the trial either simply as the Plaintiff or as
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 10 of 156 PageID #: 18471
                                                                                     135



01:53:29    1   Vocalife.

01:53:30    2            And as you all know, the party against whom a

01:53:34    3   lawsuit is brought is called the Defendant.           The Defendants

01:53:37    4   in this case are Amazon.com, Inc., and Amazon.com LLC,

01:53:43    5   which you will hear referred to throughout the trial either

01:53:45    6   as the Defendants or simply as Amazon, which collectively

01:53:51    7   will refer to both Defendants.

01:53:53    8            Now, as I told you during jury selection earlier

01:53:56    9   today, this is a case of alleged patent infringement.               And

01:54:00   10   as I may have already mentioned, there is one United States

01:54:03   11   patent that's been asserted and is at issue in this case.

01:54:07   12            The asserted patent in this case is United States

01:54:11   13   Patent No. RE47,049.     As you've been told, patents are

01:54:19   14   commonly referred to by their last three digits.            So in

01:54:24   15   this case, the patent-in-suit, Patent No. RE47,049, will be

01:54:30   16   referred to almost every time as the '049 patent.

01:54:34   17            The asserted patent in this case is called a

01:54:38   18   reissue patent.    A reissue patent is a patent that is based

01:54:42   19   on an original patent that, for one reason or another, has

01:54:47   20   been determined to have a mistake or a flaw that needs to

01:54:50   21   be corrected and replaced.

01:54:52   22            The reissue patent is a patent that corrects and

01:54:57   23   takes the place of the original patent, which is

01:55:00   24   sometimes -- which is surrendered as a part of the

01:55:04   25   reissuance process.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 11 of 156 PageID #: 18472
                                                                                     136



01:55:06    1             In this case, the original patent from which the

01:55:09    2   '049 patent reissued is United States Patent No. 8,861,756,

01:55:16    3   and you'll hear this patent referred to throughout the

01:55:19    4   trial as the '756 patent.

01:55:24    5             And as I have said, the '756 patent has been

01:55:29    6   surrendered at the time the '049 patent was reissued.

01:55:33    7             Now, the '049 patent, the patent-in-suit, will be

01:55:39    8   referred to throughout the trial at various times as either

01:55:42    9   the patent-in-suit, and it will sometimes be called the

01:55:47   10   asserted patent.    Those references all mean the '049

01:55:54   11   patent.   And this patent generally -- generally relates to

01:55:57   12   smart speaker systems.

01:55:59   13             Now, the Plaintiff, Vocalife, contends that the

01:56:01   14   Defendants, Amazon, are willfully infringing certain claims

01:56:05   15   of the patent-in-suit by importing, making, or selling

01:56:09   16   products that include their patented technology.            Vocalife

01:56:14   17   also contends that Amazon has induced or contributed to and

01:56:18   18   continues to induce or contribute to infringement by

01:56:24   19   others.   Vocalife also contends that it's entitled to money

01:56:28   20   damages as a result of that infringement.

01:56:30   21             On the other hand, the Defendants, Amazon, deny

01:56:34   22   that they are infringing the Plaintiff's patent-in-suit.

01:56:39   23   And they contend that the asserted claims of the

01:56:42   24   patent-in-suit are invalid as either being anticipated or

01:56:46   25   obvious in the light of prior art.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 12 of 156 PageID #: 18473
                                                                                     137



01:56:49    1            Amazon also contends that the asserted claims of

01:56:53    2   the patent-in-suit are invalid because the patent's

01:56:58    3   specifications do not contain a sufficient written

01:57:00    4   description of the invention and do not enable a person

01:57:05    5   skilled in the art to make and use the invention.

01:57:07    6            Finally, Amazon contends that the asserted claims

01:57:10    7   of the patent-in-suit is invalid because it is inoperative.

01:57:16    8            Now, ladies and gentlemen, I know that there are a

01:57:19    9   lot of new words and new concepts that have been thrown at

01:57:23   10   you since you arrived at the courthouse this morning.             I'm

01:57:27   11   going to define a lot of those words and concepts for you

01:57:30   12   as we go through these instructions.

01:57:35   13            The attorneys in the case are going to discuss

01:57:37   14   them in their opening statements.

01:57:38   15            The witnesses that you hear during the course of

01:57:40   16   the trial are going to help you through their testimony to

01:57:42   17   understand those words and concepts.

01:57:47   18            So, please, do not feel overwhelmed at this early

01:57:51   19   stage.   I promise you, it will all come together as we go

01:57:54   20   through the trial.

01:57:55   21            One of your jobs in this case, ladies and

01:57:58   22   gentlemen, is to decide whether or not the asserted claims

01:58:01   23   of the asserted patent have been infringed and whether they

01:58:08   24   are invalid.

01:58:09   25            If you decide that any claim of the patent-in-suit
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 13 of 156 PageID #: 18474
                                                                                     138



01:58:12    1   has been infringed by the Defendants and is not invalid,

01:58:19    2   then you'll need to decide whether or not the Defendants'

01:58:23    3   infringement has been willful.

01:58:26    4            You'll also then need to decide what amount of

01:58:28    5   money damages should be awarded to the Plaintiff as

01:58:33    6   compensation for that infringement.

01:58:35    7            Now, my job in this case is to tell you what the

01:58:40    8   law is and to handle rulings on evidence and procedure and

01:58:43    9   to oversee the conduct of the trial.

01:58:46   10            In determining the law, it is specifically my job

01:58:48   11   to determine the meaning of any claim language from within

01:58:54   12   the asserted patent that needs interpretation.            I have

01:58:58   13   already determined the meanings of some of the claim

01:59:01   14   language of the patent-in-suit.        And you must accept those

01:59:06   15   meanings or constructions that I give you and use those

01:59:10   16   meanings when you decide whether any particular claim has

01:59:13   17   or has not been infringed and when you decide whether or

01:59:16   18   not any claim is invalid.

01:59:19   19            And you're going to be given a document in a few

01:59:24   20   minutes that reflect these meanings and interpretations

01:59:27   21   that I have already reached.

01:59:29   22            Now, for any claim language that I've not provided

01:59:32   23   you with a definition or a construction, you should apply

01:59:36   24   the plain and ordinary meaning of that claim language.             If

01:59:40   25   I have provided you with a definition or a construction,
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 14 of 156 PageID #: 18475
                                                                                     139



01:59:44    1   however, you must apply my definition to those terms and

01:59:49    2   that language throughout the case.

01:59:51    3            However, my interpretation of the language of the

01:59:55    4   claims should not be taken by you as an indication that I

01:59:59    5   have a personal opinion or any opinion at all regarding the

02:00:03    6   issues, such as infringement and invalidity.           Those issues,

02:00:08    7   ladies and gentlemen, are yours alone to decide.

02:00:10    8            Now, I'll provide you with more detailed

02:00:14    9   instructions on the meaning of the claims before you retire

02:00:18   10   to deliberate and to reach your verdict.

02:00:20   11            In deciding the issues that are before you, you'll

02:00:23   12   be asked to consider specific legal rules.           And I'll give

02:00:26   13   you an overview of those rules now.         And then at the

02:00:29   14   conclusion of the case, I'll give you a much more detailed

02:00:32   15   instruction.

02:00:32   16            The first issue that you're asked to decide is

02:00:37   17   whether the Defendants, Amazon, have infringed any of the

02:00:41   18   asserted claims of the patent-in-suit.

02:00:44   19            Infringement, ladies and gentlemen, is assessed on

02:00:46   20   a claim-by-claim basis.

02:00:53   21            And Vocalife, the Plaintiff, must prove to you by

02:00:57   22   a preponderance of the evidence that a claim has been

02:01:02   23   infringed; therefore, there can be infringement as to one

02:01:04   24   claim but no infringement as to another claim.

02:01:09   25            There are also a few different ways that a patent
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 15 of 156 PageID #: 18476
                                                                                     140



02:01:11    1   can be infringed.     And I will explain the requirements for

02:01:15    2   each of these types of infringements to you in detail at

02:01:18    3   the conclusion of the case.

02:01:19    4            But, in general, a Defendant may infringe the

02:01:25    5   asserted patent by making, using, selling, or offering for

02:01:30    6   sale into the -- in the United States or importing into the

02:01:33    7   United States a product meeting all the requirements of a

02:01:37    8   claim of the asserted patent.

02:01:40    9            As I say, I'll give you more detailed instructions

02:01:43   10   on the requirements for infringement at the conclusion of

02:01:45   11   the case.

02:01:46   12            Now, the second issue that you'll be asked to

02:01:48   13   decide is whether the asserted patent is invalid.

02:01:52   14            Invalidity is a defense to infringement.

02:01:56   15   Therefore, even though the United States Patent and

02:02:00   16   Trademark Office has allowed the asserted claims and even

02:02:03   17   though an issued United States patent is presumed to be

02:02:07   18   valid, you, the jury, must decide whether those claims are

02:02:13   19   invalid after hearing all the evidence presented during the

02:02:16   20   course of the trial.

02:02:17   21            You may find that a claim is invalid for a number

02:02:21   22   of reasons, including because it claims subject matter that

02:02:25   23   is not new or because it is obvious.

02:02:29   24            For a -- for a patent claim to be invalid because

02:02:33   25   it is not new, the Defendant must show you by clear and
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 16 of 156 PageID #: 18477
                                                                                     141



02:02:39    1   convincing evidence that all the elements or limitations of

02:02:43    2   a claim are sufficiently described in a single,

02:02:47    3   previously-printed publication or patent.

02:02:51    4            If a claim is not new, we say, ladies and

02:02:54    5   gentlemen, that it is anticipated.

02:02:57    6            Now, another way that a claim can be found to be

02:02:59    7   invalid is that it may have been obvious.          Even though a

02:03:04    8   claim may not be anticipated because every element of the

02:03:09    9   claim is not shown or sufficiently described in a single

02:03:13   10   piece of prior art, the claim may still be invalid if it

02:03:17   11   would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in

02:03:21   12   the field of the technology of the patent at the relevant

02:03:25   13   time.

02:03:26   14            You'll need to consider a number of questions in

02:03:29   15   deciding whether the invention claimed in the asserted --

02:03:33   16   the asserted patent is obvious, and I'll provide you with

02:03:38   17   more detailed instructions on these issues at the

02:03:42   18   conclusion of the trial.

02:03:43   19            Another way that a claim can be found to be

02:03:45   20   invalid is that there may have been a lack of a written

02:03:49   21   description.

02:03:49   22            A patent may be invalid if it's specification does

02:03:54   23   not describe the claimed invention in sufficient detail so

02:03:59   24   that one skilled in the art can reasonably conclude that

02:04:03   25   the inventor actually had possession of the invention that
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 17 of 156 PageID #: 18478
                                                                                     142



02:04:05    1   they're claiming.

02:04:08    2            A patent may also be invalid if the specification

02:04:12    3   does not adequately disclose to one skilled in the art how

02:04:16    4   to make or carry out the claimed invention without undue

02:04:21    5   experimentation.

02:04:25    6            A claim may also be found to be invalid if it is

02:04:29    7   inoperable.     A claim is inoperative if it is not useful or

02:04:34    8   it does not work.

02:04:35    9            If you decide that any claim of the patents in --

02:04:38   10   of the patent-in-suit has been infringed and you also

02:04:42   11   decide that it is not invalid, then you'll need to decide

02:04:48   12   whether the Defendants' infringement has been willful.

02:04:54   13   You'll also need to decide at that time what amount of

02:04:56   14   money damages should be awarded to the Plaintiff to

02:04:58   15   compensate it for the infringement by the Defendant.

02:05:02   16            A damage award, ladies and gentlemen, must be

02:05:07   17   adequate to compensate the patentholder for the

02:05:11   18   infringement.     And in no event may a damage award be less

02:05:16   19   than what the patentholder would have received if it had

02:05:21   20   been paid a reasonable royalty for the use of its patent.

02:05:24   21            However, the damages that you award, if any, are

02:05:27   22   meant to compensate the patentholder.         And they are not

02:05:29   23   meant to punish the Defendant.        And you may not include in

02:05:33   24   any damages that you might award an additional amount as a

02:05:38   25   fine or as a penalty or anything above what is necessary to
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 18 of 156 PageID #: 18479
                                                                                     143



02:05:43    1   fully compensate the patentholder for the infringement.

02:05:47    2              Also, damages cannot be speculative, and the

02:05:53    3   Plaintiff, Vocalife, must prove the amount of its damages

02:05:56    4   for the alleged infringement by a preponderance of the

02:05:59    5   evidence.

02:06:03    6              I'll give you more detailed instructions on the

02:06:05    7   calculation of damages for the alleged infringement at the

02:06:10    8   conclusion of the trial, including giving you specific

02:06:12    9   instructions with regard to the calculation of a reasonable

02:06:17   10   royalty.    However, the fact that I'm instructing you on

02:06:20   11   damages does not mean that Vocalife is or is not entitled

02:06:24   12   to recover damages.

02:06:26   13              Now, over the course of the trial, ladies and

02:06:29   14   gentlemen, you're going to be hearing from a number of

02:06:34   15   witnesses in this case.      And I want you to keep an open

02:06:37   16   mind while you're listening to the evidence and not to

02:06:39   17   decide any of the facts until you have heard all the

02:06:44   18   evidence from all the witnesses.

02:06:49   19              This is important.    While the witnesses are

02:06:51   20   testifying, remember that you will have to decide the

02:06:54   21   degree of credibility and believability to allocate to each

02:06:58   22   and every of the witnesses and the evidence that they

02:07:01   23   present.

02:07:05   24              So while the witnesses are testifying, you should

02:07:07   25   be asking yourselves things like this:          Does the witness

                                                                                     144



02:07:10    1   impress you as being truthful?        Does he or she have a

02:07:13    2   reason not to tell the truth?       Does he or she have any

02:07:17    3   personal interest in the outcome of the case?           Does the

02:07:21    4   witness seem to have a good memory?         Did he or she have an

02:07:25    5   opportunity and ability to observe accurately the things

02:07:28    6   that they've testified about?       Did the witness appear to

02:07:35    7   understand the questions clearly and answer them directly?

02:07:39    8   And, of course, does the witness's testimony differ from

02:07:41    9   the testimony of any other witness, and if it does, how

02:07:44   10   does it differ?

02:07:46   11            These are some of the kinds of things you should

02:07:51   12   be thinking about while you're listening to each of the

02:07:53   13   witnesses over the course of this trial.

02:07:55   14            Now, I also want to talk to you briefly about

02:07:58   15   expert witnesses.     When knowledge of a technical subject

02:08:02   16   may be helpful to you, the jury, a person who has special

02:08:06   17   training and experience in that particular field -- we call

02:08:11   18   them an expert witness -- is permitted to testify to you

02:08:14   19   about his or her opinions on those technical matters.

02:08:20   20            However, you're not required to accept an expert's

02:08:23   21   opinion or any witness's opinion at all.          It's up to you to

02:08:27   22   decide whether you believe any expert witness who testifies

02:08:31   23   in this case and whether you believe what they say is

02:08:35   24   correct or incorrect or whether or not you want to believe

02:08:38   25   it.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 20 of 156 PageID #: 18481
                                                                                     145



02:08:38    1            Now, I anticipate that there will be expert

02:08:41    2   witnesses testifying in support of both the Plaintiff and

02:08:45    3   the Defendant in this case.       But when that happens, it will

02:08:49    4   be up to you to listen to their qualifications.

02:08:53    5            And when they give an opinion and explain the

02:08:55    6   basis for that opinion, you will have to evaluate what they

02:09:00    7   say, whether you believe it, and to what degree, if any,

02:09:03    8   that you want to give it weight in your considerations.

02:09:06    9            Remember, ladies and gentlemen, judging and

02:09:09   10   evaluating the credibility and believability of each and

02:09:13   11   every witness is an important part of your job as jurors.

02:09:18   12            Now, during the trial, it's possible that

02:09:22   13   testimony will be presented from one or more witnesses that

02:09:25   14   are going to be presented to you through what we call a

02:09:28   15   deposition.

02:09:28   16            In trials like this, it's difficult to get every

02:09:33   17   witness physically present in court at the same time.             So

02:09:37   18   before the trial, lawyers for each side take the

02:09:40   19   depositions of the witnesses.

02:09:43   20            In a deposition, a court reporter is present, the

02:09:47   21   witness is there and is sworn and placed under oath.

02:09:50   22   Counsel for both sides are there.        And then the lawyers ask

02:09:54   23   the witnesses questions, and the witnesses answer those

02:09:59   24   questions.    And both the questions and the answers are

02:10:01   25   recorded and taken down.      Often those questions and answers
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 21 of 156 PageID #: 18482
                                                                                     146



02:10:06    1   are recorded not only in writing but by a video recording,

02:10:10    2   as well.

02:10:10    3              It's important to understand, ladies and

02:10:12    4   gentlemen, that these depositions often go on for multiple

02:10:16    5   hours at a time.

02:10:20    6              So with regard to witnesses who may be presented

02:10:22    7   to you in this trial by deposition, rather than have you

02:10:25    8   listen to the entirety of the deposition and the hours and

02:10:29    9   hours of it, the parties will select those portions they

02:10:33   10   think are important to present to you, and those deposition

02:10:37   11   designations and counter designations by the other party

02:10:40   12   will be put together and played to you as a single

02:10:43   13   presentation during the course of the trial.

02:10:46   14              That means during these witnesses who appear by

02:10:50   15   deposition, you may see or hear a different person begin to

02:10:55   16   ask questions and hear a different voice.          Don't think that

02:10:58   17   you're missing something or something has been cut out.

02:11:02   18   That's simply the process of taking the Plaintiff's

02:11:06   19   designations and the Defendants' designations of that

02:11:08   20   single witness from the entirety of the deposition and

02:11:10   21   putting them together for a shortened, focused version to

02:11:14   22   present to you as that deposition witness's testimony

02:11:19   23   during the trial.

02:11:20   24              Now, the deposition testimony that may be

02:11:28   25   presented to you during the trial, I want you to
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 22 of 156 PageID #: 18483
                                                                                     147



02:11:32    1   understand, that is entitled to the same consideration by

02:11:37    2   you as any other witness.       And insofar as possible, it's to

02:11:41    3   be judged -- deposition testimony is to be judged, weighed

02:11:44    4   as to credibility, and otherwise considered by the jury in

02:11:47    5   the same way as if the witness had been present in person

02:11:51    6   and testified physically from the witness stand.

02:11:54    7            Now, during the course of the trial, it's possible

02:11:57    8   that lawyers will lodge certain objections.           And I'll make

02:12:01    9   rulings on those objections if that happens.

02:12:04   10            It's the duty of an attorney for each side of the

02:12:07   11   case to object when the other side offers testimony or

02:12:11   12   other evidence that the attorney believes isn't proper

02:12:17   13   under the rules of the Court and the Rules of Evidence.

02:12:20   14            Now, upon allowing the testimony or other evidence

02:12:23   15   to be introduced over the objection of an attorney, the

02:12:26   16   Court does not, unless expressly stated, indicate any

02:12:30   17   opinion as to the weight or effect of such evidence.

02:12:34   18   Again, it is your job as the jury to weigh the credibility

02:12:37   19   and effect and believability of the witness -- of the

02:12:41   20   evidence, rather, from every witness.

02:12:43   21            Now, I want to compliment the parties in this case

02:12:47   22   because prior to today, they have worked with the Court

02:12:52   23   very diligently to go through all the exhibits that will be

02:12:57   24   shown to you during the course of the trial.

02:12:58   25            And in those efforts that took place during the
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 23 of 156 PageID #: 18484
                                                                                     148



02:13:00    1   pre-trial hearings, that you were not required to be

02:13:03    2   present for, any exhibit that was challenged was taken up

02:13:09    3   by the Court, the Court considered its admissibility under

02:13:12    4   the Rules of Evidence, and ruled as to whether that exhibit

02:13:15    5   was proper or improper.

02:13:19    6            That means that all those arguments and all those

02:13:21    7   decisions have been already made, so you are not going to

02:13:25    8   have to sit through that part of the process during the

02:13:27    9   trial.

02:13:30   10            That means when an lawyer offers an exhibit and

02:13:33   11   publishes it and uses it before you, it's already been

02:13:36   12   found by the Court to be admissible.         They do not have to

02:13:41   13   go through a formal presentation process, we do not have to

02:13:44   14   hear objections, and I do not have to enter rulings.             All

02:13:47   15   of that has been already done.

02:13:48   16            So when an exhibit is presented during the trial,

02:13:52   17   you may consider it as proper.        The lawyer will present it

02:13:55   18   with the witness, put it in the proper context, and you are

02:13:59   19   able to consider it without going through the additional

02:14:01   20   time necessary to make all those determinations.

02:14:04   21            You may not understand this, ladies and gentlemen,

02:14:06   22   but we have saved you hours and hours by going through that

02:14:09   23   before the trial started.       And I want to compliment both

02:14:12   24   the Plaintiff and the Defendant and their counsel for

02:14:15   25   working with the Court to accomplish that.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 24 of 156 PageID #: 18485
                                                                                     149



02:14:17    1            However, it's still possible that over the course

02:14:26    2   of the trial objections may arise.

02:14:30    3            If I should sustain an objection to a question

02:14:33    4   addressed to a witness, then you must disregard that

02:14:36    5   question entirely, and you can draw -- should draw no

02:14:41    6   inference from its wordings, and you should not speculate

02:14:44    7   about what the witness would have said if I had permitted

02:14:47    8   them to answer the question.

02:14:48    9            On the other hand, if I overrule an objection,

02:14:56   10   then you should consider the question fully and the answer

02:14:58   11   fully as if no objection had ever been made.

02:15:01   12            Now, you should also understand, ladies and

02:15:03   13   gentlemen, that the law of the United States permits a

02:15:06   14   United States District Judge to comment to the jury

02:15:11   15   regarding the evidence, but such comments from the Judge on

02:15:15   16   the evidence are only an expression of the Judge's opinion,

02:15:18   17   and the jury may disregard those comments in their

02:15:21   18   entirety, because, as I've told you several times now, you,

02:15:26   19   the jury, are the sole judges of the facts.           You are the

02:15:28   20   sole judges of the credibility and believability of the

02:15:32   21   witnesses and how much weight, if any, you want to give to

02:15:37   22   each and every part of the evidence that's presented over

02:15:39   23   the trial.

02:15:39   24            Now, even though the law may permit me to comment

02:15:43   25   on the evidence in this case, as I told you earlier, my
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 25 of 156 PageID #: 18486
                                                                                     150



02:15:45    1   intention is to try very hard not to comment on any of the

02:15:49    2   evidence throughout the trial.

02:15:52    3            And you should not take any comments or

02:15:54    4   expressions or indications of any kind that you see from me

02:15:57    5   or you think you see from me as being a factor for your

02:16:01    6   consideration regarding the ultimate facts in this case.

02:16:09    7            Now, our court reporter in front of me,

02:16:12    8   Ms. Holmes, is taking down everything that is said in the

02:16:14    9   courtroom during the course of the trial, but the written

02:16:16   10   transcript of everything that's said in the courtroom is

02:16:19   11   not going to be available to you to consider during your

02:16:23   12   deliberations.    That transcript is -- is prepared in case

02:16:30   13   there is an appeal of this Court's decision to a higher

02:16:32   14   Court.

02:16:32   15            So each of you, ladies and gentlemen, are going to

02:16:34   16   have to rely on your memories of the evidence during your

02:16:39   17   deliberations in this case.

02:16:40   18            Now, in a moment, each of you are going to be

02:16:43   19   given a juror notebook.      In the back of that notebook

02:16:50   20   you're going to find a brand new legal pad that you can use

02:16:53   21   the blank pages of to take notes on over the course of the

02:16:56   22   trial, if you decide you want to take notes.

02:16:58   23            It's up to each of you to decide whether or not

02:17:00   24   you want to take notes, and if you do, how extensive you

02:17:03   25   want those notes to be.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 26 of 156 PageID #: 18487
                                                                                     151



02:17:05    1            But if you do, remember, those notes are for your

02:17:09    2   own personal notes only.      You still have to rely on your

02:17:12    3   memory of the evidence, and that's why you should pay close

02:17:14    4   attention to the testimony of each and every witness.

02:17:16    5            You should not abandon your own recollection of

02:17:22    6   the evidence because some other juror's notes indicate

02:17:25    7   something differently.      Notes are to refresh your

02:17:27    8   recollection -- your notes that you take are to refresh

02:17:32    9   your recollection of the evidence, and that's the only

02:17:34   10   reason you should be taking them.

02:17:36   11            Now, at this time, I'm going to ask Mr. Johnston,

02:17:39   12   our Court Security Officer, to pass out these juror

02:17:41   13   notebooks to each member of the jury.

02:18:28   14            Thank you, Mr. Johnston.

02:18:31   15            In these notebooks, ladies and gentlemen, you'll

02:18:33   16   see that you each have a copy of the asserted patent, the

02:18:40   17   '049 patent, that we've talked about.

02:18:42   18            You'll also find a section of tabbed pages for all

02:18:46   19   of the witnesses that we expect may testify over the course

02:18:49   20   of the trial.    And behind those tabs, you'll find a page

02:18:53   21   for each witness with their head and shoulders photograph

02:18:56   22   superimposed at the top of the page.

02:18:58   23            The Court often finds that jurors benefit from

02:19:03   24   being able to see a picture of the person that testified

02:19:06   25   when they're trying to reconstruct and reconsider all the

02:19:10    1   evidence that's been given over the course of a trial.

02:19:12    2            Below the photograph of each witness, there are

02:19:17    3   lines that you can also use to take additional notes on, on

02:19:19    4   those pages if you choose to.

02:19:21    5            You'll also find in there a list of the claim

02:19:24    6   terms or language that the Court has already construed and

02:19:28    7   given you definitions or constructions for.

02:19:32    8            Again, those constructions, those definitions that

02:19:36    9   the Court has given you must be applied by you to the

02:19:39   10   language of the claims when you decide the issues of

02:19:42   11   infringement and invalidity.

02:19:43   12            Now, these notebooks, ladies and gentlemen, should

02:19:48   13   be in your possession at all times.         They're not to be left

02:19:53   14   unattended to.    They should either be with you in the jury

02:19:56   15   box where you have them now, or at the end of the day when

02:20:01   16   you leave, you should take them to the jury room and leave

02:20:04   17   them closed on the table in the jury room so that you can

02:20:07   18   pick them up the next morning.

02:20:08   19            Now, there may be times over the course of the

02:20:10   20   trial when we're going to take a brief recess and only be

02:20:14   21   out of the courtroom a matter of a few minutes.            In that

02:20:17   22   case, I may very well say, ladies and gentlemen, you may

02:20:20   23   simply close and leave your notebooks in your chairs.

02:20:24   24            And, in that case, just leave them in your chairs,

02:20:26   25   recess to the jury room, and then when we're back in a
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 28 of 156 PageID #: 18489
                                                                                     153



02:20:29    1   short period of time, they'll be there waiting for you.

02:20:32    2            But if we're going to be out of the courtroom for

02:20:36    3   any length of time, I'm going to ask you to take those

02:20:39    4   juror notebooks with you and keep them in your possession.

02:20:43    5            You'll also find, I think, in the front flap of

02:20:46    6   those notebooks a pen for note-taking in case you don't

02:20:51    7   already have one.

02:20:51    8            Now, in a moment, ladies and gentlemen, the

02:20:55    9   attorneys for the parties are going to present their

02:20:58   10   opening statements.     Those opening statements are intended

02:21:01   11   to give you a roadmap of what each side expects to offer

02:21:05   12   through the evidence that they'll present.

02:21:08   13            And you should remember throughout this trial,

02:21:11   14   ladies and gentlemen, that what the lawyers tell you is not

02:21:13   15   evidence.   Let me say that again.       What the lawyers tell

02:21:18   16   you is not evidence.

02:21:22   17            The evidence in this case is the sworn testimony

02:21:24   18   of the witnesses presented under oath and subject to

02:21:27   19   cross-examination from the witness stand in open court or

02:21:32   20   from that sworn testimony presented to you by deposition

02:21:35   21   that I described earlier.

02:21:37   22            And it includes the exhibits which the Court has

02:21:40   23   determined to be properly admissible and which are shown to

02:21:43   24   you over the course of the trial.        That is the evidence in

02:21:48   25   the case.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 29 of 156 PageID #: 18490
                                                                                     154



02:21:48    1            What the lawyers tell you is not evidence in the

02:21:53    2   case, but simply it's what their impression is of the

02:21:58    3   evidence, and they have a duty to point out to you what

02:22:01    4   they believe the evidence is.       But, remember, what they're

02:22:03    5   telling you is not evidence.

02:22:04    6            Now, after the opening statements are given by

02:22:07    7   both Plaintiff and then Defendant, the Plaintiff will

02:22:10    8   present its witnesses and present its evidence in the case.

02:22:15    9   That's called the Plaintiff's case-in-chief.

02:22:18   10            And after the Defendants -- excuse me, after the

02:22:21   11   Plaintiffs have called their witnesses and presented their

02:22:24   12   evidence, they will rest their case-in-chief.

02:22:26   13            When the Plaintiffs rest their case-in-chief, then

02:22:34   14   the Defendants will present their evidence and call their

02:22:36   15   witnesses, and that will constitute the Defendants'

02:22:38   16   case-in-chief.

02:22:39   17            And when the Defendants have presented all their

02:22:41   18   witnesses and evidence, the Defendants will rest their

02:22:44   19   case-in-chief.

02:22:45   20            When the Defendants rest their case-in-chief, then

02:22:48   21   the Plaintiff has the opportunity to call rebuttal

02:22:52   22   witnesses to rebut what the Defendants have shown.            And

02:22:57   23   that evidence, if the Plaintiffs choose to present it, is

02:23:00   24   called the Plaintiff's rebuttal case.

02:23:03   25            When the Plaintiff's rebuttal case, if there is
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 30 of 156 PageID #: 18491
                                                                                     155



02:23:05    1   one, is concluded, then and at that point, you will have

02:23:09    2   heard all the evidence in this case.

02:23:14    3            And at that time, I will give you written

02:23:15    4   instructions about the law to apply, and you will have a

02:23:19    5   copy of my written instructions to take with you to the

02:23:22    6   jury room and to consider during your deliberations.

02:23:25    7            These final instructions that I will give you

02:23:30    8   after you've heard all the evidence are sometimes called

02:23:33    9   the Court's charge to the jury.

02:23:35   10            After I have given you my final instructions, or

02:23:39   11   as it's sometimes called the Court's charge to the jury,

02:23:42   12   then the parties will present their closing arguments.             The

02:23:46   13   Plaintiff will present first, then the Defendant, then the

02:23:49   14   Plaintiff gets a final closing argument.

02:23:51   15            Those closing arguments will be presented to you,

02:23:55   16   and when you have heard the closing arguments of both

02:23:58   17   sides, then I will instruct you to retire to the jury room

02:24:03   18   and to consider and return a verdict in this case.

02:24:06   19            Let me -- let me repeat my earlier instruction to

02:24:12   20   you.   You are not to discuss this case or communicate about

02:24:16   21   this case with anyone, including the eight members of the

02:24:22   22   jury, until such time as you have heard all the evidence, I

02:24:27   23   have given you my final instructions on the law, and

02:24:29   24   counsel for both sides have presented their closing

02:24:33   25   arguments.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 31 of 156 PageID #: 18492
                                                                                     156



02:24:33    1              At that point in time, when I direct you to retire

02:24:36    2   to the jury room and to deliberate on your verdict, then

02:24:40    3   everything changes.

02:24:41    4              And at that point, you go from not being able to

02:24:44    5   discuss the case among the eight of you to being required

02:24:47    6   to discuss the case among the eight of you.           But at that

02:24:53    7   point, when you first discuss the case among yourselves,

02:24:56    8   you will have heard all the evidence.

02:24:58    9              That's why it's important that you not discuss the

02:25:00   10   case among yourselves until that time, before you've heard

02:25:04   11   all the evidence, before you've received my final

02:25:08   12   instructions, and before you've heard closing arguments of

02:25:10   13   counsel.

02:25:11   14              Let me also remind you again, as I did before

02:25:16   15   lunch, over the course of the next week or so while we try

02:25:19   16   this case, when you come in close contact with any of the

02:25:23   17   people associated with either Plaintiff or Defendant,

02:25:26   18   they're not going to speak, they're not going to be

02:25:30   19   engaging, they're not going to be friendly.           That's what

02:25:33   20   I've required of them.

02:25:34   21              Don't hold that against them.       Don't think they're

02:25:36   22   being rude or unfriendly.       Remember, that's my requirement

02:25:39   23   to them, again, so that the only information you have is

02:25:44   24   what's presented to you over the course of the trial

02:25:46   25   through the sworn testimony of the witnesses and the
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 32 of 156 PageID #: 18493
                                                                                     157



02:25:49    1   exhibits that are introduced and a part of the evidence in

02:25:52    2   the case.

02:25:52    3              All right.   Ladies and gentlemen, those are my

02:25:56    4   preliminary instructions to you.        And at this time, we're

02:25:59    5   going to proceed to hear opening statements from the

02:26:02    6   parties.

02:26:02    7              We'll proceed first with the Plaintiff.         Plaintiff

02:26:05    8   may present its opening statement to the jury.

02:26:10    9              Would you like a warning on your time,

02:26:12   10   Mr. Fabricant?

02:26:12   11              MR. FABRICANT:   Yes, Your Honor, if I could please

02:26:15   12   have five minutes and then two minutes.

02:26:16   13              THE COURT:   Five minutes and two minutes.         I will

02:26:19   14   do that.

02:26:19   15              MR. FABRICANT:   Thank you.

02:26:19   16              THE COURT:   You may proceed when you're ready.

02:26:20   17              MR. FABRICANT:   Thank you, Your Honor.        May it

02:26:23   18   please the Court.

02:26:23   19              Welcome to the members of the jury.        As you heard

02:26:30   20   this morning from Mr. Dacus during jury selection, my name

02:26:34   21   is Fred Fabricant.      I am not a Texan.     I am from the great

02:26:40   22   state of New York.

02:26:42   23              But I do spend a lot of time in Texas and spend a

02:26:46   24   lot of time in Marshall, Texas, working with Sam Baxter and

02:26:50   25   Jennifer Truelove, and many other attorneys in this
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 33 of 156 PageID #: 18494
                                                                                     158



02:26:52    1   district.    And I've been coming here for nearly 20 years

02:26:56    2   working on patent cases in this Eastern District of Texas.

02:26:58    3              Just let me tell you a little bit about myself

02:27:00    4   because I didn't get to introduce myself.

02:27:03    5              I have been married happily for 47 years.          I have

02:27:07    6   three grown adult daughters and I have three

02:27:12    7   granddaughters.     And, finally we did get that little

02:27:14    8   grandson.    So a little bit about myself.

02:27:16    9              At the table here, Plaintiff's table today with

02:27:19   10   me, is Dr. Li.    Dr. Li is the owner of Vocalife.          And he

02:27:22   11   will be our first witness today.        So when we're done with

02:27:27   12   opening statements, Dr. Li will testify.

02:27:28   13              Also, at the table is Jennifer Truelove, who you

02:27:32   14   met this morning.     And Peter Lambrianakos, my partner, and

02:27:36   15   my partner, Vincent Rubino, both of whom will be

02:27:38   16   participating throughout the next week.

02:27:40   17              So who is Vocalife?     It's not a brand name that

02:27:51   18   one recognizes like Amazon, that's for sure.           It is a small

02:27:55   19   company located in Plano, Texas, and it's a research and

02:28:00   20   development company.     But it also is a company which makes

02:28:02   21   product.    And Vocalife, as you've heard, is the owner of

02:28:05   22   the '049 patent, which is the patent in this lawsuit.

02:28:06   23              And Vocalife develops and sells microphone array

02:28:11   24   and speaker recognition and noise cancellation products.

02:28:15   25   And they sell those products to private companies and to
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 34 of 156 PageID #: 18495
                                                                                     159



02:28:19    1   the U.S. Government even.

02:28:20    2             They sell presently their product to the Internal

02:28:23    3   Revenue Service.    And that product is used by the Internal

02:28:27    4   Revenue Service in conference rooms where people have to

02:28:29    5   come in for interviews, for meetings with the IRS.            They're

02:28:32    6   able to sit at a table with this product, and it's able to

02:28:35    7   detect people speaking from all over the room, because

02:28:39    8   that's what the invention of the '049 product is.

02:28:40    9             This is the embodiment in the Vocalife product of

02:28:47   10   the patent.

02:28:48   11             On the left is the CrispMic II microphone, and

02:28:52   12   that is a product which can detect speech from anywhere in

02:28:56   13   a room.   It can determine the location of the speaker.            It

02:29:01   14   can determine the direction of the speaker.           It canceled --

02:29:05   15   cancels noise.

02:29:07   16             And this particular product is in a circular array

02:29:09   17   because that works very, very well in helping to detect

02:29:14   18   where a speaker is speaking from.

02:29:16   19             In order to control the type of things that we all

02:29:19   20   control today on the Internet, like using the Echo product,

02:29:24   21   that device has to be able to recognize the speech.             Play

02:29:28   22   Billy Joel on Spotify in my kitchen.         It has to be able to

02:29:32   23   understand that.    And that's what this product does.

02:29:34   24             The pictures on the left are what the inside of

02:29:37   25   that device looks like, and those internal parts are also

                                                                                     160



02:29:41    1   sold separately, because some manufacturers want to use

02:29:44    2   their own device, but they'll buy the internal microphone

02:29:47    3   array to put into their own device, as Amazon could have

02:29:52    4   done to put into the Echo, had they respected the patent.

02:29:56    5              Mr. -- Dr. Li -- Dr. Li is a Ph.D. in electrical

02:30:01    6   engineering.     He's the owner of Vocalife.       He also has a

02:30:07    7   sister company called Li Technology -- Li Creative

02:30:10    8   Technologies.     And he is the co-inventor of the '049

02:30:12    9   patent.

02:30:12   10              He was also a research scientist for years at the

02:30:16   11   Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, which is one of the most

02:30:19   12   famous research laboratories in the world.           And I believe

02:30:22   13   the most Nobel laureates of any research laboratory.

02:30:28   14              Also, testifying this week will be the

02:30:31   15   co-inventor, Dr. Manli Zhu, Ph.D. from Ohio State

02:30:35   16   University.     And she was the co-inventor of the '049.          And

02:30:37   17   her specialty -- and this is really the genius of the

02:30:40   18   invention -- her specialty is in developing the software

02:30:43   19   and the algorithms which make this thing work.            It's the

02:30:46   20   intelligence.

02:30:48   21              Anybody can buy microphones.       Anybody can buy

02:30:51   22   plastic.    Anybody can buy a processor and stick it in a

02:30:55   23   little container.     But it's the algorithms, the

02:30:59   24   mathematics, the genius of the software, all brought

02:31:02   25   together onto a single processor so that it can work in

                                                                                     161



02:31:05    1   this tiny little device, which we'll show you.

02:31:07    2             And a very -- I think it's important to understand

02:31:13    3   that Dr. Li and Dr. Manli Zhu didn't know each other long

02:31:17    4   ago.   They both were born and grew up in China, and they

02:31:19    5   wanted to get out of China and live the American dream.

02:31:22    6             They wanted to come to the United States for a

02:31:25    7   fine education, to advance their careers, and to get into

02:31:28    8   research and development in the United States.

02:31:29    9             And that's what they both did.        And they both went

02:31:32   10   to American colleges for their Master's and Doctorate.             And

02:31:38   11   they both became citizens of the United States.            Dr. Li has

02:31:42   12   been a citizen since 1999 and Dr. Zhu since 2018.

02:31:45   13             So this case, as we've heard, is about the '049

02:31:48   14   patent.   The '049 patent -- and this is very important to

02:31:53   15   understand -- it issued in 2018, and it shows the

02:31:56   16   inventors, but its date -- its priority date, the date for

02:32:03   17   which you have to consider all prior inventions, its date

02:32:06   18   is September 24, 2010.      That's the priority date.

02:32:10   19             So when you hear about prior art, when you hear

02:32:12   20   about any prior art that you should consider to invalidate,

02:32:15   21   it has to be before 2010, because that's the date of

02:32:21   22   invention here.    That's the priority date.

02:32:22   23             And it did spring off of the '056 patent, which --

02:32:29   24   the '756 patent, I'm sorry.       As the Judge explained during

02:32:32   25   his opening instructions, the '756 patent was the original
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 37 of 156 PageID #: 18498
                                                                                     162



02:32:36    1   patent, and then it was subsequent -- subsequently reissued

02:32:40    2   so that broader claims were allowed.         And the '756 patent

02:32:44    3   was the original patent.

02:32:46    4              But you'll see on the right side, the filing date,

02:32:49    5   the September 24, 2010, was still the priority date.

02:32:54    6   That's the date we always have to remember when we're

02:32:57    7   considering prior art.

02:32:57    8              Now, these are a sample of the accused Amazon Echo

02:33:03    9   devices.    The small Dot, the bigger Echo, those are the

02:33:09   10   smart speakers that you put into your homes that control

02:33:12   11   thermostats, that control Spotify, that allow you to speak

02:33:17   12   to them.

02:33:18   13              They were launched in 2014 by Amazon.         But you'll

02:33:21   14   hear lots of evidence throughout this case and you'll see

02:33:23   15   in a moment with some of the exhibits, which we will see

02:33:26   16   later today, that Dr. Li brought his technology to Amazon

02:33:28   17   in 2011 at their invitation, demonstrated it, presented it,

02:33:35   18   gave them all the technology, gave them the paperwork, gave

02:33:38   19   them everything.    And then in 2014, three years later, look

02:33:43   20   what they came out with.

02:33:45   21              Now, there was a problem.      When you consider

02:33:50   22   invalidity, when you consider whether this was obvious

02:33:53   23   before 2010, consider one thing.        This was not an easy

02:33:58   24   task.   Amazon will admit, it took them years in their own

02:34:02   25   laboratory to supposedly develop this technology, was
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 38 of 156 PageID #: 18499
                                                                                     163



02:34:04    1   something that one of the biggest companies in the world

02:34:09    2   took years to develop, they went to Dr. Li and his small

02:34:11    3   company to try to get the technology.         You'll see they also

02:34:15    4   went to many other small companies and investigated and

02:34:18    5   evaluated their technology, as well.

02:34:20    6            The problem was very complex.         It's simple to put

02:34:23    7   a microphone in front of a person if you know the person is

02:34:25    8   going to be right in front of the microphone, like I am

02:34:28    9   here, and speak into the microphone.         That's easy.

02:34:32   10            But if a microphone sitting in the middle of the

02:34:34   11   back of the courtroom has to hear me say, "Alexa, play

02:34:38   12   Billy Joel," that's not easy.

02:34:40   13            Dr. Li worked on this technology.          He had a first

02:34:48   14   product called CrispMic I, which was developed between 2002

02:34:53   15   and 2008, which is not this technology.          It's more like the

02:34:56   16   simple old microphone array that you would put on a

02:35:00   17   computer or be sold to ATM machines, to NCR, so it could

02:35:07   18   speak to an ATM machine.

02:35:08   19            But then he decided I want to solve the problem.

02:35:08   20   Because of the way the world is going with the Internet, I

02:35:10   21   want a device that can pick up a sound from anywhere in the

02:35:14   22   room and detect it and recognize it.

02:35:16   23            So what did he do?      It took him from 2008 to 2010

02:35:20   24   to develop that product.      And he did that with Dr. Manli

02:35:23   25   Zhu, who is an expert at these algorithms, at making

                                                                                     164



02:35:28    1   hardware work the way you want it to work, something Amazon

02:35:32    2   couldn't do.

02:35:32    3            So infringement.      It is our burden, the

02:35:39    4   Plaintiff's burden, to prove infringement by a

02:35:41    5   preponderance of the evidence.        No question about that.

02:35:43    6            And as we saw this morning, that means that the

02:35:45    7   Scales of Justice must tip ever so slightly in favor of

02:35:49    8   Vocalife for this jury to find that Amazon, in fact,

02:35:54    9   infringed.     And that's what we're going to prove to you.

02:35:56   10            Now, here's a -- the first claim, which is a claim

02:36:00   11   in this lawsuit.     And I want to hit on some words because

02:36:03   12   you're going to be hearing these words all week long.             And

02:36:06   13   by the end of this jury trial, I think you'll be mini

02:36:10   14   experts on microwave -- microphone arrays.

02:36:13   15            So here are the key words.        These are the elements

02:36:15   16   of the claim of this patent.       It's a microphone array which

02:36:20   17   has the elements of a sound source localization unit, an

02:36:28   18   adaptive beamforming unit, and a noise reduction unit, all

02:36:31   19   contained in a single processor.        That is what this

02:36:35   20   invention is all about.

02:36:36   21            So you're going to be hearing from both the

02:36:38   22   Plaintiff and the Defendant about whether or not the Amazon

02:36:41   23   products have a microphone array with a sound source

02:36:44   24   localization unit, an adaptive beamforming unit, and a

02:36:47   25   noise reduction unit.      And you'll hear testimony from many

                                                                                     165



02:36:50    1   witnesses on that subject.

02:36:52    2              What does a patent cover?      Well, a patent is very

02:36:57    3   much like real property, except it's intellectual property.

02:37:01    4   It's a piece of paper.      But you have to think of it in

02:37:04    5   terms of a deed.

02:37:05    6              Just like a -- a piece of real estate, if you

02:37:11    7   owned a piece of real estate, it would have boundaries, and

02:37:15    8   your deed would tell you what those boundaries are, and

02:37:18    9   that's your property.

02:37:19   10              Well, the claims of a patent are exactly the same

02:37:21   11   thing.     They tell you what the scope of your ownership

02:37:26   12   interest is.     What do you own?     It's what the claim says

02:37:29   13   you own.

02:37:30   14              And so if you have an oil well and it's on your

02:37:33   15   property, you own it.      If it's not on your property, you

02:37:37   16   don't own it.

02:37:37   17              And I believe you'll agree at the end of this

02:37:44   18   trial that the invention of the '049 patent with these

02:37:48   19   elements of microphone array, sound source localization

02:37:50   20   unit, adaptive beamforming unit, noise reduction unit,

02:37:55   21   that's the scope of the property line.

02:37:58   22              And you will find, I hope and I believe, based on

02:38:01   23   the testimony and the evidence you will see, that that is

02:38:03   24   our property, and that Amazon practiced our invention.

02:38:07   25              Now, what -- for what purposes can you use this
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 41 of 156 PageID #: 18502
                                                                                     166



02:38:12    1   invention?   Well, the patent specification makes clear many

02:38:16    2   examples of the uses of this invention.          Those are called

02:38:19    3   the embodiments in the specification.

02:38:21    4            And you'll see here, this is just one example of

02:38:23    5   one embodiment, but what I highlighted was what I wanted

02:38:26    6   you to see, which is that the microphone array system

02:38:30    7   disclosed herein can further be implemented in conference

02:38:35    8   phones, videoconferencing applications, or any device or

02:38:39    9   equipment that needs better speech inputs.

02:38:44   10            In other words, if it's a device like this and it

02:38:46   11   meets the element of the claims, then you are within the

02:38:50   12   scope of what Vocalife owns.

02:38:53   13            And that means that if you want to use that

02:38:56   14   technology, you have to license that technology.            You have

02:38:59   15   to pay for that technology.       And then it's fair.

02:39:03   16            You'll hear expert testimony in this case from our

02:39:07   17   expert -- technical expert, Joseph McAlexander of

02:39:12   18   McAlexander Sound in Richardson, Texas.          Many, many years

02:39:15   19   of audio processing experience.

02:39:17   20            He will offer his expert opinions with respect to

02:39:19   21   how the Amazon Echo products meet each and every element of

02:39:25   22   the asserted method claims when they are used, but -- the

02:39:28   23   microphone array, the sound source localization unit, the

02:39:32   24   adaptive beamforming unit, the noise reduction unit, all in

02:39:36   25   a single digital processor.

                                                                                     167



02:39:37    1            Now, Amazon denies infringement.          You've heard

02:39:40    2   that.   You heard that from the moment that selection began

02:39:43    3   this morning.

02:39:44    4            I want to show you, however, some snippets of

02:39:48    5   evidence that you'll see during this trial.           I don't want

02:39:51    6   you to just listen to my words.        I want you to see snippets

02:39:56    7   of evidence.

02:39:56    8            So Amazon says they don't do sound source

02:40:00    9   localization.    That's one of the elements.         But here's an

02:40:03   10   Amazon document prepared before the lawsuit, not in answer

02:40:06   11   to the lawsuit, which indicates they're locating the source

02:40:09   12   of speech.

02:40:10   13            Here's another Amazon document written by Amazon

02:40:13   14   witnesses, some of whom will testify in this case, stating

02:40:21   15   expressly that the Echo devices have sound source

02:40:29   16   localization algorithms.

02:40:30   17            They say they don't do adaptive beamforming, but

02:40:30   18   their own documents, their technical documents say they do

02:40:34   19   adaptive beamforming.      See the ABF in the middle, well,

02:40:39   20   that's defined in the same document as adaptive

02:40:41   21   beamforming.    And you'll hear from our expert witness as to

02:40:44   22   exactly how this is used.

02:40:45   23            Also, beamforming, you can see right on almost

02:40:48   24   every one of these forms, it's there.         This is evidence

02:40:52   25   created years ago, before there was any lawsuit.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 43 of 156 PageID #: 18504
                                                                                     168



02:40:55    1            Amazon says they don't determine a delay.            But

02:41:01    2   look first and last on the circle.         That is the

02:41:03    3   determination of the delay, the delay between microphones,

02:41:08    4   the sensors.     Their own documents establish it.

02:41:10    5            Amazon, of course, can't deny they use a circular

02:41:14    6   array because their Echo and their DOT are circular.

02:41:18    7            Amazon concedes that it knows of the '049 patent

02:41:20    8   by at least the date of the filing of the complaint.

02:41:24    9            But you will see much evidence that they knew

02:41:26   10   about this patent years ago, where they were so willfully

02:41:29   11   blind to its existence by closing their eyes that they

02:41:33   12   should be held accountable.

02:41:38   13            And Amazon, of course, knows and intends that its

02:41:40   14   customers use the Echo devices.        So they fit within the

02:41:45   15   boundary.

02:41:45   16            Now, this is, to me, the most telling part of our

02:41:48   17   case.   Amazon went out into the world in 2011, as you will

02:41:52   18   hear from witnesses, and started to invite companies, small

02:41:55   19   companies, who had a reputation for technology, to come in

02:41:58   20   and demonstrate their technology.

02:42:00   21            And they had a pattern of meeting with these

02:42:03   22   companies.     Here's an Amazon document from April of 2011

02:42:07   23   talking about their meetings with two of these speech

02:42:11   24   recognition companies.      Their own evidence from 2011.

02:42:13   25            Here are a list of witnesses in this case, who you

                                                                                     169



02:42:17    1   will hear from, all of whom say that Amazon had a corporate

02:42:23    2   policy to tell its engineers, don't look at patents if

02:42:27    3   people bring patents to your attention.          Close your eyes.

02:42:32    4   Corporate policy, deliberate -- deliberately ignore those

02:42:36    5   patents.     Corporate policy.

02:42:38    6              And then, of course, Amazon invited Dr. Li to

02:42:43    7   present his technology, which was already the subject of

02:42:46    8   pending patent applications, to them in California at their

02:42:51    9   famous Lab 126.

02:42:52   10              And here's a timeline of the evidence.         The first

02:42:55   11   application provisional was filed in September of 2010.

02:43:00   12   Dr. Li takes his prototype technology to the CES show, a

02:43:09   13   famous show in Las Vegas, Nevada, in January of '11.

02:43:09   14   Here's the prototype that he took there.          It was not a

02:43:11   15   working prototype, but it demonstrated the technology, and

02:43:12   16   he took it places and demonstrated the technology.            He

02:43:15   17   didn't offer this for sale.

02:43:17   18              But after that show, by the way, where he won an

02:43:20   19   award for designing and engineering -- I'll go back for a

02:43:25   20   second and you can see the award in the top left-hand

02:43:28   21   corner -- he's invited by Amazon to come to the lab.

02:43:32   22              And here's the actual original email from Jerry Wu

02:43:37   23   at Amazon.     Come to the lab, show us your technology, show

02:43:41   24   us adaptive beamforming, which they now say they don't do.

02:43:44   25              And what did Dr. Li do?      He said, of course, I'll
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 45 of 156 PageID #: 18506
                                                                                     170



02:43:47    1   come, and he signed a nondisclosure agreement with them.

02:43:50    2              And what does that nondisclosure agreement say?

02:43:53    3   It says:    The receiving party may use confidential

02:43:55    4   information only in pursuance of the business relationship

02:44:00    5   with the disclosing party.

02:44:01    6              But they're using that information, and they've

02:44:04    7   never done business with him, and they've never paid him a

02:44:07    8   penny.

02:44:07    9              And look at the next paragraph, Paragraph 6:           All

02:44:11   10   confidential information will remain the exclusive property

02:44:14   11   of the disclosing party.

02:44:16   12              Not true.

02:44:17   13              And so what happened?     Dr. Li went to the meeting,

02:44:23   14   and he wrote them, and he said, here's what I'm going to

02:44:27   15   demonstrate for you at the meeting, microphone array, noise

02:44:31   16   reduction, echo cancellation.       And then down at the bottom,

02:44:36   17   real-time demos of echo cancellation and sound source

02:44:42   18   localization.    And that's what he did.

02:44:43   19              And then he gets an email soon before his meeting

02:44:45   20   from Wei Li, an Amazon engineer working, unbeknownst to

02:44:50   21   Dr. Li -- working on the Echo development.           By the way,

02:44:51   22   Amazon never told Dr. Li there was any Echo development.

02:44:54   23   They hid that from all of the companies who came in.

02:44:57   24              What does Wei Li write?      I'm glad you're coming to

02:45:01   25   showcase your technology.       I also recommended your

                                                                                     171



02:45:03    1   technology to my team.      They're quite interested.

02:45:06    2            Why does Amazon need Dr. Li and Li Creative

02:45:10    3   Technologies and these other companies to go out to

02:45:12    4   California and teach them sound source localization,

02:45:17    5   adaptive beamforming, why do they need that if this is

02:45:21    6   obvious, if this is so easy?       And then, of course, Dr. Li

02:45:25    7   had pending patent applications.

02:45:26    8            And here's the type -- I've just shown you --

02:45:31    9   you'll hear this later today -- the demonstration that he

02:45:35   10   gave to them.     He demonstrated all of these things, and he

02:45:38   11   told them he had 13 filed and two issued patents in his

02:45:44   12   written demonstration.      And he taught them echo

02:45:48   13   cancellation and sound source localization.

02:45:51   14            And after the meeting, believe it or not, he said

02:45:54   15   can we have all of that in writing, we like your

02:45:57   16   technology?     He said, sure.    And he sent it to them.        These

02:46:00   17   are premarked exhibits.      This is evidence in this case.

02:46:03   18   This isn't lawyers talking.       It's evidence.

02:46:05   19            And then the patent application was published on

02:46:11   20   March 29, 2012.     And on October 14, 2014, it issued, an

02:46:18   21   issued patent.

02:46:19   22            And look what happens next.        Echo launches on

02:46:22   23   approximately November 20, 2014, and Amazon had a big

02:46:26   24   launch party in New York City to celebrate the Echo.             And

02:46:30   25   guess who they invited, Dr. Li, believe it or not, and he
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 47 of 156 PageID #: 18508
                                                                                     172



02:46:33    1   goes with Manli Zhu, his co-inventor, to the party, and

02:46:36    2   they -- they don't know what Echo is.         They've never heard

02:46:39    3   of Echo.

02:46:39    4              They go to the party, and they demonstrate the

02:46:42    5   Echo device that you saw, and he looked at Dr. Manli Zhu

02:46:46    6   and said, that's our invention.        That's what we

02:46:48    7   demonstrated to them.      We can't believe it.

02:46:52    8              Then they talked to the engineers at that meeting,

02:46:54    9   and they confirmed that it had each and every one of those

02:46:58   10   elements of the claim.

02:47:00   11              Did he make a scene at the meeting?        No.    But what

02:47:04   12   did he do?    Within a short week or two, he writes a letter

02:47:08   13   to the head of the Echo project, and he says:           I don't know

02:47:11   14   if you know this, because you weren't at that presentation

02:47:14   15   three years ago, but here's what I presented, and I gave

02:47:17   16   you my files, and I gave you everything, and I went to the

02:47:21   17   event today, and I saw what happened.         I think we better

02:47:24   18   sit down and have a meeting.       A collaboration would be the

02:47:28   19   best way to resolve this.

02:47:29   20              But did he say, I'm going to sue you for patent

02:47:32   21   infringement?    No.   He's a businessman.       He's an engineer.

02:47:37   22   He's not a lawyer.     He didn't threaten them.

02:47:39   23              But when you read this, and you'll be able to take

02:47:42   24   this back into the jury room at the end of the trial,

02:47:45   25   you'll see that he was saying to them, we have a real

                                                                                     173



02:47:48    1   problem here.

02:47:49    2              And you know what Amazon did?       They never

02:47:51    3   responded to that letter, never talked to him again, zero,

02:47:55    4   until the day that Dr. Li sued them for patent infringement

02:47:57    5   in 2019.

02:47:58    6              Damages.   I just want to talk briefly.        As you

02:48:05    7   heard His Honor say, if you believe there's patent

02:48:07    8   infringement, then the Plaintiff would be entitled to not

02:48:10    9   less than a reasonable royalty.

02:48:12   10              You will hear Amazon say, because their damages

02:48:15   11   expert is going to tell you this, the damages can't be more

02:48:19   12   than $700,000.00 because there was a time in 2015 when

02:48:23   13   Dr. Li offered to sell Google the '756 patent, not the '049

02:48:27   14   that's in suit, the '756 patent, for $700,000.00, and that

02:48:32   15   they turned him down.

02:48:33   16              But what you'll hear is, that's not the truth.

02:48:35   17   The truth is there was a deal on Google where you could

02:48:39   18   make a proposal for a sale of the patent, but you still had

02:48:44   19   to learn what the terms were.       You still had to negotiate

02:48:47   20   the terms.     You still had to sign documents.

02:48:50   21              He did none of that.     And it wasn't the '7 -- the

02:48:54   22   '049 patent at all, and Amazon -- nobody had a successful

02:48:57   23   product.     This was six months after the launch of Amazon.

02:49:00   24   But their expert will tell you that the whole thing is

02:49:04   25   $700,000.00.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 49 of 156 PageID #: 18510
                                                                                     174



02:49:05    1            And I believe at the end of this trial you'll see

02:49:07    2   that the damages are much more substantial.           You know

02:49:10    3   what's happened, is Amazon has become a huge seller of the

02:49:14    4   Echo device.

02:49:14    5            Our expert, Alan Ratliff, looks at the economic

02:49:18    6   value to Amazon, and he looks at something called the

02:49:21    7   downstream economic value, which is an Amazon number.             It's

02:49:24    8   their downstream economic value.

02:49:26    9            And at the end of his analysis, and you'll hear

02:49:29   10   from him, he determines that the price per unit should be

02:49:33   11   between $1.32 and $1.65 royalty per unit.

02:49:43   12            Okay.   But they've sold 19 million units since

02:49:46   13   this complaint was filed in April of '19.          So it adds up to

02:49:49   14   a range between $25 million and $31 million.

02:49:53   15            And is that a lot of money?        You bet it's a lot of

02:49:56   16   money, but he came up with the invention, and he spent the

02:50:00   17   time and money to get the patent, and he got the patent,

02:50:03   18   and he demonstrated the technology, and he signed an NDA,

02:50:09   19   and they owe him the money.

02:50:10   20            They also claim that there's prior art which

02:50:15   21   invalidates the patent.      And you heard from the preliminary

02:50:19   22   instructions that to invalidate a patent, Amazon has the

02:50:22   23   burden to show by clear and convincing evidence, not

02:50:24   24   preponderance, clear and convincing evidence, a heavy

02:50:29   25   burden, that this patent is invalid.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 50 of 156 PageID #: 18511
                                                                                     175



02:50:30    1            Well, you will see when you look at their evidence

02:50:33    2   that it's not even close to meeting any burden.

02:50:37    3            For example, they say that one of Dr. Li's own

02:50:43    4   articles from 2009 on his old microphone, which had nothing

02:50:50    5   to do with the new technology, they say that's invalidating

02:50:54    6   prior art, that this jury should consider it and invalidate

02:50:58    7   it.

02:50:58    8            But look what the Patent Office said in 2019 or

02:51:02    9   2020 in a subsequent application in a different patent

02:51:05   10   application involving the same technology when they looked

02:51:06   11   at the Li article.     The examiner said he agrees that, in

02:51:10   12   considering Li alone, Li does not disclose a sound source

02:51:15   13   localization unit which estimates a location of said target

02:51:19   14   sound signal.

02:51:19   15            And the Patent Office allowed these new claims

02:51:22   16   over the Li article.     But they're going to ask you, the

02:51:26   17   jury, to say that that Li article invalidates this patent.

02:51:30   18            THE COURT:    Five minutes remaining.

02:51:32   19            MR. FABRICANT:     Thank you, Your Honor.

02:51:32   20            They have cobbled together a number of items which

02:51:40   21   they would ask the jury to -- to find at the end of the

02:51:43   22   trial proves by clear and convincing evidence that the

02:51:48   23   patent is invalid.

02:51:48   24            You will see how weak their non-infringement

02:51:51   25   defense is because we have the documents and the evidence
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 51 of 156 PageID #: 18512
                                                                                     176



02:51:54    1   and the source code and the witnesses to demonstrate that

02:51:57    2   they clearly infringe.

02:51:58    3            So, of course, their entire case is really, can we

02:52:02    4   invalidate the patent?      And that's where they will spend

02:52:05    5   their time and effort.

02:52:06    6            So they've put forward the Li article, they've

02:52:09    7   raised -- they've pulled out a textbook called the

02:52:13    8   Brandstein textbook, and they're arguing that the articles

02:52:18    9   in that textbook are invalidating prior art.

02:52:20   10            And then, finally, finally, the last thing they

02:52:23   11   will urge is there was this new patent application that was

02:52:26   12   filed -- it was another reissue of that old 70 -- '756, not

02:52:32   13   a reissue of the patent-in-suit, a reissue of the old '756.

02:52:36   14            And they're arguing that because of that reissue,

02:52:40   15   there's a statement in there that they will tell you, in

02:52:42   16   their opinion, in their view, that this constitutes -- it's

02:52:47   17   somehow an admission that the '049 patent is invalid.

02:52:51   18            But all this is was an attempt to get additional

02:52:55   19   claims on the '756 patent.

02:52:56   20            If you look at the highlighted portion in the

02:52:59   21   first paragraph, they're broadening Claim 1 of the parent

02:53:05   22   application, '756 is broadened as explained in the attached

02:53:10   23   sheet.   And then when you go to the attached sheet, it

02:53:14   24   explains that this is a broadening reissue.

02:53:18   25            Dr. Li never said the patent was invalid,

                                                                                     177



02:53:21    1   Dr. Manli Zhu, who signed this application, never said the

02:53:24    2   patent was invalid.

02:53:25    3            And we believe strongly that you will not find by

02:53:28    4   clear and convincing evidence that any of this constitutes

02:53:32    5   patent invalidity.

02:53:33    6            So at the end of the trial, we're going to have a

02:53:44    7   closing argument, and I'm going to revisit these issues of

02:53:47    8   infringement, and I'm also going to ask you to find willful

02:53:50    9   infringement.

02:53:51   10            Now, that's something different from infringement.

02:53:53   11   To find infringement, it doesn't have to be willful.             It

02:53:56   12   can be innocent, and they'd still be liable for damages, if

02:53:59   13   you find out their infringement was innocent.

02:54:03   14            But when it's willful, it's -- it means

02:54:06   15   intentional.    It means they knew or should have known,

02:54:10   16   willfully blind to the fact that they were practicing this

02:54:13   17   invention.

02:54:13   18            So I will ask you to find, not only that it was

02:54:17   19   infringed, but that it was willfully infringed.            So I'll

02:54:20   20   ask you to check the first box yes -- yes.

02:54:22   21            And then for patent invalidity, we'll ask you to

02:54:25   22   find, no, the patents are not invalid.

02:54:27   23            THE COURT:    Two minutes remaining.

02:54:28   24            MR. FABRICANT:     Thank you, Your Honor.

02:54:31   25            And then, finally, after the damages analysis is

02:54:37    1   performed by our expert, and you'll hear, of course, the

02:54:37    2   damages testimony of their expert, you'll hear the

02:54:40    3   technical experts' opinions for the Amazon company, but we

02:54:42    4   will ask you to find that, for the time of the infringement

02:54:47    5   up through the date of trial, for the -- for the actual

02:54:50    6   units sold, multiplied by the number of units that were

02:54:53    7   actually sold per unit, the reasonable royalty, the

02:54:58    8   reasonable compensation for Vocalife, for Dr. Li should be

02:55:02    9   in the amount of $31 million.

02:55:03   10              Thank you very much.      We greatly appreciate your

02:55:07   11   service.

02:55:09   12              Thank you, Your Honor.

02:55:11   13              THE COURT:   All right.     Defendants may now present

02:55:14   14   their opening statement to the jury.

02:55:16   15              Mr. Dacus, would you like a warning on your time?

02:55:19   16              MR. DACUS:   Yes, Your Honor, if you would give me

02:55:21   17   a five minute and two minute also, that would be greatly

02:55:24   18   appreciated.

02:55:25   19              THE COURT:   I will certainly do that.        You may

02:55:27   20   proceed when you're ready.

02:55:29   21              MR. DACUS:   Thank you very much.

02:55:30   22              Good afternoon.    By way of reintroduction, I'm

02:55:36   23   Deron Dacus.    And you met Phil Hilmes from Amazon this

02:55:45   24   morning.    You met Dave Hadden.      But I want to introduce you

02:55:45   25   to two folks you didn't meet this morning who are part of
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 54 of 156 PageID #: 18515
                                                                                     179



02:55:46    1   our team and you'll hear from during the trial.            This is

02:55:46    2   Joe Re and Alan Laquer, and you'll hear from both of them

02:55:55    3   during the trial.

02:55:56    4             Now, I want to start this afternoon where we

02:55:59    5   started this morning, and that is to say to you a very

02:56:00    6   sincere thanks for being willing to serve on a jury.             These

02:56:03    7   are difficult times.

02:56:05    8             As I told you this morning, we would not be

02:56:07    9   here -- Amazon would not be here if this case was not very

02:56:11   10   important to Amazon.     It is very important to Amazon.

02:56:13   11             You may be thinking that because Amazon has been

02:56:19   12   sued on patent infringement, that Amazon is mad at the

02:56:22   13   patent system or that Amazon does not respect the patent

02:56:25   14   system.    And I know the men and women who work at Amazon

02:56:28   15   want me to say to you, nothing could be further from the

02:56:31   16   truth.    Nothing could be further from the truth.

02:56:34   17             Amazon itself has thousands of patents to protect

02:56:38   18   its technology, but not every piece of technology that

02:56:42   19   Amazon uses or makes is worthy of a -- being patented.               And

02:56:47   20   that's -- that's certainly true in this case.

02:56:49   21             Now, from Amazon's perspective, this case involves

02:56:53   22   principles that are absolutely fundamental -- absolutely

02:56:57   23   fundamental to our United States patent system and the jury

02:57:01   24   system that underlies it.       And that's -- that's ultimately

02:57:04   25   why they're here.

                                                                                     180



02:57:05    1            Now, when you heard about this patent system on

02:57:08    2   the Court's video this morning, you got a lot of

02:57:11    3   information.   But one thing you heard is our patent system,

02:57:14    4   although the greatest in the world, is not perfect.             And

02:57:18    5   when someone accuses you wrongly or falsely of using or

02:57:23    6   infringing their patent, where you come to defend yourself

02:57:28    7   is in front of eight folks in a Federal District Court.

02:57:31    8   And that's why we're here.

02:57:32    9            You also heard that the jury makes the ultimate

02:57:35   10   determination on the validity of a patent, and that's also

02:57:41   11   why we're here, to have you help us and answer both of

02:57:46   12   those two constitutional questions.

02:57:48   13            Now, you heard some preliminary instructions from

02:57:50   14   the Court a minute ago.      And one thing that he instructed

02:57:54   15   you on is you're going to have to make determinations on

02:57:57   16   credibility and believability as you go through this case.

02:58:00   17            And I will say to you very candidly, having now

02:58:03   18   heard what the Plaintiffs just said to you over the last 30

02:58:05   19   minutes, you're going to hear two very different versions

02:58:09   20   of the facts in this case.

02:58:10   21            I think that's -- that's a certainty.           You're

02:58:14   22   going to have to use, exactly as the Judge told you, your

02:58:18   23   common sense, the things you use in everyday life, to

02:58:22   24   determine what the believable story is, what makes sense to

02:58:26   25   you, and that's going to be a critical part of this case.

                                                                                     181



02:58:30    1            Now, who are the parties in this case?           Who are

02:58:35    2   these folks that you need to determine the facts about?

02:58:39    3            You heard this morning and you heard the opening

02:58:42    4   statement now, related to Vocalife, and you heard a lot of

02:58:44    5   facts.   I'm not going to take my time now to say to you

02:58:48    6   some of the facts I think you did not hear and some of the

02:58:52    7   facts that I think you may hear differently as the case

02:58:54    8   goes on, but here's what I'm going to ask you to do.             And,

02:58:58    9   that is, I want you to imprint in your mind and remember

02:59:02   10   very vividly what you were told both this morning and in

02:59:06   11   the last 30 minutes.     And I want you to compare it to what

02:59:09   12   you hear from the witness stand ultimately from Vocalife.

02:59:12   13            Now, of course, at this table sits Amazon.            And we

02:59:15   14   know from jury selection and questionnaires that many of

02:59:18   15   you, maybe all of you, know who Amazon is today.            But you

02:59:22   16   may not know where it came from.

02:59:25   17            I mean, Amazon literally was started in 1994 in

02:59:29   18   the garage of this house.       The founder had two computers,

02:59:33   19   and he had, at the time, what was a very strange idea.

02:59:38   20   And, that is, to sell books, and at that time only books,

02:59:42   21   on this very new-fangled thing that people didn't know much

02:59:47   22   about called the Internet.

02:59:49   23            Believe it or not, if you have enough gray hair

02:59:51   24   like I do, you remember a time before the Internet.             If you

02:59:54   25   don't have quite as much gray hair, you may think it's been
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 57 of 156 PageID #: 18518
                                                                                     182



03:00:00    1   around forever.

03:00:01    2            But that was a very novel idea in 1994, to sell

03:00:04    3   books over the Internet.

03:00:05    4            The founder did that, was very successful, and the

03:00:08    5   rest, in some respects, is history.

03:00:10    6            What you see here is a timeline, sort of the

03:00:13    7   evolution of Amazon and where it's gone from its founding

03:00:16    8   in 1994, at least through 2014, and the various pieces of

03:00:23    9   technology that Amazon has been instrumental in creating.

03:00:28   10            And they didn't do it on the backs of folks like

03:00:32   11   Vocalife.   They did it on the backs of hard work, hiring

03:00:35   12   the best and brightest engineers and scientists in the

03:00:37   13   United States.     And, frankly, in many ways, of following

03:00:43   14   their philosophy of putting the customer first.

03:00:45   15            Now, most importantly on this timeline is this

03:00:50   16   date of November 2014.      That's the date that these Echo

03:00:54   17   devices were launched.      And these Echo devices use a --

03:00:59   18   what's called an intelligent voice system called Alexa.

03:01:05   19            And, essentially, what Alexa is -- you heard some

03:01:08   20   discussion about it this morning in our jury selection.                It

03:01:12   21   operates almost like the human brain.         You can talk to

03:01:16   22   these Echos.     And through Alexa, she can talk back to you.

03:01:23   23            So Alexa can actually understand what you say.             As

03:01:27   24   some example, you can say, "Alexa, tell me the news."             It

03:01:30   25   would tell you the news.      "Alexa, what's the weather?"         It

                                                                                     183



03:01:34    1   would tell you the weather.       This list could be hundreds of

03:01:37    2   thousands of things long.

03:01:39    3            I'll give you just one example very simplified

03:01:41    4   here.

03:01:42    5            (Videoclip played.)

03:01:43    6            MR. DACUS:    The Echo and Alexa, I want you to

03:01:54    7   understand this, was created over years of work at Amazon

03:01:58    8   by literally thousands of scientists and engineers.             And

03:02:02    9   when I say thousands, that's not an overstatement.            That's

03:02:05   10   not an embellishment.      That's literally what it required

03:02:10   11   both to develop the Amazon Echo and Alexa and to continue

03:02:14   12   to develop it.

03:02:16   13            I want to take just a few minutes to give you an

03:02:19   14   overview of how the Echo and Alexa work together.

03:02:24   15            So let's just assume that you lived in Dallas.

03:02:28   16   Thankfully, we don't have to, but assume that you did.                And

03:02:32   17   assume that you had an Echo.       Here's how it would work.

03:02:36   18            If you had an Echo in your house and you said to

03:02:38   19   your Echo, "Alexa" -- which causes the device to wake up --

03:02:44   20   "play the Beatles," it would digitize your speech, send it

03:02:53   21   over the Internet to a computer or data center that is

03:02:55   22   owned by Amazon, one of their thousands of computers, and

03:02:56   23   then the hard work of Alexa would then begin.           And for

03:03:04   24   someone like me who's not technical, this -- this is

03:03:06   25   fascinating stuff.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 59 of 156 PageID #: 18520
                                                                                     184



03:03:07    1             So Alexa will -- of course, has to determine what

03:03:15    2   was said to that Echo.      So it, through automatic speech

03:03:19    3   recognition, will identify the actual words that were

03:03:22    4   spoken.

03:03:22    5             Then once it identifies the words, "play the

03:03:25    6   Beatles," it will have to actually understand or interpret

03:03:30    7   those words.   And it does that through something called

03:03:33    8   natural language understanding.

03:03:35    9             And natural language understanding involves

03:03:38   10   artificial intelligence, machine learning, these things

03:03:43   11   they call -- that Amazon calls neural networks, which

03:03:45   12   basically mimic the neurons in your brain.

03:03:48   13             And, for example, here, Alexa would have to

03:03:52   14   determine when you say, "play the Beatles," are you asking

03:03:55   15   it to mimic the sound of the insect the beetles, are you

03:03:59   16   asking it to play music, are you asking it to play the

03:04:04   17   movie Beetlejuice?     What are you asking it to do?

03:04:09   18             So through artificial intelligence, it can

03:04:13   19   actually understand just like we can as humans.            And once

03:04:15   20   it does, it passes that along to what Amazon calls skills.

03:04:20   21   And that's -- the skills are actually intended to

03:04:22   22   accomplish what you ask for.

03:04:23   23             In this case, you ask for music.         So Amazon will

03:04:26   24   reach out to a third party in this case, a website that

03:04:31   25   supplies the music.     The music is transferred to your Echo

                                                                                     185



03:04:36    1   in Dallas, and the music is played on your Echo.

03:04:39    2            All of that, of course, happens in a split second.

03:04:43    3   It took me several minutes to explain it, but it happens in

03:04:46    4   a split second.

03:04:47    5            And, of course, an important part of that is the

03:04:49    6   Echo itself because the Echo has to always be waiting to

03:04:52    7   hear what's known as the wake-up word, which is Alexa --

03:04:57    8   the name "Alexa."     And it has to hear that word in order to

03:05:01    9   transmit the digitized recording to the -- to the Alexa

03:05:07   10   Cloud.

03:05:07   11            So let's talk about these Echos and a little bit

03:05:10   12   of the mechanics of them.

03:05:13   13            This is one of the Echos.        This is a cross section

03:05:17   14   of what it looks like on the inside.         And this is the part

03:05:20   15   that's important for this case.

03:05:22   16            If you see those seven green circles, those are

03:05:27   17   six microphones on the outside periphery of the Echo and

03:05:32   18   one on the inside.     Those microphones are always waiting

03:05:36   19   for the wake-up word.      You'll hear that a lot.        The wake

03:05:43   20   word "Alexa" to be spoken.

03:05:47   21            But what's important for this case is, each of

03:05:50   22   those -- those microphones, there are six predefined beams

03:05:55   23   that are formed.     They are preprogrammed into the Echo at

03:06:00   24   the time it's made.     And they're listening in all these

03:06:04   25   directions for this wake-up word to be spoken.

                                                                                     186



03:06:08    1            And when it is spoken, of course, Alexa wakes -- I

03:06:13    2   mean, the Echo wakes up, transmits the information to the

03:06:18    3   Alexa Cloud.

03:06:19    4            But the important part and the part I want you to

03:06:21    5   remember that you'll hear a lot about is that these beams

03:06:24    6   that are listening are predefined and preprogrammed.             And

03:06:29    7   why do I say that's important?        Because let's talk about

03:06:32    8   how the '049 patent works.

03:06:35    9            You've been told that the Echo works the same as

03:06:37   10   the '049.   So let's talk at a high level whether or not

03:06:39   11   that's accurate.

03:06:40   12            So the '049 patent, rather than having predefined,

03:06:47   13   preprogrammed beams, this patent actually listens for the

03:06:51   14   voice first without pre -- predefined or preformed beams.

03:06:59   15            And then once it hears a voice, it goes through a

03:07:04   16   series of mathematical calculations, very complicated

03:07:09   17   mathematical calculations involving trigonometry, geometry,

03:07:16   18   something called an azimuth angle, what the patent calls

03:07:19   19   delays, and then it forms the beam.

03:07:22   20            So think about how the Echo works with predefined

03:07:26   21   beams.   This beam is formed only after these mathematical

03:07:30   22   calculations.    And only then after the mathematical

03:07:35   23   calculations, does it listen for the voice.           Very different

03:07:38   24   than how Amazon does it.      And Amazon does it the way it

03:07:42   25   does primarily because it's important that the Echo always

                                                                                     187



03:07:46    1   be there available and instantly ready to hear that wake-up

03:07:51    2   word of "Alexa."

03:07:52    3            Now, let's talk about how you're going to go about

03:07:57    4   determining infringement or use of this patent in this

03:08:00    5   case.

03:08:00    6            The Judge has given you some instructions on this.

03:08:05    7   You heard some on the video.       But I'm confident that before

03:08:08    8   you came in here this morning, you had probably never done

03:08:11    9   an infringement analysis.       You had probably never compared

03:08:17   10   a product to a patent to determine if there was

03:08:20   11   infringement.    So I know a lot of this today has been

03:08:23   12   drinking -- like drinking water through a fire hose.

03:08:27   13            So I think it's appropriate to slow down and make

03:08:29   14   sure that we all understand the process.          And here's why I

03:08:34   15   think it's important to do this.        It's not our job as

03:08:36   16   lawyers just to tell you the answer that we don't infringe.

03:08:39   17   Our job as lawyers is to give you the evidence so that you

03:08:43   18   can make an informed decision when the Judge asks you the

03:08:47   19   question.

03:08:47   20            And I think ultimately the Judge will instruct you

03:08:51   21   that a patent is infringed only if the accused product,

03:08:54   22   that's the Echo, includes each and every element in the

03:08:57   23   patent claim.

03:08:57   24            So what does that mean?        You remember the Judge

03:08:59   25   told you a minute ago that when you turn to the back of the
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 63 of 156 PageID #: 18524
                                                                                     188



03:09:04    1   '049 patent in your notebook, which you can do when you

03:09:06    2   have some time -- I'm not asking you to do it now -- you

03:09:09    3   will see claims.     And they're numbered.       It's the last

03:09:14    4   section.

03:09:15    5              And each of that -- those claims contain a lot of

03:09:18    6   words.     And those words define the invention.        They define,

03:09:22    7   so to speak, the -- the fence around the property.

03:09:26    8              And so each and every element in that claim has to

03:09:30    9   be found in the Echo.

03:09:32   10              I'll give you one simple example to hopefully help

03:09:39   11   explain this.     And I'll make a confession to you that I

03:09:42   12   practiced law for about 10 years before I started doing

03:09:45   13   patent cases, and I was trying to figure out exactly how

03:09:48   14   this infringement analysis was to go, and somebody gave me

03:09:54   15   this example and it made sense to me, and that's why I

03:09:55   16   offer it to you.

03:09:56   17              Let's assume that someone had a patent on a soccer

03:10:00   18   ball, and the patent said, it's made of leather, stitched

03:10:04   19   together, filled with air, and round in shape.            And let's

03:10:07   20   assume that that patent owner sued the maker of a football.

03:10:11   21              So what the jury would do in that case is the jury

03:10:14   22   would say, well, the football is made of leather, it's

03:10:17   23   stitched together, it's filled with air, but it's oblong in

03:10:22   24   shape, it's not round in shape.        And, therefore, there's

03:10:25   25   not infringement.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 64 of 156 PageID #: 18525
                                                                                     189



03:10:26    1             And that's what I think the Court has instructed

03:10:29    2   you and will instruct you, that if every single element or

03:10:33    3   every single subpart of that patent is not met, then there

03:10:37    4   is no infringement.     And it makes sense, right?         A football

03:10:40    5   is very different from a soccer ball.

03:10:42    6             So how do you take those principles and apply them

03:10:45    7   to the patent in this case?       So what you see in yellow

03:10:48    8   highlighted in front of you is Claim 1 from the '049

03:10:50    9   patent.

03:10:51   10             Now, you may remember that this is something that

03:10:53   11   Vocalife's lawyer just showed you was Claim 1.            And you may

03:10:57   12   be saying, well, this is a lot longer than what he showed

03:11:00   13   us.   And it's true.    He didn't -- he didn't show you all of

03:11:04   14   it.   I don't know why, but he didn't show you all of the

03:11:07   15   claim.

03:11:08   16             So what you have to determine is, are all of these

03:11:10   17   phrases, all of these words in this claim met?

03:11:14   18             So here it is blown up.       And what I want to do is

03:11:18   19   just give you a roadmap, a little bit of a preview of what

03:11:22   20   I think you will hear from the witness stand, you'll

03:11:24   21   certainly hear more than what I'm able to give you now.

03:11:28   22             In the comparison of this Echo product to this

03:11:32   23   '049 patent.   And I'll tell you those letters (a) through

03:11:34   24   (f) there on the side in parentheses, those aren't in the

03:11:38   25   patent.   We wrote those in here to break this language down
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 65 of 156 PageID #: 18526
                                                                                     190



03:11:41    1   because there's a lot of words so that we can identify each

03:11:44    2   subparagraph or element and talk about it so that it

03:11:47    3   hopefully makes a little more sense.

03:11:54    4            Let me give you one example of what I think you'll

03:11:57    5   hear from the witness stand.

03:11:59    6            Amazon will bring Dr. Sayfe Kiaei, who is one of

03:12:05    7   the world's leading acoustic processing experts, and he

03:12:05    8   will testify to you in great detail, probably more detail

03:12:11    9   than you ever wanted, probably more detail than I ever

03:12:14   10   wanted, but the kind of detail that you need to make an

03:12:18   11   informed decision in comparing the patent language to the

03:12:22   12   Echo.

03:12:23   13            So one thing he will say to you is, if you look at

03:12:25   14   this subparagraph or element that we've labeled (c), where

03:12:33   15   it says "determining a delay" -- let me pause and say this,

03:12:35   16   for those of you who are going to take notes, and the Judge

03:12:38   17   says it's not required, what I would suggest to you is or

03:12:42   18   recommend, when Dr. Kiaei takes the stand if you want to

03:12:45   19   open up your notebook, turn to Claim 1 of the '049 or

03:12:49   20   whatever claim he's talking about, you can follow along

03:12:52   21   with him.

03:12:53   22            And what he's going to show you and what the

03:12:56   23   evidence will show you, both from he and from those who

03:13:00   24   testify from Amazon, is that this Element (c), this is the

03:13:08   25   part of the patent where I talked about at a high level
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 66 of 156 PageID #: 18527
                                                                                     191



03:13:11    1   earlier where you have to calculate this delay through

03:13:15    2   these mathematical calculations in order if you look at

03:13:17    3   the -- the bottom sentence, there to determine those -- to

03:13:21    4   make a determination of said delay in order to form a beam.

03:13:26    5   So these are the calculations that are made before the beam

03:13:29    6   is formed in order to form the beam.

03:13:31    7            And what you'll find out from the evidence is

03:13:34    8   that's not how Amazon does it.        Amazon has these

03:13:38    9   predefined, predetermined beams already in place.

03:13:42   10            And so if you're following along in your notes,

03:13:46   11   and Dr. Kiaei convinces you that, in fact, we don't do it

03:13:48   12   that way, you can just put a little X out beside there.

03:13:53   13   And when you go into the jury room, you'll know from your

03:13:56   14   notes that, in fact, this element or limitation was not

03:14:01   15   met.

03:14:02   16            I'll give you one more example before I move on.

03:14:05   17            There's a step in the patent called performing

03:14:07   18   adaptive beamforming for steering a directivity pattern of

03:14:10   19   said array.

03:14:10   20            This is simply focusing the beam in a certain

03:14:16   21   direction after those mathematical calculations are made.

03:14:20   22            And, again, because Amazon's Echo has predefined,

03:14:24   23   preprogrammed beams, we don't do it in this fashion.             We

03:14:29   24   simply do it differently.       And because of that, we don't

03:14:32   25   use the '049 invention.      We don't infringe their patent.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 67 of 156 PageID #: 18528
                                                                                     192



03:14:36    1            Now, I want to talk about the second question that

03:14:41    2   you're going to be asked, and, that is, whether or not this

03:14:47    3   patent is invalid.

03:14:48    4            You remember from what the Judge said to you this

03:14:51    5   afternoon and what -- the video this morning, patents are

03:14:54    6   supposed to be new.     They're supposed to be something that

03:14:56    7   did not exist in the public before the patent was filed.

03:15:00    8            And here, the evidence is going to show you that,

03:15:05    9   in fact, the information in this patent existed before the

03:15:09   10   filing date of 2009.

03:15:15   11            Here's a couple of reasons we know that.            And I'll

03:15:17   12   tell you, Dr. Richard Stern, another one of the country's

03:15:22   13   leading experts, is going to testify to you about

03:15:24   14   invalidity.   And, again, you should open up the patent and

03:15:27   15   follow along with him as he does.

03:15:30   16            But the reason we know this information in the

03:15:32   17   patent application existed in the public before is for a

03:15:36   18   couple of reasons.

03:15:37   19            In 2009, Dr. Li wrote an article, and it was an

03:15:43   20   article about microphone arrays and speech recognition.

03:15:46   21   And in that article, in the back, he cited, meaning he

03:15:50   22   named, sources that he had looked at.         And one of those

03:15:53   23   sources is this textbook right here.

03:15:56   24            This textbook contains a number of articles.             It's

03:15:59   25   edited by a man named Brandstein.        We know Dr. Li knew
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 68 of 156 PageID #: 18529
                                                                                     193



03:16:05    1   about it because he cited it in his own article.            And this

03:16:11    2   book contains the information in the '049 patent.            As the

03:16:13    3   Court said to you, it's obvious, this information was in

03:16:16    4   the public before the filing of the '049 patent.

03:16:20    5              Now, there's another way we know that and that

03:16:25    6   Dr. Li knew it also and, that is, to look at the patent

03:16:28    7   itself.     And we'll -- you'll hear evidence from the stand

03:16:32    8   that when you walk through Dr. Li's patent, there are

03:16:37    9   remarkable similarities between his patent and the

03:16:40   10   information in this Brandstein collection of articles and

03:16:45   11   textbook.

03:16:46   12              The substance -- the words are not exactly the

03:16:49   13   same.     I don't mean to imply that.      They're slightly

03:16:52   14   changed.     But the substance of the '049 patent is the same

03:16:56   15   as, and certainly it's obvious to anyone who had skill and

03:17:00   16   was an expert in this area, that this textbook contained

03:17:06   17   the information that's in the '049 patent.

03:17:08   18              Now, because of that, the patent is invalid.

03:17:12   19              Now, as the Court has instructed you, there are

03:17:14   20   multiple ways that a patent can be invalid.           And one way is

03:17:19   21   that what the inventor created, as the Judge said earlier,

03:17:28   22   is inoperative.

03:17:30   23              And here we have information and evidence that

03:17:32   24   you're going to see during the course of this trial, and

03:17:34   25   it's information that comes directly from Dr. Li.            And his
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 69 of 156 PageID #: 18530
                                                                                     194



03:17:40    1   lawyer just made reference to it, although I want to make

03:17:44    2   sure that you understand exactly what Dr. Li said to the

03:17:46    3   Patent Office.

03:17:46    4              So what you see on the screen is a filing made

03:17:49    5   during this year, 2020, related to, as his lawyer said, the

03:17:59    6   '756 patent.     But what's important is the language that

03:18:01    7   Dr. Li was quoting to the Patent Office is also language

03:18:06    8   that is contained in the '049 patent.

03:18:09    9              If we went back and looked at those subparagraphs

03:18:12   10   and you looked at subparagraph (a), what you'll see when

03:18:15   11   you hear this from the witness stand is the subparagraph

03:18:22   12   that Dr. Li is talking to the Patent Office about is

03:18:25   13   actually in the '049 patent.

03:18:26   14              And so what did Dr. Li and his co-inventor,

03:18:31   15   Dr. Zhu, say.     Well, first of all, they swore under oath

03:18:34   16   that what they were telling the Patent Office was true.

03:18:37   17              The second thing they told the Patent Office is

03:18:39   18   the original patent is wholly or partly inoperative or

03:18:43   19   invalid.

03:18:44   20              Now, if I heard Mr. Fabricant right, he said they

03:18:49   21   never said that it was invalid.        Well, here they swore

03:18:52   22   under oath that that language was invalid by reason of

03:18:55   23   errors, and this is their signature to the Patent and

03:19:01   24   Trademark Office related to the very language that's

03:19:03   25   included in the '049 patent.

                                                                                     195



03:19:05    1             So you -- again, you don't have to believe me,

03:19:08    2   this is information, evidence, sworn testimony to the

03:19:15    3   Patent Office from the inventors themselves saying that it

03:19:18    4   is inoperative or invalid.

03:19:30    5             I need to pause and talk with you for just a

03:19:33    6   minute about these meetings that were referenced with

03:19:41    7   Amazon.

03:19:42    8             So let me say up front, did Amazon have meetings

03:19:46    9   with Dr. Li?     Yes, absolutely they did.       But I think where

03:19:46   10   the issue is going to be joined and what you're going to

03:19:49   11   have to ultimately determine is what were those meetings

03:19:50   12   about, and does that Echo contain any of Dr. Li's patented

03:19:57   13   technology?

03:19:58   14             Now, when Dr. Li met with Amazon, the information

03:20:02   15   that he was discussing with Amazon was already public.             He

03:20:05   16   had published it in his 2009 article.         On the right, you

03:20:10   17   see an excerpt from his website -- from his business Li

03:20:16   18   Creative.     So the information that he was sharing with

03:20:18   19   Amazon was public information.

03:20:21   20             The question is -- or at least one of the

03:20:24   21   questions is, was that information that he shared in those

03:20:28   22   meetings something that Amazon didn't know?           You were just

03:20:32   23   told by Vocalife's lawyer that Amazon learned something,

03:20:38   24   and what they learned they took and put in an Echo.

03:20:41   25             THE COURT:   Five minutes remaining.
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 71 of 156 PageID #: 18532
                                                                                     196



03:20:44    1              MR. DACUS:   Thank you, Your Honor.

03:20:44    2              What I'm going to tell you is nothing could be

03:20:47    3   further from the truth.       And you're going to have to make

03:20:50    4   that decision.

03:20:53    5              Here's some evidence you're going to see.          This is

03:20:53    6   a document from notes at Amazon taken at the time back in

03:20:58    7   2011.     No one who wrote these notes ever thought they'd see

03:21:01    8   the light of day in a courthouse, of course.

03:21:03    9              But what did they say about that meeting with

03:21:05   10   Dr. Li?     Not impressed with Li Creative.       And then they

03:21:10   11   say:    We will evaluate Audience, 10/24.        Audience is

03:21:14   12   another company they were going to meet with.

03:21:16   13              So at the time, they weren't saying, oh, Dr. Li

03:21:19   14   has this revolutionary invention and stuff we need for the

03:21:25   15   Echo.     To the contrary, they said not, impressed.

03:21:25   16              And it's not surprising because what they didn't

03:21:30   17   tell you is Dr. Li went all around the country shopping

03:21:33   18   these ideas to all these companies, Apple, Cisco, Samsung,

03:21:39   19   TiVo.     Nobody wanted it.    Nobody bid on this stuff.        It

03:21:42   20   just wasn't stuff that people needed, and it wasn't

03:21:46   21   something that was new.

03:21:47   22              One other thing they didn't tell you, in 2013,

03:21:52   23   Dr. Li actually applied for a job at Amazon in this same

03:21:57   24   area of speech recognition.

03:21:58   25              And, again, rather than Amazon saying, hey,
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 72 of 156 PageID #: 18533
                                                                                     197



03:22:00    1   Dr. Li, he has stuff that we need, when you see the

03:22:03    2   evidence in this case, and what you see in front of you are

03:22:07    3   notes that were taken by Rohit Prasad, and Mr. Prasad will

03:22:13    4   testify in this case, he said, look, this -- this guy, he

03:22:17    5   doesn't -- he doesn't have anything that we need.            He

03:22:19    6   appears -- all he wants to do is sell his business to us,

03:22:24    7   but -- but we don't need it.

03:22:26    8              So did they meet with Dr. Li?       Yes.   Did they

03:22:30    9   learn anything from him?      No.     Did they take his technology

03:22:34   10   and include it in the Echo?         Absolutely not.    Absolutely

03:22:38   11   not.

03:22:39   12              And I -- I know counsel for Vocalife showed you

03:22:44   13   these notes about these other companies that we supposedly

03:22:48   14   met with.    You'll -- you'll hear from the witness stand

03:22:50   15   that Amazon as one of the leading technology companies in

03:22:56   16   the world, as you very well might expect, meets with dozens

03:23:01   17   and dozens of small companies.         We're always trying to

03:23:03   18   improve the technology at Amazon.

03:23:05   19              In fact, one of those companies that he showed

03:23:07   20   you, Amazon actually bought for a lot of money.            So when

03:23:10   21   folks bring stuff to us, technology to us, that has value,

03:23:15   22   that is something new, Amazon recognizes it, and many times

03:23:19   23   buys it.    But when you don't bring something new, they

03:23:22   24   don't.

03:23:23   25              Now, let me close by talking a little bit about
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 73 of 156 PageID #: 18534
                                                                                     198



03:23:27    1   this -- these damages issues.       And I'm --

03:23:30    2             THE COURT:   You have two minutes remaining.

03:23:31    3             MR. DACUS:   Thank you, Your Honor.

03:23:32    4             Amazon certainly does not believe they owe these

03:23:38    5   folks a dime because we don't -- we don't use the '049

03:23:41    6   patent.

03:23:42    7             But here's what I want to ask you to do when you

03:23:44    8   listen to the evidence about damages.         Often, damages can

03:23:47    9   tell you what lawsuits are really about.          And I know

03:23:52   10   they've stood up here and told you what -- what they want

03:23:54   11   you to believe it's about, but the damages portion can tell

03:23:58   12   you what it's really about.

03:23:59   13             And, also, when you're judging credibility, if you

03:24:03   14   listen to how they get to this $31 million ultimately, I

03:24:09   15   think that will tell you a lot about credibility not only

03:24:15   16   in the damages case but the entirety of the case.

03:24:16   17             Over the next week and a half, we're going to have

03:24:19   18   the opportunity to present evidence to you.           We certainly

03:24:22   19   look forward to that opportunity.        We'll have an

03:24:25   20   opportunity at the end to talk to you in closing.            Until

03:24:29   21   that time, I appreciate very much your attention this

03:24:32   22   afternoon, and look forward to the next week and a half.

03:24:34   23             Thank you, Your Honor.

03:24:37   24             THE COURT:   All right.     Ladies and gentlemen,

03:24:38   25   you've heard opening statements for counsel for -- from
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 74 of 156 PageID #: 18535
                                                                                     199



03:24:42    1   counsel for the parties.

03:24:44    2             Counsel, at this time, let me inquire, does either

03:24:46    3   party wish to invoke the Rule?

03:24:48    4             MS. TRUELOVE:    Plaintiff does, Your Honor.

03:24:49    5             MR. DACUS:   Defendant does, Your Honor.

03:24:52    6             THE COURT:   And am I correct in assuming that that

03:24:54    7   would exclude expert witnesses but apply to other

03:24:58    8   witnesses?

03:24:59    9             MS. TRUELOVE:    Yes, that's correct.

03:25:00   10             MR. DACUS:   Yes, Your Honor.

03:25:02   11             THE COURT:   All right.     Then the Rule has been

03:25:05   12   invoked, not including expert witnesses.

03:25:07   13             If you are a fact witness in this case and not an

03:25:13   14   expert witness, you are not permitted to remain in the

03:25:16   15   courtroom until the time you are called to testify.             Expert

03:25:19   16   witnesses are exempt from this application of the Rule and

03:25:23   17   may be present, as are corporate representatives.

03:25:25   18             All right.   At this point, ladies and gentlemen,

03:25:30   19   we're ready to proceed with the Plaintiff's case-in-chief

03:25:33   20   and hear from their first witness.

03:25:35   21             But before we do that, we're going to take a short

03:25:37   22   recess.   And this is one of those times when I'm going to

03:25:40   23   tell you -- I don't expect us to be out of the courtroom

03:25:45   24   very long, so you may simply close and leave your notebooks

03:25:49   25   in your chairs when you go to the jury room for recess.

03:25:54    1              As you do, remember all the instructions I have

03:25:54    2   given you, including not to discuss the case among

03:25:55    3   yourselves, and I expect to be back in here in 10 or so

03:25:58    4   minutes.

03:25:58    5              So, with that, the jury is excused for recess.

03:26:01    6              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

03:26:02    7              (Jury out.)

03:45:31   12              THE COURT:    Be seated, please.

03:45:32   13              Mr. Fabricant, is the Plaintiff prepared to call

03:45:38   14   its first witness?

03:45:39   15              MR. FABRICANT:    Yes, Your Honor, the Plaintiff is

03:45:41   16   prepared.

03:45:41   17              THE COURT:    All right.   Let's bring in the jury,

03:45:46   18   please.

03:45:46   19              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      Yes, sir.

03:46:13   20              (Jury in.)

03:46:15   21              THE COURT:    Please be seated.

03:46:17   22              Plaintiff, call your first witness, please.

03:46:28   23              MR. FABRICANT:    Your Honor, we call to the stand

03:46:30   24   as our first witness, Dr. Qi "Peter" Li.

03:46:38   25              THE COURT:    All right.   Dr. Li, if you'll come

03:46:47    3              THE COURT:   Please come around, sir, have a seat

03:46:55    4   at the witness stand.

03:47:03    5              Counsel, you may proceed.

03:47:13    8                           DIRECT EXAMINATION

03:47:14    9   BY MR. FABRICANT:

03:47:14   10   Q.   Dr. Li, what is your formal full name?

03:47:21   11   A.   Qi Li.

03:47:23   12   Q.   And are you known by any other name in your business?

03:47:26   13   A.   Peter Li.

03:47:29   14   Q.   When did you get the name Peter Li?

03:47:33   15   A.   When I came to the United State.

03:47:37   16   Q.   And, Dr. Li, do you, I understand, have a hearing

03:47:41   17   problem?

03:47:41   18   A.   Yeah, I have hear problem.      So when you talk, please be

03:51:07    1   A.   Well, it's one of the most wonderful, most famous

03:51:09    2   research lab of engineering in the world.          It has 13 Nobel

03:51:20    3   Prize winners.      Many of the technology in the world even

03:51:20    4   today were invented by Bell Labs.        When I was a student at

03:51:30    5   school, many of this knowledge I learned from textbook that

03:51:36    6   was from Bell Labs.

03:51:38    7   Q.   Dr. Li, do you -- do you know why it's called Bell

03:51:41    8   Labs?

03:51:41    9   A.   So it's after the name of Alexander Graham Bell.            He

03:51:52   10   invented telephone.

03:51:54   11   Q.   And what did you think about getting a job at Bell Labs

03:52:04   12   when you got that position?

03:52:04   13   A.   I was so excited.    After 11 years of work, full-time

03:52:10   14   work, part-time study, full-time study, part-time work,

03:52:14   15   finally, I realize I got the first part of my American

03:52:19   16   dream.      I was so excited     to -- to be able to work with

03:52:24   17   Nobel Prize winners, the top research scientists, to know

03:52:30   18   the best knowledge to invent the new technologies.

03:52:35   19   Q.   Dr. Li, once you started work at Bell Labs, what type

03:52:38   20   of work were you personally doing there?

03:52:40   21   A.   I work acoustics, speech recognition, speaker

03:52:47   22   recognition, voice control, that kind of technologies.

03:52:53   23   Q.   And did there come a time when you left Bell Labs?

03:52:58   24   A.   Yes.    I left Bell Labs in 2002.

03:53:02   25   Q.   And why did you leave Bell Labs?

03:53:04    1   A.   I remember I have the second dream.         I want to be an

03:53:11    2   inventor.     So I want to have my own -- the owner of my own

03:53:15    3   company, so I have more freedom to do more inventions to

03:53:19    4   develop new technology and new products.          I want to

03:53:27    5   contribute my knowledge to the society to develop new

03:53:31    6   product, new technology, to benefit people.

03:53:34    7   Q.   So did -- did you go to work at -- at a different

03:53:36    8   company?

03:53:38    9   A.   After Bell Labs, I opened my own company.

03:53:42   10   Q.   And what was your own company called?

03:53:43   11   A.   My own company called Li Creative Technologies.

03:53:51   12   Q.   Why did you call it Li Creative?

03:53:54   13   A.   In the beginning, I want to follow Bell Labs.           I want

03:53:59   14   to use the name Li Labs.      And also in New Jersey, there was

03:54:04   15   another famous lab, Edison Labs, but my colleagues gave me

03:54:11   16   suggestion that if you use labs, you don't have products,

03:54:16   17   you're just the research.

03:54:18   18               So -- so I put creative in the company name, call

03:54:22   19   it Li Creative Technologies.

03:54:24   20   Q.   Now, Dr. Li, does Li Creative Technologies exist today?

03:54:29   21               I'm sorry, you couldn't hear.

03:54:31   22               Does Li Creative Technologies exist today?

03:54:33   23   A.   Yes.

03:54:34   24   Q.   And who is the owner of that company?

03:54:36   25   A.   I'm the owner of that company.

03:54:39    1   Q.   And what does that company do?

03:54:42    2   A.   We do a lot of work for the U.S. Government.           We

03:54:49    3   develop technology to support the soldiers in the war.

03:54:54    4   Q.   Does Li Creative Technologies have any relationship

03:54:58    5   with the Plaintiff, Vocalife?

03:55:00    6   A.   Vocalife is a spin-off of Li Creative Technologies.            I

03:55:09    7   said Li Creative Technologies is doing research and the

03:55:13    8   development work, work on a lot of research contracts, work

03:55:19    9   on different research entities.        And microphone technology

03:55:23   10   is one -- has matured, so we have that part of technology

03:55:29   11   off, to be a spin-off, to be its own company, to sell

03:55:34   12   products to license technology to other companies.

03:55:38   13   Q.   Dr. Li, does Vocalife have any products today?

03:55:40   14   A.   Yes.   Vocalife has a product called CrispMic II.

03:55:48   15   Q.   Dr. Li, I believe you have a physical exhibit with you,

03:55:52   16   Plaintiff's Exhibit 644; is that correct?          Is that -- do

03:55:57   17   you have the physical exhibit?

03:55:59   18   A.   Oh, yes.

03:56:00   19   Q.   And what -- could you -- could you tell the jury what

03:56:03   20   is Plaintiff's Exhibit 644?

03:56:04   21   A.   PTX-644?

03:56:08   22   Q.   Yes, please --

03:56:10   23   A.   That's the -- that's the CrispMic microphone.

03:56:14   24   Q.   All right.   What is the Crisp microphone?         Could you

03:56:19   25   describe it, please?

                                                                                     207



03:56:19    1   A.   I'll be happy to describe that.        Half of this surface,

03:56:23    2   you can see four holes.      That's four microphone components

03:56:28    3   under that.     We call that microphone array, since it's more

03:56:34    4   than one microphones.

03:56:37    5              And you can see, this is a circle.        So we also

03:56:41    6   call this a circular microphone array.          And the inside of

03:56:46    7   this device, there is a regular circuit board.            You will

03:56:53    8   see it light up as a green-colored board.

03:56:55    9              And we'll have a microphone surface mounted on the

03:56:58   10   board.     And there is a processor -- digital signal

03:57:05   11   processor under the board to do all the communication to

03:57:08   12   make this device to be intelligent.

03:57:11   13   Q.   Now, Dr. Li, can you describe -- how does that device

03:57:15   14   work?    If you put it on a table, what does it do?          How does

03:57:19   15   it work?

03:57:20   16   A.   Right.   This device is to support far-field speech

03:57:29   17   recognition and far-field recording.         The microphone, which

03:57:33   18   we're using now, is called close-talking microphone.             It

03:57:36   19   cannot catch your words in far distance.

03:57:39   20              So based on my appearance, based on the market, we

03:57:43   21   develop this new technology so people could talk -- talk

03:57:47   22   anywhere in the room in any directions and also in

03:57:54   23   different distances.     Either you are far away from the

03:57:57   24   microphone, the mic can still capture your voice with very

03:58:01   25   good sound quality to support speech recordation.            It's
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 83 of 156 PageID #: 18544
                                                                                     208



03:58:06    1   called automatic speech recordation.

03:58:10    2               Why is this important?    Because when you're far

03:58:12    3   away from microphone, the microphone won't pick up

03:58:15    4   background noise, and for speech recognition software, we

03:58:21    5   need this kind of technology to capture words from

03:58:24    6   different directions, also give you very good sound

03:58:27    7   quality, voice quality, so speech recognition behind that

03:58:33    8   can give you real high accuracy to be able to do the things

03:58:36    9   which you --

03:58:37   10   Q.   Dr. Li, I would like to show you Plaintiff's Exhibit

03:58:43   11   564.   564?

03:58:44   12   A.   Yes.

03:58:47   13   Q.   Can you explain what Plaintiff's Exhibit 564 is?

03:58:54   14   A.   Yes.    This -- this kind of document, we'll call it a --

03:58:58   15   a data sheet for the product and technology introduction.

03:59:05   16   Q.   Are the features of the CrispMic data sheet listed

03:59:09   17   anywhere on this document?

03:59:10   18   A.   Yes, I can see that.

03:59:11   19   Q.   Where are they listed?

03:59:13   20   A.   So the PCB board, the picture, you can see the inside

03:59:19   21   of this device.

03:59:20   22   Q.   And what is that -- you called it a PCB board that's

03:59:24   23   circled on the right side in the middle?          Is that what you

03:59:28   24   call it?

03:59:29   25   A.   Yes.    You can see -- that's good.      Thank you.

03:59:32    1               You can see four black box that -- second

03:59:39    2   column -- microphones, four microphones, and you'll see

03:59:43    3   eight light points.     Those are LED lights.

03:59:50    4   Q.   And what -- at the top, the document says:          CrispMic II

03:59:59    5   Developer Module.     What is a developer module?

04:00:06    6   A.   We have -- actually two products for this particular

04:00:10    7   developer module.     That's what we sell to business -- to

04:00:16    8   companies that use our module inside of their device to

04:00:19    9   support far-field speech recognition.

04:00:22   10   Q.   How would someone else use your developer module inside

04:00:26   11   their device?     How would that work?

04:00:28   12   A.   So their device, whatever device it is, it can capture

04:00:33   13   voice from distance, and to promote real high speech

04:00:39   14   recognition accuracy.

04:00:39   15   Q.   The CrispMic product that you showed us first,

04:00:52   16   Exhibit 644, do you sell that to anyone today?

04:00:58   17   A.   Yes.

04:00:58   18   Q.   Who do you sell that to?

04:01:00   19   A.   We sell that to three kind of customers.          Number one,

04:01:04   20   the U.S. Government, the IRS, they purchase 1,800 of this

04:01:11   21   device for their office nationwide.         So next time when you

04:01:16   22   visit IRS office, you will see this microphone sit on the

04:01:22   23   table to support you for better service.          That's the first

04:01:28   24   kind of customer.

04:01:29   25               Second, the customer that uses the microphone, the
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 85 of 156 PageID #: 18546
                                                                                     210



04:01:34    1   PCB board in their device, that's second customer for -- to

04:01:38    2   support their products.      We have one customer that just

04:01:42    3   ordered last week 400 of this board for further evaluation

04:01:48    4   because of the -- people don't want touch buttons, people

04:01:54    5   just want to talk.     So our device supports that, that's the

04:01:59    6   second.

04:01:59    7   Q.   Dr. Li, Exhibit 564, Plaintiff's Exhibit 564, to whom

04:02:05    8   is this document available?       To whom is this document

04:08:15    9   was Wei Li working on?

04:08:16   10   A.   He work on project linear microphone array, later

04:08:27   11   become a product we call CrispMic I.

04:08:29   12   Q.   And can you explain the -- the features of CrispMic I?

04:08:37   13   A.   CrispMic I, that's a -- a very special array but a

04:08:46   14   special design for computer monitors and for ATMs.            It's

04:08:51   15   limited for people can only talk in the front of the

04:08:56   16   device.     It can click on the screen, and you can just talk

04:08:59   17   in that direction.

04:09:02   18               It does not support far-field, does not support

04:09:08   19   sound source localization, does not support people talk

04:09:13   20   from any direction in a room.       There was -- is no adaptive

04:09:19   21   beamforming in that device.

04:09:20   22   Q.   I'd like to show you Exhibit 273, Plaintiff's Exhibit

04:09:26   23   273.

04:09:26   24               Can you tell me what this exhibit is, Dr. Li?

04:09:31   25   A.   Yes.    This is a paper which we published in the
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 90 of 156 PageID #: 18551
                                                                                     215



04:09:39    1   conference, and as you'll see the picture, that's a

04:09:43    2   CrispMic I.     And when the picture is clear, it can be

04:09:49    3   clipped on top of computer monitor to support speech

04:09:54    4   recognition.

04:09:54    5   Q.   Now, Dr. Li, you were in the courtroom during the

04:09:58    6   opening -- opening statements today; is that true?

04:10:00    7   A.   Yes.

04:10:00    8   Q.   And you heard the opening statement of Amazon's

04:10:03    9   counsel?

04:10:04   10   A.   Right.

04:10:05   11   Q.   And I believe he put up on the screens this article?

04:10:10   12   A.   Right.

04:10:11   13   Q.   This article, is it the same article?

04:10:13   14   A.   Yes.

04:10:13   15   Q.   So my question, is how does CrispMic I, which is

04:10:20   16   depicted in the article, compare to what is in your '049

04:10:26   17   patent?

04:10:26   18   A.   That's a totally different.       This is designed for

04:10:31   19   different application.      It's used different technology.          As

04:10:36   20   I said, there's no sound source localization, there's no

04:10:41   21   adaptive beamforming, there's no circular array in this

04:10:44   22   device.     It's totally different.

04:10:48   23   Q.   Is that a picture in Figure 1 of the CrispMic I?

04:10:54   24   A.   Right.

04:10:54   25   Q.   And what does it say under the photograph?
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 91 of 156 PageID #: 18552
                                                                                     216



04:10:58    1               MR. FABRICANT:   If you'd show the sentence or two

04:10:59    2   under the photograph, please.

04:11:00    3   A.   In this paper, we present a portable microphone array

04:11:05    4   device, named CrispMic, where both the size and performance

04:11:10    5   have been properly addressed.

04:11:14    6   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)      So that was the subject of your

04:11:16    7   article --

04:11:17    8   A.   Right.

04:11:19    9   Q.   -- CrispMic I?

04:11:21   10               Now, what else did you do at Li Creative with

04:11:31   11   respect to the development of microphone arrays?

04:11:33   12   A.   We developed prototype using circular microphone array.

04:11:40   13   We called this VoiceFocus.

04:11:43   14   Q.   VoiceFocus, is that the name?

04:11:45   15   A.   That's right.

04:11:45   16   Q.   And when did you start the development of the

04:11:48   17   VoiceFocus prototype?

04:11:50   18   A.   From 2008.

04:11:55   19   Q.   And who worked on the development of the VoiceFocus

04:11:59   20   prototype?

04:12:00   21   A.   Dr. Manli Zhu.

04:12:01   22   Q.   And did you work on that, as well?

04:12:05   23   A.   Yes.

04:12:06   24   Q.   And what -- what was the -- what was the subject --

04:12:11   25   what were you trying to accomplish with the VoiceFocus
    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 92 of 156 PageID #: 18553
                                                                                     217



04:12:15    1   prototype?

04:12:16    2   A.   As I said, since I have been working in the field of

04:12:20    3   microphones for many years, I collected feedback from our

04:12:25    4   customers.

04:12:26    5               So the CrispMic I can only support speaker talking

04:12:29    6   one.   We'll have customers asking us why not develop a

04:12:34    7   product people can talk from different directions, from

04:12:37    8   far-field, from distance, while it can also support good

04:12:42    9   speech recognition.

04:12:42   10               So that's the reason we started work on that

04:12:48   11   product.     We understand for the future, there will be a lot

04:12:52   12   of applications for this kind of technology and device.

04:12:57   13   Q.   Dr. Li, can you characterize how easy or difficult the

04:13:03   14   development of the VoiceFocus was?

04:13:06   15   A.   Yes.    It took us several years to design and develop

04:13:14   16   the product, and the first idea how to -- how to do that,

04:13:21   17   but later, Dr. Manli Zhu, she spent a lot of time to

04:13:27   18   develop all these algorithm and software and the hardware

04:13:35   19   together to build a device.

04:13:37   20               It was not easy for small businesses.        We have

04:13:41   21   limited people.     But, surprisingly, we got out the device

04:13:46   22   designed and developed, and now it's available for

04:13:49   23   customer.

04:13:50   24   Q.   And did you actually ever sell a VoiceFocus device?

04:13:55   25   A.   For the VoiceFocus, we didn't sell that.          We build a

                                                                                     218



04:14:02    1   prototype.

04:14:05    2             MR. FABRICANT:    Let's show the witness Plaintiff's

04:14:09    3   50.

04:14:09    4   Q.    (By Mr. Fabricant)    Dr. Li, what is Plaintiff's Exhibit

04:14:12    5   50?

04:14:13    6   A.    That's what they call VoiceFocus Conference Phone.

04:14:19    7   Q.    And what were the features of this VoiceFocus

04:14:24    8   Conference Phone?

04:14:25    9   A.    You can see on the top of the device, there's a

04:14:28   10   circular microphone array.       Actually, it has eight

04:14:32   11   microphone components in a circle.         And it has a similar

04:14:37   12   processor inside and also has -- has this particular

04:14:43   13   design, it also has loud speakers.

04:14:45   14   Q.    And how does the technology, which is VoiceFocus

04:14:51   15   prototype, compare to the technology in your '049 patent?

04:14:56   16   A.    This is a limitation, one of the limitations of '049

04:15:03   17   patent.

04:15:03   18   Q.    What -- what features of the patent are found in the

04:15:07   19   VoiceFocus prototype?

04:15:08   20   A.    Okay.   As you can see, it has a microphone array.          It's

04:15:12   21   a circular array.     It can do sound source localization,

04:15:19   22   adaptive beamforming, and noise reduction.

04:15:22   23   Q.    And are those features indicated on the -- on the -- on

04:15:27   24   the exhibit?

04:15:29   25   A.    As you can see, under the title advanced DSP

04:15:38    1   algorithms, it lists adaptive beamforming, sound source

04:15:41    2   localization, adaptive echo cancellation, adaptive noise

04:15:47    3   reduction/speech enhancement.

04:15:51    4   Q.   And what does the last sentence under those features

04:15:54    5   mean?

04:15:55    6   A.   This means that -- called support to develop this

04:16:02    7   technology from New Jersey Committee Of Science and

04:16:12    8   Technology.

04:16:12    9   Q.   Did there come a time when you took any efforts to

04:26:26    1   A.   That's the NDA which we signed.

04:26:33    2   Q.   What was your understanding when you signed this NDA?

04:26:39    3   What -- what did it mean to you?

04:26:41    4   A.   So it means that the information which we exchanged

04:26:46    5   with you recently in the meeting said we still own the

04:26:54    6   technology, and the information can only be used for

04:26:59    7   business relations.     The information we told them -- or

04:27:02    8   they told us from the meeting cannot be used for product.

04:27:10    9   Q.   Did you have any further written communications with

04:27:18   10   Amazon after signing the NDA before the meeting?

04:27:40   16   that told him what we wanted to do, which technology we

04:27:47   17   were going to introduce.

04:27:48   18   Q.   And were you suggesting the afternoon of October 17th?

04:27:52   19   A.   Yes.

04:27:53   20   Q.   What did you offer to show and demonstrate to Amazon,

04:32:29   20   brought a CrispMic for you.

04:32:33   21   Q.   Why did you ask him whether his colleagues at Amazon

04:32:38   22   knew that he had once worked for Li Creative Technologies?

04:32:45   23   A.   Asking him if your colleagues know that you work for Li

04:32:52   24   Creative Technologies because I don't know if the other

04:32:53   25   colleagues at Amazon knew that.       I said I want to confirm.

04:34:34    5   filed; two issued.     Was that actually in the presentation

04:34:34    6   that you delivered that day on October 17, 2011, at Amazon;

04:34:38    7   is that true?

04:34:38    8   A.   That's true.    At that time we had two issued patent and

04:34:44    9   13 filed patent.

04:34:47   10               MR. FABRICANT:   Next page, please.

04:34:51   11   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)      And is this the award, the one at

04:34:52   12   the far right column, that you previously testified to from

04:34:55   13   the CES show?

04:34:58   14   A.   That's right.

04:35:00   15               MR. FABRICANT:   And if you would go to the next

04:35:02   16   page.

04:35:02   17   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)      What are these core technologies

04:35:06   18   that you were presenting?

04:35:08   19   A.   I present -- I listed here on the top, you can see

04:35:14   20   microphone array, including linear and circular array;

04:35:21   21   noise reduction; echo cancellation; sound source

04:35:27   22   localization; and also 3D sound systems.

04:35:33   23   Q.   Did you present all of those technologies to Amazon on

04:35:36   24   that date?

04:35:37   25   A.   Yes, I did.

04:35:39    1              MR. FABRICANT:     And if you would go two pages.

04:35:48    2   One more.

04:35:48    3   Q.    (By Mr. Fabricant)     And what does this page of the

04:35:50    4   presentation depict, Dr. Li?

04:35:52    5   A.    So it's called echo cancellation.      And on bottom, you

04:35:56    6   see a table.       There's some buttons.    They press the

04:36:02    7   buttons.       People can hear the audio, and compare the

04:36:06    8   difference by using microphone array system.

04:36:09    9              MR. FABRICANT:     And on the next page.

04:36:11   10   Q.    (By Mr. Fabricant)     What does this page of the

04:36:16   11   presentation depict?

04:36:17   12   A.    This page depicts sound source localization and

04:36:23   13   circular array.       You can find out the location of a speaker

04:36:27   14   in the room.

04:36:28   15   Q.    Where did you get the figure that's been highlighted

04:36:31   16   over on the left; do you remember?

04:36:33   17   A.    Yeah.    So this figure shows a picture of microphone

04:36:42   18   components.       There are eight microphone component in a

04:36:46   19   circle.       So we call this circular microphone array.

04:37:04   20              MR. FABRICANT:     And if you would go to the page

04:37:07   21   entitled Speech and Speaker Recognition.         Slide down

04:37:16   22   please.       Keep going.   Right there.   One back.   There you

04:37:18   23   go.

04:37:19   24   Q.    (By Mr. Fabricant)     What does this page detect,

04:37:21   25   Dr. Li -- depict?

                                                                                    233



04:37:22    1   A.   The title is Speech and Speaker Recognition.          That is

04:37:26    2   the use of microphone array to do speech recognition, okay.

04:37:30    3               And on the photo -- on the picture, you can see we

04:37:37    4   demoed this to Amazon people.       There is a circular array

04:37:42    5   with four microphone components on top, one, two, three,

04:37:47    6   four.   And when people talk from four different directions,

04:37:53    7   yes, the line in the center will point to that speaker to

04:37:58    8   indicate that the system can find out the sound source.

04:38:03    9   Q.   Dr. Li, you were here, as you said, for the opening of

04:38:07   10   Amazon's counsel.     He showed some video, and he said

04:38:11   11   everything happens in Seattle, Washington, and there's some

04:38:14   12   brain there called Alexa.

04:38:16   13               What does that have to do with a microphone array

04:38:18   14   that detects speech, can you -- can you tell the jury?

04:38:21   15   A.   In our terminology, this is called front end.          Whatever

04:38:27   16   they showed in the picture, the five-second video, go

04:38:31   17   through Internet, go to their -- their computer server,

04:38:40   18   that we call back end.     The patent -- the invention is

04:38:46   19   about front end, about a microphone.        That's our invention.

04:38:50   20   Q.   And when you showed us your developer module product,

04:38:55   21   is that front end?

04:38:56   22   A.   That's front end.

04:38:58   23   Q.   And can that be used in anybody's product for front

04:39:02   24   end?

04:39:02   25   A.   Yes.

04:39:02    1   Q.   Does it matter what's happening at the back end with

04:39:05    2   respect to your invention?

04:39:07    3   A.   Any kind of back end with our microphone can support.

04:39:16    4             MR. FABRICANT:    If you'd go to the next to the

04:39:17    5   last page of this exhibit.      Right -- one more back.        One

04:39:26    6   more forward, I'm sorry.      Keep going.     Yes, one more, back.

04:39:35    7   Yeah, stop.

04:39:36    8   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)    What was depicted on this page that

04:39:39    9   you presented to Amazon?

04:39:42   10   A.   I want to present some applications for our technology.

04:39:48   11   And as you can see, the audio search, voice search, music

04:39:57   12   search, why I present that, I presented technologies to

04:40:02   13   Amazon in the beginning, right?

04:40:07   14             We think it's better to present some design idea,

04:40:13   15   product idea so it will be less of a technology from us.

04:40:16   16   And also because we signed an NDA, they said, we'll see.

04:40:20   17   We give them product idea and that they may be even more

04:40:25   18   happy for us to work with them and license our technology.

04:40:27   19             At that time, the statement in the opening, at

04:40:32   20   that time, Amazon was a bookstore, right?         They sell books

04:40:41   21   online.   Also, they have a lot of music.        They sell music.

04:40:47   22   Thought, okay, that's good idea, right?         They can use our

04:40:50   23   technology to retrieve music for at least two reasons.

04:40:57   24   They have a good collection of music.

04:40:59   25             Second, at that time, speech recognition --

                                                                                    235



04:41:02    1   recognition technology was not mature, mature.           It cannot

04:41:05    2   do anything.     But it's good to use voice to retrieve music

04:41:12    3   because the music title -- are fixed.         It's easy to be --

04:41:16    4   search to find out -- to be recognized by a speech

04:41:22    5   technology at that time.

04:41:24    6            My suggestion, based on my 20 years of research

04:41:28    7   and experience, I think I present a very good idea to

04:41:32    8   Amazon, not just Amazon but also -- but also benefitted the

04:41:38    9   potential customers in the future by utilizing this

04:41:43   10   technology to fulfill their life.

04:41:48   11   Q.   Dr. Li, I'd like to show you Plaintiff's Exhibit 44.

04:41:55   12   Why did you write and what did you send to Amazon on -- on

04:42:01   13   October 24 after the meeting?

04:42:05   14   A.   I have two reasons.    First, during the meeting, Amazon

04:42:09   15   people asked me to send these slides to them.          I promised

04:42:15   16   them when I get back to my office, I will send them an

04:42:18   17   email, number one.

04:42:19   18            Number two, when I had communication with Jerry Wu

04:42:25   19   by email, I asked him, you know, we want the business

04:42:29   20   discussions, not just technical discussions, in the

04:42:33   21   beginning.     And he promised we talk about technical first.

04:42:38   22   Then followed by business discussion.

04:42:41   23            Okay.    Based on the promise, we send back an

04:42:45   24   email.   We answer them.    Okay.    Li Creative Technologies,

04:42:48   25   you people infringe our technology.        Now we start to talk

                                                                                    236



04:42:52    1   about business.

04:42:54    2               THE COURT:     Dr. Li, if I could ask if you would

04:42:56    3   slow down a little bit in your speech, especially given

04:42:59    4   your accent, I would think the jury can follow you better

04:43:03    5   if you would speak more slowly.

04:43:05    6               THE WITNESS:     Okay.     Your Honor.

04:43:06    7               THE COURT:     Will you try to do that for me?

04:43:11    8               THE WITNESS:     Thank you, Your Honor.

04:43:11    9               THE COURT:     Okay.     Let's proceed, Mr. Fabricant.

04:43:14   10   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)       Dr. Li, did you ever ultimately do

04:43:16   11   any business with Amazon?

04:43:18   12   A.   No.

04:43:18   13   Q.   We saw during Amazon counsel's opening, reference to an

04:43:27   14   interview that you had with Amazon for a job?

04:43:30   15   A.   Yes.

04:43:31   16   Q.   Do you remember that?

04:43:31   17   A.   Yes.

04:43:32   18   Q.   Okay.    Did you, in fact, interview with Amazon?

04:43:35   19   A.   Yes.

04:43:36   20   Q.   When was that?

04:43:37   21   A.   2013.

04:43:39   22   Q.   At the time of the interview, had Amazon launched any

04:43:44   23   product at all that you believed was infringing your

04:43:49    1   Q.   And what was the purpose why you met with Amazon in

04:43:55    2   2013 or had an interview?

04:43:57    3   A.   We had been contacted by Amazon human resource.          They

04:44:02    4   are interested in my expertise -- actually, I had been

04:44:10    5   contacted almost every year.      And they want to set up time

04:44:15    6   for interview, and also they posted a job, they were hiring

04:44:23    7   speech people, and I also respond to their job -- I want to

04:44:27    8   talk to them.

04:44:28    9   Q.   Did you have the interview?

04:44:29   10   A.   I had telephone interview with them.

04:44:36   11   Q.   And did you get any job offer from Amazon?

04:44:38   12   A.   No, I didn't.

04:44:39   13   Q.   Did you have any further contact with Amazon after that

04:44:47   14   period when the interview was?

04:44:50   15   A.   Later in 2014, we were invited to attend an event

04:45:00   16   organized by Amazon.

04:45:03   17   Q.   And what type of event?

04:45:04   18   A.   That's when Amazon officially announced the Echo

04:45:12   19   product to public.

04:45:14   20   Q.   And did you attend the event?

04:45:17   21   A.   I attended that event.

04:45:18   22   Q.   Where did the event take place?

04:45:20   23   A.   In New York City.

04:45:22   24   Q.   Did -- did you take anyone from your company to the

04:45:27   25   event?

04:45:30    1   A.   Dr. Manli Zhu.    She attended the event with me.

04:45:35    2   Q.   And can you describe what happened at the event?

04:45:38    3   A.   Yes.    At the event was a large room, the size similar

04:45:44    4   to this room.     We arrived a little earlier, so we stand in

04:45:49    5   the front.

04:45:49    6               And they put Echo device, the new product, at the

04:45:56    7   top of the table in the front.       So since we arrived

04:46:02    8   earlier, we were very close to the device.

04:46:08    9               And then they started to demo the technology, the

04:46:11   10   product.     And they have people talk from different location

04:46:17   11   to the device and talk from different distance to retrieve

04:46:28   12   music.

04:46:29   13               And from the device, we could see on top of the

04:46:34   14   angle, there's a circle of rings, that also show from their

04:46:38   15   opening.     And when people talk from that direction, the

04:46:43   16   ring -- the light point up -- point to that direction.

04:46:46   17               So that's like an indicator to -- we call sound

04:46:54   18   source localization.     They are using the technology to find

04:46:57   19   the location of sound source.

04:46:58   20               And also on the top of the device, there are a

04:47:04   21   ring of holes.     So we know -- from there, we knew that was

04:47:12   22   a circular microphone array.

04:47:13   23               And, also, they talk from a distance array.

04:47:17   24   That's what we call far-field.       When -- they must use

04:47:23   25   adaptive beamforming technology and a noise reduction

                                                                                    239



04:47:27    1   technology to support speech recognition in far-field.

04:47:32    2                So from the demo, I was surprised.     That's exactly

04:47:43    3   the same thing I told them in the meeting on the demo when

04:47:46    4   we visit them.       Everything is there, circular microphone

04:47:51    5   array, adaptive beamforming, noise reduction and --

04:48:06    6   beamforming, noise reduction, and all -- everything

04:48:08    7   that's -- that's in there, right?

04:48:12    8                So I was very upset.   And, you know, I was not

04:48:23    9   happy.       It's too bad we told you this technology, told

04:48:28   10   Amazon the technology, that you didn't license the

04:48:31   11   technology from us.       You know we had the patent.      You know,

04:48:35   12   we signed an NDA.       And so I said they were using the things

04:48:42   13   in our patent, the technology in our patent.

04:48:44   14   Q.    Did you say anything to your -- your colleague you were

04:48:46   15   with, Dr. Zhu?

04:48:47   16   A.    Yes.    So Dr. Manli Zhu was there with me.      I talk to --

04:48:56   17   I told her, that's exactly in our patent.         That's what we

04:49:00   18   told Amazon when I was with Amazon.        And she agreed with

04:49:06   19   me.

04:49:07   20   Q.    Did you talk to any -- other than to see the

04:49:09   21   demonstration and look at the device, did you talk to any

04:49:12   22   of the Amazon engineers that were there?

04:49:14   23   A.    Since I was standing in front very close to the demo

04:49:23   24   engineer, so I tried to confirm with the engineer and ask

04:49:27   25   them, you know, are you using sound source localization,

04:49:31    1   since we saw the -- the wide circle of the light?           And he

04:49:35    2   said, yes.

04:49:37    3               And -- and then we asked -- asked him, you know,

04:49:43    4   is that circular microphone array?          Yes.   And are you using

04:49:48    5   adaptive beamforming and noise reduction to support the

04:49:55    6   far-field?     Yeah.   He said:   Yes.     They were very proud

04:50:00    7   about the product, about the features.

04:50:02    8   Q.   Dr. Li, on the -- on the date of that meeting, which

04:50:06    9   was November 20, 2014, what was the status of your patent

04:50:11   10   application?

04:50:12   11   A.   We have -- the patent was just issued one month before

04:50:18   12   I visited the event.

04:50:21   13   Q.   Did you tell anyone at the event that you were upset?

04:50:26   14   A.   I told Manli Zhu.    And also following the event, I

04:50:37   15   wrote a letter to Rohit Prasad.          He is the leader of the

04:50:48   16   Echo group.

04:50:48   17   Q.   Let me show you Plaintiff's 131.

04:50:51   18               Is this the letter that you wrote following the

04:50:55   19   event?

04:50:58   20   A.   Yes.

04:50:59   21   Q.   And who is the person at the top of the email string,

04:51:04   22   Lexie Burnham?

04:51:05   23   A.   Yes.    She was one of the organizer of the event.         Since

04:51:13   24   I don't have a -- Rohit Prasad email address, I sent email

04:51:24   25   to Lexie Burnham since I received the email from her.             And

04:51:29    1   I asked her to forward my letter -- the email to Rohit

04:51:40    2   Prasad.

04:51:40    3               MR. FABRICANT:   And if you scroll down to the

04:51:42    4   letter.

04:51:42    5   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)      Is this the letter that you wrote

04:51:43    6   to --

04:51:44    7   A.   Yes.

04:51:45    8   Q.   Rohit -- it goes on two pages.       What -- what was

04:51:51    9   your -- what you were trying to say Rohit Prasad in this

04:51:53   10   letter?

04:51:53   11   A.   As you can see, it's a very polite letter about the

04:51:57   12   information in the past -- okay.       Thank you.

04:52:08   13               And I told them that we attended their meeting in

04:52:12   14   November 20, 2014.     We saw their demo.      Not only myself but

04:52:21   15   also my colleague, Dr. Manli Zhu.        We observed that Echo

04:52:27   16   has a circular microphone array for sound source

04:52:30   17   localization and capturing far-field sound, and uses voice

04:52:35   18   to search music.

04:52:40   19               I told them we are R&D company that works on

04:52:44   20   acoustics, speech products, and microphone array research.

04:52:51   21   We have -- have a family of technology with circular --

04:53:37   10   Q.   So why were you telling him about the October 17th,

04:53:43   11   2011, meeting?

04:53:43   12   A.   I told him that we visited the Lab 126 in 2011, and we

04:53:49   13   demoed circular array and echo cancellation technology,

04:53:55   14   including both hardware and software at that time.

04:53:58   15   Q.   What are you telling him in the next paragraph?          "Our

04:54:03   16   company"...

04:54:03   17   A.   I told him our company holds several U.S. patents on

04:54:10   18   circular array systems and related technologies.

04:54:16   19   Q.   And what did you mean by:     We believe our patents and

04:54:21   20   technologies will be very useful to Amazon's business?

04:54:24   21   What did you mean by that?

04:54:25   22   A.   Because they already use our technology in the product.

04:54:33   23   Q.   What did you mean by:     To extend your patent portfolio

04:54:36   24   and to protect your products?

04:54:42    1   that is that they infringe our patent.

04:54:47    2   Q.   When you wrote, it is our belief that collaborations

04:54:50    3   are the best solutions to this matter, what did you mean by

04:54:53    4   that?

04:54:53    5   A.   Means we want a piece of this.

04:54:55    6   Q.   And then you asked him for a person -- an in-person

04:55:01    7   meeting -- to schedule an in-person meeting; is that true?

04:55:39   19   Q.   Oh, what did you do?

04:55:40   20   A.   We submitted a proposal online to Google.

04:55:47   21   Q.   And what -- what was the proposal?

04:55:51   22   A.   We wanted to give the right to Google to use the '756

04:55:57   23   patent.

04:58:42   19               What patent were you trying to get a reissue on?

04:58:46   20   A.   We tried to file a reissue patent for Patent '756.

04:58:56   21   Q.   Did you ever try to file a reissue on the '049 patent?

04:59:02   22   A.   No.

04:59:02   23   Q.   And what was your understanding as the applicant, the

04:59:06   24   inventor -- what were you trying to accomplish with this

04:59:10   25   new reissue of the '756?
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 121 of 156 PageID #: 18582
                                                                                    246



04:59:13    1   A.   We thought we were entitled to make our claim broader.

04:59:20    2   Q.   And what do you mean by broader?

04:59:23    3   A.   That means we can cover more than what we have

04:59:34    4   received.

04:59:36    5               MR. FABRICANT:   Can you bring up, please,

04:59:38    6   Plaintiff's Exhibit 1468?

04:59:40    7   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)      Is this the application for the

04:59:49    8   second reissue of the '756 patent, Doctor?

04:59:53    9   A.   Yes.

04:59:54   10               MR. FABRICANT:   If you'd scroll down to the

04:59:57   11   bottom, all the way down.       We're looking for Page 1 of 2.

05:00:21   12   That's not the page.      We need --

05:00:39   13               Your Honor, is it all right if I use the ELMO for

05:00:42   14   this, rather than hold up the jury?

05:00:44   15               THE COURT:   Yes, it is.

05:01:09   16   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)      So, Dr. Li, down at the very bottom

05:01:12   17   of this page, there's a reference to the U.S. 8,861,756.

05:01:18   18   Was that your '756 patent?

05:01:19   19   A.   Yes.

05:01:19   20   Q.   And it says:    That patent is broadened as explained in

05:01:26   21   the attached sheet.      Is that what you intended?

05:01:28   22   A.   Yes.

05:01:29   23   Q.   There -- there are boxes above that paragraph.          And the

05:01:34   24   second box, which is not checked, says:         By reason of the

05:01:38   25   patentee claiming more or less than he had the right to
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 122 of 156 PageID #: 18583
                                                                                    247



05:01:40    1   claim.

05:01:42    2               Do you know why that box has been checked?

05:01:46    3   A.   I'm sorry, I'm not an attorney.       I don't know why this

05:01:52    4   box was not checked, but the proposal of this reissue

05:02:00    5   application is to make the claim broader.

05:02:05    6   Q.   And it refers to an attached sheet at the very bottom

05:02:14    7   of this exhibit.      Do you see the reference?      I'm going to

05:02:19    8   show you the attached sheet that's referred to.

05:02:30    9               The last few words of the paragraph, the big

05:02:34   10   paragraph, says:      It is a broadening reissue.

05:02:38   11               Is that what you intended when you prepared the

05:02:41   12   attached sheet and submitted it to the Patent Office?

05:02:43   13   A.   Yes.

05:02:43   14   Q.   Did you intend anything else?

05:02:45   15   A.   That's it.

05:02:46   16   Q.   Did you intend to -- to intimate that this patent was

05:02:50   17   invalid?

05:02:52   18   A.   Could you repeat your question?

05:02:54   19   Q.   Did you intend to suggest that the patent was invalid?

05:02:58   20   A.   No.

05:02:58   21   Q.   Were you referring to the '049 patent at all?

05:03:01   22   A.   No.

05:03:10   23               MR. FABRICANT:   Your Honor, I pass the witness.

05:03:12   24               THE COURT:   Cross-examination?

05:03:18   25               MR. RE:   Yes, Your Honor.   Thank you.

05:03:29    1               MR. LAQUER:    May I approach?

05:03:33    2               THE COURT:    You may approach with binders.

05:04:08    3               MR. LAQUER:    Your Honor, may I approach one more

05:04:10    4   time to retrieve a physical?

05:04:12    5               THE COURT:    To retrieve what?

05:04:15    6               MR. LAQUER:    The physical exhibit that is --

05:04:19    7               THE COURT:    Oh, yes, you may approach the witness.

05:04:26    8   The Court Security Officer will hand it to you.

05:04:28    9               All right.    Mr. Re, you may proceed with

05:04:31   10   cross-examination.

05:04:32   11               MR. RE:   Thank you, Your Honor.

05:04:33   12               And thank you.

05:04:33   13                             CROSS-EXAMINATION

05:04:35   14   BY MR. RE:

05:04:35   15   Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Li.

05:04:37   16   A.   Hi, Mr. Re.

05:04:39   17   Q.   How are you?     It's nice to see you in person.

05:04:42   18   A.   Yes.

05:04:42   19   Q.   It's better than Zoom, right?

05:04:45   20   A.   Right.

05:04:46   21   Q.   I understand that you met with Amazon, you said, in

05:04:49   22   October of 2011; is that right?

05:04:51   23   A.   That's right.

05:04:53   24   Q.   And the features that you discussed with them at the

05:04:58   25   meeting, if I understand, was the circular microphone
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 124 of 156 PageID #: 18585
                                                                                    249



05:05:04    1   array; is that right?

05:05:04    2   A.   Microphone array, including circular array.

05:05:07    3   Q.   Yes.     And also about -- you also went there to discuss

05:05:12    4   noise reduction, right?

05:05:12    5   A.   Yes.

05:05:15    6   Q.   And echo cancellation; is that right?

05:05:17    7   A.   Yes.

05:05:18    8   Q.   And sound source localization, right?

05:05:22    9   A.   Right.

05:05:24   10   Q.   Right.

05:05:26   11               MR. RE:   And if we can call up Exhibit 45.

05:05:29   12   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      I believe those are listed in your

05:05:32   13   presentation.      Is this the presentation you discussed with

05:05:34   14   counsel?

05:05:34   15   A.   Yes.

05:05:35   16   Q.   And these are the slides that you presented or sent to

05:05:44   17   Amazon on or about October 17th, 2011?

05:05:47   18   A.   Yes.

05:05:48   19   Q.   And let's take a look, particularly at the page that

05:05:51   20   actually discusses the subject matter relevant to your '049

05:05:55   21   patent.

05:05:55   22               MR. RE:   If we can go to Page 5, please.

05:05:58   23   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And these where you list your core

05:06:04   24   technologies?

05:06:04   25   A.   Yes.
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 125 of 156 PageID #: 18586
                                                                                    250



05:06:05    1   Q.   And is it your testimony you presented these

05:06:08    2   technologies to Amazon in October of 2011?

05:06:13    3   A.   Right.

05:06:17    4   Q.   Let's go through those one at a time, and I have those

05:06:20    5   blown up because I want to take some notes.

05:06:23    6               You recognize this coming from the top of Page 5

05:06:30    7   on your screen?

05:06:34    8   A.   Could you repeat your question?

05:06:36    9   Q.   You see how this is just a picture of the top of Page 5

05:06:39   10   from the exhibit you sent to Amazon after your meeting on

05:06:42   11   October 2011.     Do you see that?

05:06:44   12   A.   Yes.

05:06:44   13   Q.   And I want to break this down a little bit to see if we

05:06:49   14   can see a little more about these ideas.

05:06:51   15               Now, the first item on the list is microphone

05:06:55   16   array, linear, circular; do you see that?

05:06:57   17   A.   Yes.

05:06:57   18   Q.   And you did not invent the linear or circular

05:07:02   19   microphone array, correct?

05:07:07   20   A.   Right.

05:07:07   21   Q.   And you know that those are very well-known by the time

05:07:15   22   you came to Amazon in 2011, right?

05:07:17   23   A.   Linear array was very well-known.       Circular array,

05:07:25   24   there was no product.

05:07:26   25   Q.   Let me show you what's been previously marked as
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 126 of 156 PageID #: 18587
                                                                                    251



05:07:30    1   exhibit -- Defendants' Exhibit 51.

05:07:40    2                Are you familiar with exhibit -- Defendant's

05:07:43    3   Exhibit 51, this article by Jacek Dmochowski?

05:07:48    4   A.    Uh-huh.

05:07:50    5   Q.    You are?    You've seen this before?

05:07:53    6                THE COURT:   You'll have to answer out loud,

05:07:56    7   Dr. Li.       Non-verbalized answers won't work.     So say yes or

05:08:01    8   no.     Don't say uh-huh.

05:08:03    9   A.    Yes.

05:08:04   10   Q.    (By Mr. Re)    And you see that this article was first

05:08:08   11   published in May of 2007.       Do you see that?

05:08:11   12   A.    Yes.

05:08:11   13   Q.    And I'd like to show you Page 2 of this exhibit, and at

05:08:20   14   the bottom, beginning with circular arrays, do you see

05:08:22   15   that?

05:08:23   16   A.    Yeah.

05:08:23   17   Q.    And do you see where it states that circular arrays

05:08:29   18   offer some advantages over their linear counterparts?            Do

05:08:37   19   you see that?

05:08:37   20   A.    Yes.

05:08:38   21   Q.    And one of the advantages shown in this 2007 published

05:08:43   22   article is that a circular array provides spatial

05:08:49   23   discrimination over the entire 360 degree azimuth range.

05:08:55   24   Do you see that?

05:08:56   25   A.    Yes.
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 127 of 156 PageID #: 18588
                                                                                    252



05:08:56    1   Q.   And you understand 360 degree azimuth simply means

05:08:59    2   being able to go in all directions in the room, for

05:09:07    3   example, right?

05:09:07    4   A.   Yes.

05:09:07    5   Q.   And it continues that this is particularly important

05:09:10    6   for applications that require front-to-back signal

05:09:15    7   enhancement, such as teleconferencing.         Do you see that?

05:09:19    8   A.   Yes.

05:09:20    9   Q.   And in this article, it continues that another

05:09:25   10   advantage of a circular microphone array is that the

05:09:31   11   geometry, and I quote, circular array geometry allows for

05:09:38   12   more compact designs.     Do you see that?

05:09:40   13   A.   Yes.

05:09:40   14   Q.   And if we go further down the page, there's a picture

05:09:46   15   on Page 2, and I'd like to blow that up for you.

05:09:51   16               And you do see in that picture, sir, that there

05:09:59   17   are six microphones or sound sensors depicted in Figure 1

05:10:04   18   of this article?

05:10:06   19   A.   Right.

05:10:07   20   Q.   And this is looking down at a circular microphone array

05:10:12   21   from the top, right?

05:10:13   22   A.   Yes.

05:10:14   23   Q.   So you were clearly not the first inventor of a

05:10:22   24   circular microphone array, correct?

05:10:24   25   A.   Yes.
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 128 of 156 PageID #: 18589
                                                                                    253



05:10:26    1   Q.   So let's just -- let me write on the board here that

05:10:31    2   the microphone arrays, linear or circular, are known, okay?

05:10:42    3   A.   Right.

05:10:43    4   Q.   And when I say known, I mean publicly known because

05:10:56    5   they're in articles that are available to the public,

05:10:59    6   right?

05:10:59    7   A.   Individual technological component.

05:11:06    8   Q.   Yes.     And this component was shown in the article I

05:11:09    9   just showed to you from Dmochowski, right?

05:11:11   10   A.   Yes.

05:11:13   11   Q.   Okay.     Now, the next item I see on the -- on the board,

05:11:19   12   that is noise reduction.        Do you see that?    Do you see

05:11:28   13   noise reduction, do you see that --

05:11:32   14               MR. RE:     If we can call that up.

05:11:33   15   A.   There's nothing displayed on monitor.

05:11:37   16   Q.   (By Mr. Re)       Can you see this --

05:11:38   17   A.   Oh, yes, on the board, yes.

05:11:40   18   Q.   You can see this, right?

05:11:42   19   A.   Yes.

05:11:42   20   Q.   Okay.     If you can't see, let me know.      And if you can't

05:11:45   21   hear me, let me know, okay?

05:11:48   22               Okay.     Now, you did not invent noise reduction,

05:11:54   23   correct?

05:11:54   24   A.   Right.

05:11:55   25   Q.   And, in fact, that's been around a long time, right?

                                                                                    254



05:11:59    1   A.   Yeah.

05:12:01    2   Q.   And, in fact, you're familiar with this 2001 book by

05:12:10    3   Dr. Michael Brandstein, correct?

05:12:15    4   A.   Yes.

05:12:15    5   Q.   And this book is entitled Microphone Arrays, and I'm

05:12:22    6   holding up Defendants' Exhibit 71P?

05:12:26    7   A.   Yes.

05:12:27    8   Q.   And you knew about this book, right?

05:12:30    9   A.   I think one of the article from the book.

05:12:34   10   Q.   Yes.    But you knew about the book itself, didn't you?

05:12:37   11   A.   Yes.

05:12:40   12   Q.   Yes.

05:12:41   13               And at the bottom of the page of this book --

05:12:45   14   let's go -- open the book up, and if we can go in so

05:12:49   15   everyone can see, you see there's a copyright date in this

05:12:54   16   book?   If you'd like -- if you have any doubt about it, let

05:12:59   17   me know if you want to see it, but is it clear to you that

05:13:02   18   this book was published back in 2001.

05:13:06   19   A.   Yes.

05:13:06   20   Q.   And this book was published about 10 years before you

05:13:10   21   met with Amazon, right?

05:13:12   22   A.   Yes.

05:13:15   23   Q.   And you know that noise reduction is specifically

05:13:19   24   discussed in this book on microphone arrays, right?

05:13:29   25   A.   I don't remember I read that part of the book, but I

                                                                                    255



05:13:34    1   think it must discuss noise reduction when it talk about

05:13:39    2   microphone array.

05:13:39    3   Q.   Well, let's take a closer look.

05:13:42    4               MR. RE:    If we can go to Page 11 of the table of

05:13:46    5   contents of this book.

05:13:48    6   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Page 11 has a table of contents.      We can

05:13:53    7   see sections that are in this book specifically on noise

05:13:58    8   reduction with microphone arrays.        Do you see that?

05:14:00    9   A.   Yes.

05:14:02   10               MR. RE:    And let's go to Page 13 of this

05:14:05   11   Exhibit 49.

05:14:07   12   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And we can see in the table of contents in

05:14:10   13   Chapter 12 several more sections dealing with noise

05:14:14   14   reduction techniques.        Do you see that?

05:14:15   15   A.   Yes.

05:14:16   16   Q.   And we can see that Dr. Brandstein's Chapter 12 is all

05:14:25   17   about microphone arrays with -- and I quote, postfilters

05:14:31   18   for noise and acoustic echo reduction.          Do you see that?

05:14:36   19   A.   Yes.

05:14:36   20   Q.   And do you also see in Section 12.3, a reference to a

05:14:41   21   Wiener Filter.        Do you see that?

05:14:45   22   A.   Yes.

05:14:45   23   Q.   And that's a noise reduction algorithm, isn't it?

05:14:48   24   A.   Yes.

05:14:49   25   Q.   And that is the same exact noise reduction algorithm

                                                                                    256



05:14:54    1   that you describe using in your '049 patent, correct?

05:14:59    2   Wiener Filter?

05:15:01    3   A.   Can be one of the noise reduction algorithm.

05:15:06    4   Q.   Yes, and it's one of many different noise reduction

05:15:09    5   algorithms, isn't it?

05:15:11    6   A.   Yes.

05:15:11    7   Q.   And we can also see in the Brandstein table of contents

05:15:16    8   that Dr. Brandstein also discloses and discusses Wiener

05:15:20    9   Filters for noise reduction?

05:15:23   10               MR. RE:   If we can call that.

05:15:26   11   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And, in particular, Section 3.2 in the

05:15:30   12   chapter Post-filtering Techniques.        It's called

05:15:39   13   Multichannel Wiener Filtering in Sub-bands.          Do you see

05:15:44   14   that?

05:15:44   15   A.   Yes.

05:15:45   16   Q.   So it's pretty clear that you did not invent the idea

05:15:45   17   or technique of noise reduction with microphone arrays,

05:15:54   18   right?

05:15:54   19   A.   Right.

05:15:54   20   Q.   And you did not invent the specific noise reduction

05:15:57   21   algorithm used in your patent, such as the Wiener Filter,

05:16:03   22   right?

05:16:03   23   A.   No, no, I didn't invent the Wiener Filter.

05:16:07   24   Q.   You did not.      And that noise reduction algorithm was

05:16:10   25   obviously public knowledge well before 2011, right?

05:16:14    1   A.   Right.

05:16:15    2   Q.   Right.    So let's just go to the second item on the

05:16:18    3   board, and noise reduction, I'm going to list as known,

05:16:26    4   publicly known, okay?

05:16:40    5               Now let's discuss echo cancellation.

05:16:46    6               MR. RE:   Let's specifically go to your

05:16:48    7   presentation which is Plaintiff's Exhibit 45.8.           Thank you.

05:16:54    8   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      You -- you presented what you thought were

05:16:56    9   ideas about echo cancellation, right?

05:16:58   10   A.   I present idea of echo cancellation for the -- for the

05:17:05   11   device.

05:17:05   12   Q.   Yes.

05:17:06   13               And this is a page from your presentation on

05:17:10   14   Page 8, and the title of Page 8 is called Echo

05:17:15   15   Cancellation, right?

05:17:15   16   A.   Yes.

05:17:16   17   Q.   And you did not invent the idea of echo cancellation,

05:17:27   18   right?

05:17:27   19   A.   Right.

05:17:27   20   Q.   And echo cancellation has been described in basic

05:17:30   21   textbooks well before you filed for your '049 patent

05:17:36   22   application, right?

05:17:37   23   A.   Right.

05:17:38   24               MR. RE:   I'd like to show you if we can go back to

05:17:43   25   Exhibit 49, Page 14, Mr. Berk.
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 133 of 156 PageID #: 18594
                                                                                    258



05:17:47    1   Q.   (By Mr. Re)    We can see here that Dr. Brandstein's 2001

05:17:50    2   textbook had an entire chapter on acoustic echo

05:17:57    3   cancellation for beamforming microphone arrays.           Do you see

05:18:01    4   that?

05:18:01    5   A.   Yes.

05:18:01    6   Q.   So you did not invent using echo cancellation

05:18:12    7   techniques with a microphone array system, right?

05:18:15    8   A.   Right.

05:18:15    9   Q.   And that was public knowledge well before your 2011

05:18:20   10   meeting at Amazon, right?

05:18:23   11   A.   Yes.

05:18:23   12   Q.   Okay.    So I'm going to go to the board and just put

05:18:26   13   "known," for publicly known for echo cancellation using

05:18:31   14   microphone arrays.

05:18:32   15               Now I'd like to go to what you call one of your

05:18:47   16   core technologies, sound source localization.          You see

05:18:52   17   that's next on the board?

05:18:53   18   A.   Yes.

05:18:53   19   Q.   And turn to Page 9 of your presentation of Exhibit 45,

05:18:58   20   you have a page specific to sound source localization, and

05:19:02   21   I believe this was shown in your direct.         Do you see that?

05:19:06   22   A.   Yes.

05:19:06   23   Q.   And you did not invent the idea of sound source

05:19:12   24   localization using a microphone array, right?

05:19:15   25   A.   Right.
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 134 of 156 PageID #: 18595
                                                                                    259



05:19:15    1   Q.   In fact, sound source localization is well-known before

05:19:22    2   your meeting at Amazon, right?

05:19:25    3   A.   Right.

05:19:25    4   Q.   And, in fact, if we go to our book on Microphone

05:19:31    5   Arrays, you can see in Brandstein, there's an entire

05:19:35    6   chapter, the table of contents, discussing sound source

05:19:40    7   localization, right?

05:19:41    8   A.   Uh-huh.

05:19:42    9   Q.   And sound source localization is just figuring out the

05:19:44   10   direction the sound is coming from?

05:19:47   11   A.   Yes.

05:19:47   12   Q.   Or the -- or the location where the sound is coming

05:19:51   13   from?

05:19:51   14   A.   Yes.

05:19:52   15   Q.   So I know you're talking from over there because my

05:19:55   16   ears have some sound source localization capability?

05:20:00   17   A.   Right.

05:20:00   18   Q.   And so you did not invent sound source localization

05:20:07   19   using a microphone array system, right?

05:20:11   20   A.   Right.

05:20:11   21   Q.   And that was public knowledge well before 2011 when you

05:20:15   22   visited Amazon, right?

05:20:18   23   A.   Right.

05:20:19   24   Q.   And your -- your '049 patent, in fact, it uses a very

05:20:24   25   specific kind of sound source localization technique called

05:20:30    1   SRP-PHAT.     And PHAT is spelled P-H-A-T.      Correct?

05:20:37    2   A.   Did you display that on the screen?

05:20:40    3   Q.   Yes, I'd like to.

05:20:42    4               MR. RE:   It's Plaintiff's Exhibit 1, Page 42, at

05:20:45    5   Column 11, Lines 25 through 28.       If we can show that to

05:20:52    6   Dr. Li, Mr. Berk.       Column 11, Lines -- there we go.       You're

05:21:12    7   zoning in on it.       That's it.

05:21:15    8   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And do you see that your patent

05:21:18    9   specifically refers to this algorithm for sound source

05:21:24   10   localization?      Do you see that?

05:21:25   11   A.   Yes.

05:21:25   12   Q.   But you do know, sir, that Dr. Brandstein has a whole

05:21:37   13   section using the SRP-PHAT algorithm for sound source

05:21:44   14   localization in a microphone array system, right?

05:21:45   15   A.   Could you repeat your question?

05:21:52   16               MR. RE:   Let's show Mr. Brandstein --

05:21:55   17   Dr. Brandstein's 2001 textbook, specifically Section 8.3.5.

05:22:05   18   There we go.

05:22:06   19   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Looking at the screen, sir, isn't it clear

05:22:09   20   to you that the use of SRP-PHAT algorithm for sound source

05:22:15   21   localization techniques in a microphone array system was

05:22:17   22   well-known well before you visited Amazon?

05:22:21   23   A.   Yes.

05:22:24   24   Q.   And so I'll just go to my board again and write "known"

05:22:31   25   to signify that sound source localization was known --

                                                                                    261



05:22:37    1               THE COURT:   Mr. Re, you don't need to make

05:22:40    2   comments that aren't in the form of a question.           If you

05:22:42    3   want to ask him will he confirm if you write it on the

05:22:45    4   board, that's fine.       But if you're not asking a question,

05:22:49    5   you're engaged in a sidebar comment, and we don't need

05:22:53    6   that.

05:22:54    7               MR. RE:   You're right, Your Honor.     And I

05:22:55    8   apologize.

05:22:57    9   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      So you do agree that sound source

05:22:59   10   localization techniques using SRP-PHAT algorithms were

05:23:04   11   known, well before you visited Amazon in 2011, correct?

05:23:06   12   A.   Yes.

05:23:17   13   Q.   Now, the last item on your list I see is 3D sound.            Do

05:23:23   14   you see that?

05:23:24   15   A.   Yes.

05:23:24   16   Q.   But I noticed your attorney in opening statement, he

05:23:27   17   didn't highlight that feature because that feature is not

05:23:30   18   really at issue in this case, right?

05:23:31   19   A.   Right.    That's -- that's not included in the pat -- the

05:23:36   20   '049 patent.

05:23:36   21   Q.   Right.    So we will -- is it all right if I just cross

05:23:40   22   it off the list because that, you agree, is not at issue in

05:23:44   23   this case, right?

05:23:45   24   A.   Right.

05:23:45   25   Q.   Now, you also mentioned in your direct that you said or

                                                                                    262



05:24:04    1   discussed with Amazon in the 2011 meeting something you

05:24:09    2   called adaptive beamforming; isn't that right?

05:24:11    3   A.   Yes.

05:24:11    4   Q.   And so adaptive beamforming is another core technology

05:24:17    5   under the category of acoustic signal processing, that you

05:24:20    6   discussed at Amazon?

05:24:22    7   A.   Right.

05:24:22    8   Q.   So it could just as easily be on this list as another

05:24:26    9   core technology, right?

05:24:27   10   A.   Right.

05:24:28   11   Q.   Now -- but you did not invent adaptive beamforming for

05:24:54   12   use in a microphone array system, right?

05:24:56   13   A.   We did develop adaptive beamforming algorithm.          We

05:25:09   14   worked together with all this technology components.

05:25:12   15   Q.   But my -- my question, sir, was, but adaptive

05:25:16   16   beamforming for use in a microphone array system was

05:25:19   17   well-known before you met with Amazon in 2011, right?

05:25:27   18   A.   I know the term of adaptive beamforming was available

05:25:32   19   before my visit.

05:25:35   20   Q.   Just the term?

05:25:36   21   A.   The technology, but I don't know -- adaptive

05:25:44   22   beamforming -- you're talking about adaptive beamforming

05:25:46   23   and the microphone array together, right?

05:25:49   24   Q.   Well, let me see if I can --

05:25:51   25   A.   Well, you asked me the question.       I heard that you
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 138 of 156 PageID #: 18599
                                                                                    263



05:25:54    1   said --

05:25:55    2   Q.   Yes --

05:25:55    3   A.   Adaptive beamforming for microphone array.

05:25:58    4   Q.   Yes.     Adaptive beamforming for microphone arrays, that

05:26:03    5   was well-known before you came to Amazon, right?

05:26:05    6   A.   I told you that we developed implementation -- an

05:26:15    7   algorithm, an algorithm for adaptive beamforming for

05:26:18    8   microphone array.

05:26:18    9   Q.   Okay.     And using adaptive beamforming for microphone

05:26:22   10   arrays was well-known, right?

05:26:26   11   A.   I don't know if it's well-known or not well-known.

05:26:32   12   Even adaptive beamforming can have a different kind of

05:26:34   13   implementation under the same title.

05:26:38   14   Q.   Okay.     Let's take a look at Dr. Brandstein's book.

05:26:46   15               MR. RE:   And if we could go to Chapter 5.

05:26:50   16   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And you see he has an entire chapter on

05:26:55   17   robust adaptive beamforming in his book on microphones

05:26:58   18   already?

05:26:58   19   A.   Uh-huh.

05:26:59   20   Q.   Do you see that?

05:27:00   21   A.   Uh-huh.

05:27:01   22               THE COURT:   Again, Dr. Li, you're going to have to

05:27:04   23   answer out loud yes or no.       Non-verbalized answers like

05:27:08   24   "uh-huh" are not clear in the record.         So, please, try to

05:27:11   25   give us a verbalized answer, okay?

05:27:16    1               THE WITNESS:     I'm sorry, Your Honor.

05:27:17    2               THE COURT:     That's all right.

05:27:18    3               Let's proceed.

05:27:19    4   Q.   (By Mr. Re)    So we can agree that using adaptive

05:27:22    5   beamforming in microphone arrays is well-known?           It's in

05:27:27    6   Dr. Brandstein's book 10 years before you visited Amazon,

05:27:30    7   right?

05:27:30    8   A.   Under this subject, under their publication, this

05:27:37    9   publication is well-known.

05:27:40   10   Q.   Yes, and this was a published book that anyone could

05:27:43   11   buy in the early 2000s, right?

05:27:44   12   A.   Yeah, whatever in the book is --

05:27:53   13   Q.   Thank you.

05:27:54   14   A.   -- is known.

05:27:56   15   Q.   In your presentation at Amazon and in your testimony

05:28:08   16   today, you also referred to the use of a digital signal

05:28:13   17   processor, or DSP.       Do you remember that?

05:28:17   18   A.   That right here, the DSP means digital signal

05:28:30   19   processing.

05:28:30   20   Q.   Yes.

05:28:31   21   A.   And an implementation, for example, on the products are

05:28:35   22   ARM chip, and ARM chip can be implemented as a digital

05:28:41   23   signal processor.

05:28:41   24   Q.   Right.    And one of the items on this page entitled Core

05:28:49   25   Technologies specifically mentions DSP-based hardware
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 140 of 156 PageID #: 18601
                                                                                    265



05:28:53    1   development.     Do you see that?

05:28:56    2   A.   Yes.

05:28:57    3   Q.   But -- and so did you remember actually discussing with

05:29:04    4   Amazon your ideas about using a digital signal processor?

05:29:09    5   A.   Yes, we did, and I think we also showed demo --

05:29:16    6   Q.   Okay.

05:29:16    7   A.   -- using hardware, using microprocessor to -- to be

05:29:28    8   implemented -- for digital signal processing.

05:29:39    9   Q.   But you did not invent the digital signal processor,

05:29:43   10   right?

05:29:43   11   A.   No.

05:29:44   12   Q.   And you did not invent the idea of using a digital

05:29:50   13   signal processor with a microphone array, right?

05:29:52   14   A.   No.

05:29:52   15   Q.   And digital signal processors for use in microphone

05:30:01   16   arrays is also well-known, right?

05:30:06   17   A.   Yes.

05:30:08   18               MR. RE:   And if I can go to Dr. Brandstein's book

05:30:12   19   on microphone arrays, in particular, Section 5.6.

05:30:19   20   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      It's -- first sentence in Section 5.6.1,

05:30:26   21   implementation of hardware evaluation of a robust adaptive

05:30:27   22   microphone array, he specifically points out that it can be

05:30:34   23   implemented on a portable and flexible DSP system.            Do you

05:30:38   24   see that?

05:30:39   25   A.   Yes.

05:30:39    1   Q.   So using DSPs for microphone arrays was publicly known,

05:30:43    2   at least by 2001, about 10 years before you visited Amazon,

05:30:50    3   right?

05:30:50    4   A.   Here, right.

05:30:56    5   Q.   Okay.   So you agree with my board that these items,

05:31:11    6   these ideas for use in a microphone array, were known well

05:31:17    7   before you came to Amazon in 2011, correct?

05:31:22    8   A.   This technology titles.

05:31:35    9   Q.   And you were here, these -- these titles you said, you

05:31:38   10   call them titles?      It's concepts, right, you were here for

05:31:42   11   opening statements, right?

05:31:43   12   A.   Can you repeat your question?

05:31:45   13   Q.   I want to show you what your counsel showed the jury

05:31:49   14   earlier today.      It was a Slide 18.    Do you remember this?

05:31:52   15   A.   Yes.

05:31:55   16   Q.   And your counsel said that -- that you and Vocalife

05:32:03   17   will show infringement, that my client uses what is in the

05:32:08   18   patent, as shown on Slide 18 during the opening statement.

05:32:14   19   Do you remember that?

05:32:15   20   A.   Yes.

05:32:17   21   Q.   And you agree with what your counsel said with regard

05:32:20   22   to your patent, which is PTX-1, and you agree with this

05:32:25   23   listing?

05:32:27   24   A.   That's -- our claim include all of this technology

05:32:31   25   components.
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 142 of 156 PageID #: 18603
                                                                                    267



05:32:33    1   Q.   Yes.     And the components that was on the Slide 18

05:32:38    2   includes No. 1, microphone array, right?

05:32:42    3   A.   Right.

05:32:44    4   Q.   Right.     It also includes sound source localization,

05:32:52    5   right?

05:32:52    6   A.   Yes.

05:32:54    7   Q.   Adaptive beamforming unit, right?

05:32:57    8   A.   Right.

05:33:00    9   Q.   Noise reduction unit, right?

05:33:04   10   A.   Yes.

05:33:07   11   Q.   And in a digital signal processor, right?

05:33:15   12   A.   Right.

05:33:15   13   Q.   And you have agreed with me that the titles or concepts

05:33:27   14   shown on Slide 18 were well-known before you visited Amazon

05:33:32   15   in 2011, correct?

05:33:37   16   A.   These are title of components, yes.

05:33:39   17   Q.   Yes.     You also tried to get patents on these features

05:33:52   18   well before the filing of this provisional application that

05:33:57   19   Mr. Fabricant discussed with you, filed in September of

05:33:59   20   2010, right?

05:34:00   21   A.   Could you talk close -- closer to the microphone?

05:34:04   22   That's a close-talking microphone.

05:34:07   23   Q.   It's not far-field, right?

05:34:08   24   A.   Not far-field.

05:34:10   25   Q.   Okay.     You -- if I -- if I understand the evidence
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 143 of 156 PageID #: 18604
                                                                                    268



05:34:14    1   correctly, you sought to patent many of these concepts or

05:34:21    2   technologies, as you call them, before you filed your

05:34:27    3   September 2010 provisional, right?

05:34:29    4   A.   Yes.

05:34:34    5   Q.   And let's go through some of those quickly.          And I

05:34:37    6   first want to show you what's been marked as Defendant's

05:34:41    7   Exhibit 954.

05:34:53    8               And this is a 2006 publication of one of your

05:34:57    9   patent applications, right?

05:34:58   10   A.   Yes.

05:34:58   11   Q.   And you filed this application on August 9th, 2005,

05:35:02   12   right?

05:35:02   13   A.   Yes.

05:35:05   14   Q.   And as you can see, the Patent Office published it on

05:35:10   15   February 9th, 2006?

05:35:12   16   A.   Yes.

05:35:13   17   Q.   And you are listed as the sole inventor, right?

05:35:16   18   A.   Yes.

05:35:17   19   Q.   And I'd like to show you Figure 1 of this.         And if we

05:35:28   20   look at Figure 1, we can see that this application included

05:35:31   21   a microphone array.     You see that?

05:35:32   22   A.   Yes.

05:35:32   23   Q.   A digital signal processor?

05:35:34   24   A.   Yes.

05:35:35   25   Q.   And a noise reduction unit, correct?
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 144 of 156 PageID #: 18605
                                                                                    269



05:35:40    1   A.   Right.

05:35:41    2   Q.   And in Paragraph 17 of this 2006 publication, it

05:35:52    3   describes an adaptive beamforming unit that steers the beam

05:35:59    4   in the direction of the sound -- the direction of the

05:36:01    5   source of the sound.       Do you see that?

05:36:03    6   A.   Could you highlight that part?

05:36:05    7   Q.   Yes.

05:36:07    8               MR. RE:   Let's highlight the first five lines all

05:36:09    9   the way to speaker's mouth.

05:36:15   10   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And I'll read it into the record if that

05:36:17   11   will speed things along.

05:36:19   12               Moreover, because of the microphone array consists

05:36:21   13   of a set of microphones that are spatially distributed at

05:36:25   14   known locations with reference to a common point, the

05:36:28   15   invention can implement an array signal processing

05:36:31   16   algorithm, by weighting the microphone outputs, and an

05:36:36   17   acoustic beam can be formed and steered along some

05:36:43   18   specified directions of the source of the sound, e.g.,

05:36:50   19   speaker's mouth.

05:36:51   20               Did I read it correctly into the record?

05:36:54   21   A.   Yes.

05:36:54   22   Q.   And this was your published application.         You disclosed

05:36:58   23   this to the world in 2006; isn't that right?

05:37:01   24   A.   Yes.

05:37:07   25   Q.   And the device of this patent application also includes

                                                                                    270



05:37:10    1   a noise reduction unit, doesn't it?

05:37:13    2   A.    Could you highlight that part?

05:37:15    3   Q.    Do you recall?

05:37:18    4   A.    Could you highlight that part?

05:37:20    5   Q.    But do you recall, as you sit here, or do you need me

05:37:25    6   to go through it line-by-line?

05:37:28    7   A.    You said do I remember whether I put noise reduction

05:37:32    8   in.    I may have put in noise reduction.

05:37:34    9   Q.    You're correct.      Let's take a look at that.

05:37:37   10                MR. RE:   Paragraph 19 of this document.

05:37:41   11   Q.    (By Mr. Re)      Do you see in the first sentence of

05:37:43   12   Paragraph 19, you specifically refer to noise reduction and

05:37:48   13   speech enhancement unit Step 30.        Do you see that?

05:37:54   14   A.    Yes.

05:37:54   15   Q.    And, specifically, it's describing that the noise

05:38:01   16   reduction unit may be a Wiener Filter, correct?

05:38:04   17   A.    Yes.

05:38:04   18   Q.    So from this examination, isn't it clear to you that

05:38:10   19   your 2005 patent application, which published in 2006,

05:38:14   20   included a device with a microphone array, sound source

05:38:21   21   localization, adaptive beamforming, a noise reduction unit

05:38:25   22   using a DSP.      Correct?

05:38:29   23   A.    I don't remember -- sound source localization.

05:38:34   24   Q.    You don't remember when I was --

05:38:35   25   A.    No, no, on this -- could you highlight?

                                                                                    271



05:38:48    1   Q.   We'll move along.

05:38:49    2            And this patent application --

05:38:51    3   A.   Sorry.

05:38:53    4   Q.   This patent --

05:38:54    5   A.   No, no, no.    I asked a question.     Could you highlight

05:38:59    6   that part?

05:38:59    7            THE COURT:     Dr. Li, you don't get to ask

05:39:01    8   questions.    He asks questions.

05:39:04    9            THE WITNESS:       Sure.

05:39:04   10            THE COURT:     And then Mr. Fabricant is going to get

05:39:06   11   an opportunity to ask more questions.         So either answer the

05:39:09   12   question or tell the attorney you don't understand, but you

05:39:14   13   don't get to ask questions at this point.

05:39:16   14            THE WITNESS:       Okay.

05:39:17   15            THE COURT:     All right.    Let's continue, Mr. Re.

05:39:21   16   Q.   (By Mr. Re)    This application was rejected by the

05:39:25   17   Patent Office.     Do you remember that?

05:39:25   18   A.   Again, I'm sorry, Mr. Re.       Could you talk in the front

05:39:30   19   of the microphone, please?

05:39:31   20   Q.   I'm sorry.    I am sorry.

05:39:33   21            THE COURT:     I think he's used to Mr. Fabricant's

05:39:35   22   voice.   The volume of it anyway.

05:39:41   23            MR. RE:    Okay.

05:39:42   24   Q.   (By Mr. Re)    You know, sir, of course, that this patent

05:39:48   25   application was rejected by the Patent Office because the
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 147 of 156 PageID #: 18608
                                                                                    272



05:39:51    1   features in this patent were already known, correct?

05:39:58    2   A.   I know that was a reject, but I don't know the reason

05:40:04    3   you explained.        Is that an official explanation from the

05:40:10    4   Patent Office?

05:40:11    5   Q.   Yes.    Want to take a look at that.

05:40:15    6               MR. RE:    Let's take a look at DTX-957.

05:40:20    7   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Maybe this will refresh your recollection.

05:40:23    8               MR. RE:    Specifically, Page 41.

05:40:27    9   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And do you see that all the claims were

05:40:29   10   rejected, 1 through 11, of this patent application?            You

05:40:32   11   know that, right?

05:40:33   12   A.   It's on there.

05:40:37   13   Q.   Okay.    And you abandoned this application.       You know

05:40:41   14   that, right?

05:40:42   15   A.   Yes.

05:40:42   16   Q.   Which means it was published and goes to the public

05:40:46   17   domain.      Do you know what that means?

05:40:49   18   A.   Yes.

05:40:49   19   Q.   Okay.    And you don't -- you seem not to recall the

05:41:01   20   reason why it was rejected.        Do you recall why?

05:41:04   21   A.   I don't remember why, but you point out that this claim

05:41:16   22   has been reject, so -- as this claim -- claim number,

05:41:20   23   right.

05:41:20   24   Q.   Let me show you the reasoning for the rejection.

05:41:26   25               MR. RE:    If I can go to --
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 148 of 156 PageID #: 18609
                                                                                    273



05:41:27    1               THE COURT:   Mr. Re, let me show you the reasons

05:41:30    2   for the rejection, is a sidebar comment.         You're testifying

05:41:33    3   to the jury.     Ask the witness a question.

05:41:37    4   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Isn't it true that this was rejected

05:41:40    5   because the prior art rendered the claims obvious?

05:41:47    6   A.   I -- I think so.

05:41:50    7   Q.   Yes.    And isn't it specifically rejected for

05:41:54    8   obviousness over the prior art?

05:42:00    9   A.   Again, I didn't read it.      As what you told me -- but

05:42:06   10   the patent opinion, if it rejects, must have some reason.

05:42:12   11               MR. RE:   And, Mr. Berk, can we show the reason?

05:42:19   12   Paragraph 9, the first paragraph.        You see 9, just

05:42:24   13   highlight that.

05:42:25   14   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Do you understand, Dr. Li, that the claims

05:42:29   15   stood rejected because they were unpatentable over prior

05:42:34   16   art for obviousness, Section 103?

05:42:39   17   A.   I saw that.

05:42:48   18   Q.   Okay.    Let's go to another application.

05:42:51   19               MR. RE:   Let's go to Defendants' Exhibit 956.

05:42:56   20   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Is this another one of your patent

05:42:58   21   applications?

05:43:01   22   A.   Yes.

05:43:01   23   Q.   And did this application -- did you file this on

05:43:05   24   September 9th, 2005?

05:43:08   25   A.   Yes.
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 149 of 156 PageID #: 18610
                                                                                    274



05:43:10    1   Q.   And you allowed this to publish on March 15th, 2007,

05:43:16    2   correct?

05:43:16    3   A.   Yes.

05:43:17    4   Q.   And you are listed as an inventor on this application,

05:43:25    5   right?

05:43:25    6   A.   Correct.

05:43:25    7   Q.   And I'd like to show you Figure 2 of this application.

05:43:33    8               And in Figure 2, isn't it true that the device in

05:43:36    9   this patent application included a microphone device, a

05:43:41   10   digital signal processor, and a noise reduction unit?

05:43:45   11   A.   Yes.

05:43:47   12   Q.   And doesn't this application also explain that the

05:44:03   13   adaptive beamforming unit steers the beam in the direction

05:44:06   14   of the source of the sound?

05:44:06   15   A.   I didn't see that word "adaptive beamforming" from this

05:44:13   16   picture.

05:44:14   17               MR. RE:   Let's go to Paragraph 16 of this

05:44:20   18   publication.

05:44:21   19   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And Paragraph 16 -- from reading Paragraph

05:44:28   20   16, and I'll highlight portions to help you, can you see

05:44:31   21   that it discloses an acoustic beam that can be formed and

05:44:35   22   steered in the directions of the source of the sound?

05:44:41   23   A.   Yes.

05:44:42   24   Q.   And if you look lower on the paragraph, do you

05:44:53   25   recognize that your application also discloses to the world
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 150 of 156 PageID #: 18611
                                                                                    275



05:44:56    1   that the microphone array can find the source of the sound

05:44:59    2   and can follow the sound's location by an adaptive

05:45:04    3   algorithm?     Do you see that?

05:45:06    4   A.   Yes.

05:45:08    5   Q.   And so this application disclosed to the world the use

05:45:14    6   of an adaptive beamforming capability, right?

05:45:18    7   A.   No, not the same meaning.

05:45:19    8   Q.   So the meaning of the word "adaptive beamformer" can

05:45:22    9   have different meanings depending on the document and

05:45:25   10   usage?

05:45:26   11   A.   Here it -- it did not talk about adaptive beamforming.

05:45:37   12   Q.   Okay.   And -- but it is talking about an acoustic beam

05:45:49   13   that can be formed and steered to the direction of the

05:45:51   14   source of the sound, right?

05:45:52   15   A.   You're pointing out somewhere from this patent

05:45:58   16   application?

05:45:58   17   Q.   Right, what's highlighted at the top.        It's an acoustic

05:46:03   18   beam can be formed and steered, right?

05:46:05   19   A.   Yes.

05:46:07   20   Q.   And if we go to the next paragraph, this application

05:46:13   21   also discloses a noise reduction unit, correct?

05:46:26   22   A.   Yes.

05:46:26   23   Q.   And isn't it true that this patent application was also

05:46:31   24   rejected by the Patent Office because the claims were

05:46:34   25   obvious in view of the prior art?
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 151 of 156 PageID #: 18612
                                                                                    276



05:46:38    1   A.   This application was reject.

05:46:44    2   Q.   Yes.     And, in fact, each and every claim of this

05:46:48    3   application was rejected in a final Office Action, right?

05:46:53    4   A.   I don't remember, but you tell me.        I guess, yes.

05:47:02    5               MR. RE:   If we can call up, to complete this,

05:47:06    6   Defendants' Exhibit 959, Page 4, the Disposition of Claims.

05:47:18    7   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Dr. Li, does this confirm in your mind

05:47:21    8   that each and every claim of this application was rejected

05:47:23    9   by the Patent Office in view of the prior art?

05:47:24   10   A.   Where is the numbers -- Claim 6?

05:47:36   11   Q.   6 does not appear to be pending, so there's no

05:47:39   12   rejection of a non-pending claim.         Do you see that?

05:47:43   13               MR. RE:   If we go to -- you can highlight.

05:47:46   14   A.   I see -- I see 1 through 5, 7 through 19 were rejected.

05:47:52   15   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Correct.   Okay.   And isn't it true that

05:48:00   16   you abandoned this application, as well, right?

05:48:03   17   A.   Yes.

05:48:03   18   Q.   So as of -- at this time, you knew you could not get a

05:48:11   19   patent on the features we just discussed in these last two

05:48:14   20   patent applications, right?

05:48:16   21   A.   Right.

05:48:17   22   Q.   Let's go to another patent application.

05:48:20   23               MR. RE:   If we can go to Defendants' Exhibit 955.

05:48:33   24   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      Do you recall filing this patent

05:48:35   25   application on May 21, 2006?
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 152 of 156 PageID #: 18613
                                                                                    277



05:48:38    1   A.   Yes.

05:48:38    2   Q.   And do you recall that this was published to the world

05:48:42    3   on November 30th, 2006?

05:48:45    4   A.   Yes.

05:48:46    5   Q.   And you are listed as the sole inventor on this

05:48:50    6   application, right?

05:48:52    7   A.   Right.

05:48:55    8   Q.   And I want to show you what you tried to claim in this

05:49:01    9   application.

05:49:01   10               MR. RE:   If we can go to Claim 4 of this

05:49:04   11   application.

05:49:11   12   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      And do you see in this claim you wrote --

05:49:16   13               MR. RE:   If we can just highlight.

05:49:18   14   Q.   (By Mr. Re)      You wrote:   The surface constructed by the

05:49:22   15   points of microphone components of the microphone array can

05:49:25   16   be in any geometry shape, such as a sphere, a half sphere,

05:49:31   17   partial sphere, circle, et cetera, and that it is not

05:49:36   18   necessary to be in a flat plane.

05:49:39   19               Right?

05:49:39   20   A.   Yes.

05:49:40   21   Q.   And so here's an application where you are disclosing

05:49:43   22   at least a circular microphone array, right?

05:49:46   23   A.   Yes.

05:49:49   24               THE COURT:   Mr. Re, let me ask you, what do you

05:49:52   25   anticipate the remainder of your cross-examination to be?
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 153 of 156 PageID #: 18614
                                                                                    278



05:49:55    1   Just an estimate, time-wise.

05:49:59    2           MR. RE:    Well into tomorrow, and I have --

05:50:02    3           THE COURT:     That's what I'm trying to determine.

05:50:04    4   What is "well into tomorrow"?

05:50:06    5           MR. RE:    At least -- at least another hour-plus.

05:50:09    6           THE COURT:     Okay.   Then, with that, we'll use this

05:50:12    7   point -- there's not a perfect point.         But we'll use this

05:50:15    8   point to break for the day.

05:50:17    9           Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm going to ask

05:50:20   10   you when you leave in a few minutes, if you'll make sure

05:50:23   11   you take your notebooks with you and leave them closed on

05:50:26   12   the table in the jury room.

05:50:28   13           I'll remind you that we're going to do our best to

05:50:31   14   start at 8:30 in the morning.       So please plan your travel

05:50:34   15   so that you can be assembled and in the jury room a little

05:50:39   16   bit before 8:30 and ready to go.

05:50:41   17           Please follow all the instructions I've given you,

05:50:44   18   including, of course, not to discuss the case with anyone

05:50:49   19   or among yourselves.

05:50:50   20           And I promise you, when you get home tonight,

05:50:53   21   unless you live alone, you're going to get a question as

05:50:55   22   soon as you walk through that door.        Just tell whoever asks

05:50:58   23   that question, you're not even going to try to answer it,

05:51:04   24   based on my instructions to you.

05:51:06   25           Please travel safely to your homes.           We'll see you
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 154 of 156 PageID #: 18615
                                                                                    279



05:51:10    1   in the morning.     With those instructions, we're excused for

05:51:13    2   the evening.

05:51:14    3             COURT SECURITY OFFICER:       All rise.

05:51:16    4             (Jury out.)

05:51:16    5             THE COURT:     Please be seated.

05:51:40    6             You may step down, Dr. Li.       You may step down,

05:51:46    7   Dr. Li.     You can return to the counsel table.

05:51:51    8             THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

05:51:52    9             THE COURT:     Counsel, let me remind you that before

05:51:54   10   I bring in the jury in the morning, as I indicated during

05:51:58   11   the pre-trial conferences, I will expect both sides to have

05:52:01   12   someone prepared to go to the podium and read into the

05:52:04   13   record those items from the list of pre-admitted exhibits

05:52:07   14   that have been used during today's portion of the trial.

05:52:11   15             Also, let me remind you of your continuing and

05:52:17   16   strenuous obligation to meet and confer regarding any

05:52:21   17   possible disputes that might arise with regard to

05:52:25   18   demonstratives or other issues that would be used during

05:52:27   19   tomorrow's portion of the trial.

05:52:30   20             In the event that there are disputes that cannot

05:52:33   21   be resolved, then we'll follow the process that I described

05:52:37   22   in pre-trial.     I'll look for a notebook delivered to

05:52:40   23   chambers by 7:00 o'clock, after a 10:00 o'clock email

05:52:45   24   briefing.     That notebook should have whatever is a

05:52:48   25   surviving dispute in it, outlined with a succinct paragraph
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 155 of 156 PageID #: 18616
                                                                                    280



05:52:53    1   from each party stating your position on whatever the

05:52:56    2   dispute is.

05:52:56    3           And then I'll be prepared and in chambers not

05:53:00    4   later than 7:30 so that I can meet with you and give you

05:53:04    5   guidance, again, all for the purpose of maximizing your

05:53:06    6   usable trial time that's been designated.

05:53:09    7           All right.     Are there questions from either party

05:53:13    8   before we recess for the evening?

05:53:15    9           MS. TRUELOVE:     Nothing from Plaintiff, Your Honor.

05:53:17   10           MR. DACUS:     Just one thing, Your Honor, and it

05:53:20   11   probably falls in the category of lawyers saying things

05:53:23   12   that they don't need to say, but --

05:53:24   13           THE COURT:     That's a big category, Mr. Dacus.

05:53:27   14           MR. DACUS:     They say them anyway to make

05:53:27   15   themselves and others around them feel good.          But it's been

05:53:28   16   my understanding that the Court's practice is for the

05:53:31   17   witness whose examination is continuing the next day, not

05:53:34   18   to consult with his lawyers related to the testimony.

05:53:38   19           THE COURT:     That's the Court's practice.

05:53:41   20           MR. DACUS:     I've said it.     I'll sit down.      Thank

05:53:44   21   you.

05:53:44   22           THE COURT:     All right.     One other thing, let me

05:53:47   23   say, I have no problem with counsel using boards or using

05:53:51   24   the easel.    But Mr. Fabricant has had the podium between

05:53:56   25   the easel and himself the entire time.         We need to make
   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 156 of 156 PageID #: 18617
                                                                                    281



05:53:56    1   sure the easel is used so opposing counsel at least has an

05:54:01    2   opportunity to see it.

05:54:02    3              And it's clear, Dr. Re [sic], as was mentioned in

05:54:07    4   the early part of the direct, has a hearing problem.            So I

05:54:08    5   think it behooves all of us to raise our volume as best we

05:54:14    6   can.

05:54:14    7              Okay.   So if there's not anything further, we

05:54:16    8   stand in recess.

05:54:18    9              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:     All rise.

05:54:19   10              (Recess.)
