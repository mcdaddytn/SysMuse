11:18:03    1            MR. DACUS:     Okay.   Perfect.     Thank you very much.

11:18:04    2            And, Mr. Smith, let me -- let me ask you a

11:18:08    3   question.

11:18:09    4            That's No. 15.

11:18:13    5            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, sir.

11:18:14    6            MR. DACUS:     I know you've sat on a criminal jury,

11:18:17    7   right?

11:18:17    8            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, sir.

11:18:17    9            MR. DACUS:     Did y'all find that person -- that

11:18:19   10   Defendant guilty?

11:18:20   11            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, sir.

11:18:21   12            MR. DACUS:     Do you remember the Judge told you

11:18:24   13   that there was a presumption of innocence, just like what's

11:18:26   14   been talked about this morning?

11:18:28   15            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, sir.

11:18:28   16            MR. DACUS:     And so my assumption is the State

11:18:30   17   overcame that presumption of innocence by evidence, and

11:18:31   18   y'all were able to find the Defendant guilty; is that

11:18:33   19   right?

11:18:34   20            JUROR SMITH:     That's right.

11:18:34   21            MR. DACUS:     So you know firsthand that there's a

11:18:40   22   presumption but that can be overcome by evidence; you agree

11:18:42   23   with that?

11:18:43   24            JUROR SMITH:     Yes, I do.

11:18:43   25            MR. DACUS:     All right.     Thank you very much.

11:18:44    1            I'm going to sit down now because the Judge is

11:18:50    2   going to make me.     But before I do, I'm going to ask the

11:18:53    3   same question Ms. Truelove did.        And, that is, I've done

11:18:57    4   this long enough that I know I do not always ask all the

11:19:02    5   right questions.
