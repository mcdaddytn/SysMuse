03:23:10   21   folks bring stuff to us, technology to us, that has value,

03:23:15   22   that is something new, Amazon recognizes it, and many times

03:23:19   23   buys it.    But when you don't bring something new, they

03:23:22   24   don't.

03:23:23   25              Now, let me close by talking a little bit about

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 73 of 156 PageID #: 18534
                                                                                     198



03:23:27    1   this -- these damages issues.       And I'm --

03:23:30    2             THE COURT:   You have two minutes remaining.

03:23:31    3             MR. DACUS:   Thank you, Your Honor.

03:23:32    4             Amazon certainly does not believe they owe these

03:23:38    5   folks a dime because we don't -- we don't use the '049

03:23:41    6   patent.

03:23:42    7             But here's what I want to ask you to do when you

03:23:44    8   listen to the evidence about damages.         Often, damages can

03:23:47    9   tell you what lawsuits are really about.          And I know

03:23:52   10   they've stood up here and told you what -- what they want

03:23:54   11   you to believe it's about, but the damages portion can tell

03:23:58   12   you what it's really about.

03:23:59   13             And, also, when you're judging credibility, if you

03:24:03   14   listen to how they get to this $31 million ultimately, I

03:24:09   15   think that will tell you a lot about credibility not only

03:24:15   16   in the damages case but the entirety of the case.

03:24:16   17             Over the next week and a half, we're going to have

03:24:19   18   the opportunity to present evidence to you.           We certainly

03:24:22   19   look forward to that opportunity.        We'll have an

03:24:25   20   opportunity at the end to talk to you in closing.            Until

03:24:29   21   that time, I appreciate very much your attention this

03:24:32   22   afternoon, and look forward to the next week and a half.

03:24:34   23             Thank you, Your Honor.

03:24:37   24             THE COURT:   All right.     Ladies and gentlemen,

03:24:38   25   you've heard opening statements for counsel for -- from

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 74 of 156 PageID #: 18535
                                                                                     199



03:24:42    1   counsel for the parties.

03:24:44    2             Counsel, at this time, let me inquire, does either

03:24:46    3   party wish to invoke the Rule?

03:24:48    4             MS. TRUELOVE:    Plaintiff does, Your Honor.

03:24:49    5             MR. DACUS:   Defendant does, Your Honor.

03:24:52    6             THE COURT:   And am I correct in assuming that that

03:24:54    7   would exclude expert witnesses but apply to other

03:24:58    8   witnesses?

03:24:59    9             MS. TRUELOVE:    Yes, that's correct.

03:25:00   10             MR. DACUS:   Yes, Your Honor.

03:25:02   11             THE COURT:   All right.     Then the Rule has been

03:25:05   12   invoked, not including expert witnesses.

03:25:07   13             If you are a fact witness in this case and not an

03:25:13   14   expert witness, you are not permitted to remain in the

03:25:16   15   courtroom until the time you are called to testify.             Expert

03:25:19   16   witnesses are exempt from this application of the Rule and

03:25:23   17   may be present, as are corporate representatives.

03:25:25   18             All right.   At this point, ladies and gentlemen,

03:25:30   19   we're ready to proceed with the Plaintiff's case-in-chief

03:25:33   20   and hear from their first witness.

03:25:35   21             But before we do that, we're going to take a short

03:25:37   22   recess.   And this is one of those times when I'm going to

03:25:40   23   tell you -- I don't expect us to be out of the courtroom

03:25:45   24   very long, so you may simply close and leave your notebooks

03:25:49   25   in your chairs when you go to the jury room for recess.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 329 Filed 10/09/20 Page 75 of 156 PageID #: 18536
                                                                                     200



03:25:54    1              As you do, remember all the instructions I have

03:25:54    2   given you, including not to discuss the case among

03:25:55    3   yourselves, and I expect to be back in here in 10 or so

03:25:58    4   minutes.

03:25:58    5              So, with that, the jury is excused for recess.

03:26:01    6              COURT SECURITY OFFICER:      All rise.

03:26:02    7              (Jury out.)

03:26:03    8              THE COURT:    The Court stands in recess.

03:45:27    9              (Recess.)

03:45:30   10              (Jury out.)
