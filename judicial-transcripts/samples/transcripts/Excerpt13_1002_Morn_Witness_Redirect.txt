09:51:57   16   Q.   So doesn't the evidence suggest that if anyone is doing

09:52:00   17   any copying, it could not be Amazon copying you, correct?

09:52:07   18   A.   We're not talking about the enclosure.         The patent is

09:52:11   19   about the technology, right?

09:52:17   20   Q.   But you --

09:52:18   21   A.   By the way, we have a patent on the enclosure design,

09:52:26   22   as well.

09:52:26   23   Q.   But there's no doubt that this product could not be

09:52:31   24   copying the attributes of the shape or design or circular

09:52:35   25   array of this product that you did not introduce until

09:52:40    1   November of 2018, right?

09:52:41    2   A.   You mentioned the shape, right.

09:52:45    3               MR. RE:   Your Honor, I have no further questions.

09:52:47    4   I would just like to mark the board as exhibit --

09:52:51    5   Demonstrative Exhibit 2A.

09:52:54    6               THE COURT:   Duly noted.    That's fine.

09:52:57    7               Unless Mr. Fabricant is going to use that in

09:53:00    8   redirect, that board needs to come down.

09:53:03    9               MR. FABRICANT:   I'm not -- I'm not intending to.

09:53:04   10               THE COURT:   Then you need to take it down, Mr. Re.

09:53:06   11               MR. FABRICANT:   Well, actually I changed my mind,

09:53:09   12   Your Honor.     Could we leave it up for my redirect?

09:53:10   13               THE COURT:   Based on your change of mind, we'll

09:53:13   14   leave it up.

09:53:14   15               Let's proceed -- let's proceed with redirect,

09:53:16   16   Mr. Fabricant.

09:53:16   17               MR. FABRICANT:   Yes, Your Honor.

09:53:36   18               If we could bring up Plaintiff's Exhibit 1,

09:53:48   19   please.     If we could go to the claims in Plaintiff's

09:53:49   20   Exhibit 1.

09:53:49   21                            REDIRECT EXAMINATION

09:53:50   22   BY MR. FABRICANT:

09:53:50   23   Q.   This is your patent, is it not, the '049 patent,

09:53:52   24   Dr. Li?

09:53:53   25   A.   Yes.

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 330 Filed 10/09/20 Page 59 of 121 PageID #: 18676
                                                                                     340



09:53:53    1               MR. FABRICANT:   If we could look at Claim 1 at the

09:53:56    2   back of the '049 patent, and highlight the entire claim,

09:53:59    3   please.

09:53:59    4   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)      Dr. Li, while we have the board up,

09:54:06    5   before I ask for permission to take the board down --

09:54:09    6   A.   Right.


09:56:37    9   Q.   -- do you own anything?      Unless they're all combined

09:56:37   10   together working in the way you've claimed, do you own

09:56:38   11   anything?

09:56:38   12   A.   We own the whole thing combined together -- included

09:56:42   13   together.

09:56:42   14            MR. FABRICANT:     May I take the board down,

09:56:44   15   Your Honor?

09:56:44   16            THE COURT:    You may.

09:57:14   17   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)     Now, yesterday you were asked a

09:57:16   18   series of questions about old patent applications that you

09:57:18   19   filed.   Do you recall that you were asked that series of

09:57:25   20   questions, Dr. Li?

09:57:25   21   A.   Correct.

09:57:26   22            MR. FABRICANT:     So, first, if you could bring up

09:57:28   23   the 954 -- Defendants' 954.

09:57:44   24   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)     Now, you were asked questions --

09:57:46   25            MR. FABRICANT:     If we could go to --

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 330 Filed 10/09/20 Page 62 of 121 PageID #: 18679
                                                                                     343



09:57:48    1   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)     Well, first, we'll look at the

09:57:50    2   first page.     What is the title of this patent application

09:57:53    3   that you submitted to the United States Patent Office?

09:57:56    4   A.   It says:   Voice-Operated Remote Control for TV and

09:58:02    5   Electronic Systems.

09:58:04    6            MR. FABRICANT:     And now if we could go to Claim 1

09:58:07    7   of this patent application.



10:00:50   23   Q.   And this is an abandonment of an application that had

10:00:53   24   absolutely nothing to do with microphone arrays; isn't that

10:00:53   25   right?

    Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 330 Filed 10/09/20 Page 64 of 121 PageID #: 18681
                                                                                     345



10:00:56    1   A.   That's right.

10:00:58    2               MR. RE:    Leading.   Your Honor, objection;

10:01:00    3   leading.

10:01:01    4               THE COURT:    Sustained as to leading.

10:01:02    5   Q.   (By Mr. Fabricant)      What, Dr. Li, did this abandonment

10:01:05    6   of this particular application, set forth in the 959

10:01:10    7   Defendants' exhibit, have to do with microphone array '049

10:01:14    8   patent?

10:01:14    9   A.   No.

10:01:14   10   Q.   You were asked some questions about this Brandstein

10:01:47   11   book, that textbook?

10:01:50   12   A.   Right.

10:01:51   13   Q.   Do you recall those questions?

10:01:52   14   A.   Yes.
