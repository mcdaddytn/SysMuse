01:48:48   10   Q.   So the beam selector is determining once every 100

01:48:52   11   milliseconds which of the ABF output signals to select,

01:48:57   12   right?

01:48:57   13   A.   Yes.

01:48:57   14   Q.   So then, in your experiment, if a person moved from the

01:49:03   15   left side of the device to the right side of the device and

01:49:08   16   was speaking for a period longer than 100 milliseconds, you

01:49:13   17   would expect with 80 percent accuracy that the beam would

01:49:16   18   change from the beam on the left side of the device to the

01:49:19   19   beam on the right side of the device.         Correct?

01:49:21   20   A.   I say yes.

01:49:24   21   Q.   So when you say -- when you're saying CMD, it wasn't

01:49:29   22   CMD, it was SIMD, S-I-M-D, right?

01:49:35   23   A.   Yes.     Yes.

01:49:36   24   Q.   And that's the advanced SIMD extension also known as

01:49:41   25   Neon for the ARM processor, right?

01:51:03    1   years.

01:51:03    2   Q.   What's your understanding of what the company Amazon

01:51:15    3   Lab126 does?      What business is it in?

01:51:19    4   A.   Amazon Lab126 is a hardware research and development

01:51:27    5   center.     We build products like Echo products which are

01:51:36    6   sold under the brand of Amazon.

01:51:38    7   Q.   When you say you worked on the original Echo product,

01:51:43    8   did you call it the Echo, or did it have an internal code

01:51:46    9   name?

01:51:46   10   A.   It did have an internal code name.        There were at least

01:51:50   11   two code names, and the -- the name Echo was announced.

01:51:55   12   Q.   What were those code names?

01:51:56   13   A.   The first code name was Project D, D for Denver, and

01:52:09   14   subsequently, it was called Doppler.

01:52:12   15   Q.   So when the project was released as the Echo, did you

01:52:17   16   maintain that internal code name for the released product,

01:52:20   17   as well?

01:52:20   18   A.   Yes.
