Add data types to IT Activities.  On a high level, the current activities are
Calendar Event (perhaps break these into subcategories, internal meetings, calls, etc.)
Emails (can differentiate incoming and outgoing, and have default behavior)
Documents (can differentiate by document type, and apply filters, regex, conventions maybe to narrow further and apply logical defaults)

Data types to Add
LLM Chats (can have subcategories like General Research, Brief Assistant, etc.)
Relativity Sessions (see what data can be pulled from relativity or other e-discovery platforms)



Let's also have the ability to generate during the seeding process dependent on team members, matters, and tasks.  Rather than have the json configuration for IT Activities dictate specific activities, let's create random events within constraints defined in the file.
