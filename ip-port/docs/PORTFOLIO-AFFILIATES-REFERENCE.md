## Notes for Attorneys

1. **Search Methodology:** USPTO PatentsView API is queried using the assignee name variations listed above. Searches use case-insensitive pattern matching.

2. **Assignee Changes:** Some patents may show original assignee names (e.g., "Nicira, Inc.") even after acquisition. The portfolio analysis normalizes these to the parent affiliate for reporting purposes.

3. **Exclusions:** Patents assigned to LifeLock, NortonLifeLock, or Gen Digital are explicitly excluded as these remained with the consumer security division.

4. **Data Currency:** Patent data is refreshed from USPTO regularly. Patent counts are approximate and subject to change as new patents issue or expire.

5. **Questions:** Contact the IP team for any assignee name variations not captured in this list.
