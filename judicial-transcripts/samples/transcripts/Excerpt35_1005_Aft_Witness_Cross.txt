04:08:52   16            MR. LAMBRIANAKOS:     At this time, Your Honor,

04:08:54   17   Amazon requested that the courtroom be sealed because we're

04:08:56   18   about to get into some of the proprietary financial metrics

04:08:59   19   of Amazon.

04:09:02   20            THE COURT:    All right.     Based on the request of

04:09:03   21   counsel, I'll order the courtroom sealed at this time.

04:09:07   22            If you're present and not subject to the

04:09:09   23   protective order that's been entered in this case, you

04:09:12   24   should excuse yourselves until the courtroom is unsealed

04:09:15   25   and reopened.

04:09:28    1              And, counsel, I'll rely on you to look around the

04:09:34    2   room and make sure everyone that needs to comply has

04:09:38    3   complied.

04:09:38    4              All right.    The courtroom is sealed.

04:09:41    5              (Courtroom sealed.)

04:09:41    6              (This portion of the transcript is sealed

04:33:22    9              (Courtroom unsealed.)

04:33:22   10              THE COURT:    Please during recess follow all the

04:33:25   11   instructions I've given you, including not to discuss the

04:33:28   12   case among yourselves.      And we'll be back shortly to

04:33:33   13   continue with the Defendants' cross-examination of this

04:33:37   14   witness.

04:33:37   15              The jury is excused for recess at this time.

04:45:04    1            MR. DACUS:    Thank you.

04:45:05    2            THE COURT:    Are there binders to pass out?

04:45:10    3            MR. DACUS:    There are, Your Honor.       Thank you.

04:45:14    4            THE COURT:    While they're doing that, let's bring

04:45:15    5   in the jury, please, Mr. Mixon.

04:45:57   10   cross-examination.

04:45:57   11            MR. DACUS:    Thank you, Your Honor.

04:45:57   12                           CROSS-EXAMINATION

04:45:58   13   BY MR. DACUS:

04:45:58   14   Q.   Good afternoon, Mr. Ratliff.

04:46:00   15   A.   Good afternoon.

04:46:00   16   Q.   You're not here, sir, to tell this jury whether or not

04:46:05   17   Amazon infringes, correct?

04:46:06   18   A.   Correct.

04:46:06   19   Q.   Not here to tell this jury whether or not this patent

04:46:09   20   is valid, correct?

04:46:10   21   A.   Correct.

04:46:10   22   Q.   And, indeed, if this jury finds that, in fact, Amazon

04:46:16   23   does not infringe, that is, does not use this patent, then

04:46:19   24   damages are zero, correct?

04:46:21   25   A.   Correct.

   Case 2:19-cv-00123-JRG Document 333 Filed 10/09/20 Page 109 of 120 PageID #: 19155
                                                                                    819



04:46:21    1   Q.   Likewise, if the jury were to find that the patent is

04:46:26    2   invalid, then damages are zero, correct?

04:46:27    3   A.   Correct.

04:46:28    4   Q.   And if I understood you, in your calculation, you

04:46:31    5   assumed both that there was infringement and that the

04:46:35    6   patent was valid, fair?

04:46:36    7   A.   That's correct.
