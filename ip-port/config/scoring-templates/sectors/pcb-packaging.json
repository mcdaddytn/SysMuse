  "contextDescription": "PCB and packaging patents cover the physical assembly and interconnection of semiconductor devices. Key areas include PCB design (H05K), chip packaging (flip-chip, BGA, CSP), advanced packaging (2.5D, 3D, chiplets), and interconnects. High-value targets include OSAT vendors (ASE, Amkor), substrate suppliers, and advanced packaging leaders (TSMC CoWoS, Intel EMIB).",
