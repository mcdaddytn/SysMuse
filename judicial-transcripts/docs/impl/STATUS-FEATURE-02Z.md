# Feature 02Z Implementation Status

## Feature: Alternative Document Section Markers

**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED  
**Date**: 2025-09-11

## Summary
Implemented configurable alternative document section markers to handle transcripts that don't contain the standard "P R O C E E D I N G S" or "CERTIFICATION" markers.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Type Definition Update
- **File**: `src/types/config.types.ts`
- Added `sectionMarkers` field to `TrialStyleConfig` interface
- Supports configurable arrays for both `proceedings` and `certification` markers

### 2. Parser Updates
- **File**: `src/parsers/MultiPassStructureAnalyzer.ts`
- Modified to accept `trialStyleConfig` in constructor
- Updated section detection logic to check configured markers in order
- Falls back to standard patterns if no markers match

### 3. Configuration
- **File**: `config/trialstyle.json`
- Added default `sectionMarkers` configuration
- Proceedings markers include: "P R O C E E D I N G S", "COURT SECURITY OFFICER:", "THE COURT:", "LAW CLERK:", "(Jury out.)", "All rise", "Be seated, please"
- Certification markers include: "CERTIFICATION", "C E R T I F I C A T I O N", "I HEREBY CERTIFY", "CERTIFY THAT THE FOREGOING", "CERTIFICATE"

### 4. Integration
- **File**: `src/parsers/MultiPassTranscriptParser.ts`
- Updated to pass `trialStyleConfig` to `StructureAnalyzer`

## How It Works

1. During PDF conversion, the default `sectionMarkers` from `config/trialstyle.json` are merged with any trial-specific configurations
2. During Phase 1 parsing, the `StructureAnalyzer` checks each configured marker in order
3. The first matching marker triggers the section transition
4. If no configured markers match, it falls back to regex patterns for backward compatibility

## Trial-Specific Override Example

Trials can override the default markers by placing a `trialstyle.json` in their source directory:

```json
{
  "sectionMarkers": {
    "proceedings": [
      "TRIAL ON THE MERITS",
      "THE COURT:"
    ],
    "certification": [
      "OFFICIAL CERTIFICATION"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Affected Trials
This implementation addresses parsing issues for 50 transcript files across 18 trials, including:
- 32 Netlist V Samsung (7 files)
- 72 Taylor V Turner (2 files)
- 73 Tq Delta, Llc V. Commscope (6 files)
- And 15 other trials with partial affected files

## Testing Notes
- Line prefix detection updated to handle HH:MM and HH:MM:SS timestamp formats
- Properly extracts line prefixes (timestamps + line numbers or just line numbers) 
- Clean text (without prefix) is used for section marker detection
- Configuration merging works correctly with trial-specific overrides
- No regression in parsing files with standard markers

## Next Steps
- Monitor parsing results for the 50 affected files
- Consider adding more alternative markers based on trial analysis
- Potential future enhancement: ML-based section boundary detection
