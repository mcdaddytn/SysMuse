  "contextDescription": "Recognition and biometrics patents cover identification and authentication technologies. Key areas include facial recognition (2D and 3D), fingerprint sensing (capacitive, optical, ultrasonic), iris recognition, gesture recognition, and object detection. High-value applications include smartphone unlock (Face ID, fingerprint), access control, surveillance, and automotive (driver monitoring). This is a sensitive area with privacy regulations affecting deployment.",
  "scoringGuidance": [
    "Face unlock patents read on billions of smartphones globally.",
    "Under-display fingerprint sensing is a rapidly growing technology in premium phones.",
    "3D facial recognition (depth-based) has higher security and licensing value than 2D.",
    "Driver monitoring systems (DMS) are becoming mandatory in vehicles - growing market.",
    "Consider privacy regulation impact on deployment but not on patent value."
