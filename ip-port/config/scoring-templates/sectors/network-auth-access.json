  "contextDescription": "Network authentication and access control patents cover identity verification, session management, access policies, and perimeter security. Key technologies include LDAP, RADIUS, OAuth, SAML, PKI certificates, firewalls, VPNs, zero-trust architectures, SASE, SD-WAN, and container security.",
  "scoringGuidance": [
    "Authentication patents should be scored on their resistance to credential theft, replay attacks, and session hijacking.",
    "Access control patents focusing on policy granularity and dynamic authorization score higher.",
    "Zero-trust architecture patents that eliminate implicit trust should score highly on access_control_model.",
    "Patents with broad protocol support (SAML, OAuth, OIDC) score higher on protocol_scope.",
    "Cloud-native and SASE-aligned patents addressing hybrid connectivity are high value in current market.",
    "Container/microservices security patents that bridge orchestration with access control are emerging high-value areas."
